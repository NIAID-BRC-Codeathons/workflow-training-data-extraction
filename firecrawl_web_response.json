Measles can be dangerous, especially for infants and young children.\\n\\nOne out of every four people who get measles in the United States will be hospitalized. One or two out of every 1,000 children in the United States who get measles will die from the disease, even with the best care.\\n\\nMeasles can cause serious health problems, such as:\\n\\n- Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs.\\n- Brain damage caused by swelling.\\n- Deafness.\\n\\nYou can protect yourself and the people around you from measles. The best protection against measles is a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR or MMRV) vaccine.\\n\\nTwo doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles. The vaccine provides long-lasting protection against all strains of measles.\\n\\n## Measles 101\\n\\nClose all Open all\\n\\n### How it spreads\\n\\nMeasles is one of the most contagious diseases. The virus easily spreads from person to person. It can spread through coughing and sneezing. People who are infected can spread measles to others four days before, and up to four days after, the rash appears. The measles virus can stay in the air for up to two hours after a sick person coughs or sneezes.\\n\\nYou can get measles by **breathing contaminated air or touching an infected surface**, and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. That means you can catch measles nearly anywhere, such as the grocery store, movie theaters, or on a bus or plane. A vaccine is your best protection.\\n\\n### Signs and symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of measles start showing 10 to 21 days after getting infected. The first symptoms of measles may include:\\n\\n- Runny nose\\n- High fever (may be greater than 104 F)\\n- Tiredness\\n- Cough\\n- Red, watery eyes, or conjunctivitis (\u201cpink eye\u201d)\\n- A red rash with raised bumps that starts at the hairline and moves to the arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin\\n\\nThese early symptoms are followed by a rash that spreads over the body. The rash tends to appear three to five days after the first symptoms.\\n\\nMeasles can be serious in all age groups. However, there are several groups that are more likely to suffer from measles complications:\\n\\n- Children **younger than 5 years** of age\\n- Adults **older than 20 years** of age\\n- **Pregnant women**\\n- People with **compromised immune systems**, such as from leukemia or HIV infection\\n\\nCommon complications can include ear infections and diarrhea. Severe complications include pneumonia (infection of the lungs), encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and death.\\n\\nLearn more about the [signs and symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html) of measles from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website.\\n\\nThe only way to diagnose measles is through appropriate testing. If you think you have measles, it\u2019s important to see a doctor for a nose and throat swab and a blood test.\\n\\n### Treatment\\n\\nThere is no specific treatment for measles.\\n\\nIf you have measles, it\u2019s important to stay home so you don\u2019t spread measles to other people.\\n\\nCall your doctor if you are concerned about your symptoms. Medical care could help relieve symptoms and address complications, such as bacterial infections. Your doctor can tell you when it\u2019s safe to be around other people again.\\n\\n### Prevention\\n\\nThe MMR vaccine protects against measles, [mumps,](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/mumps.htm) and [rubella](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/rubella.htm). Two doses of the vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles.\\n\\nSee [Should I Get a Measles Booster, P-03713 (PDF)](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p03713.pdf)\\n\\n#### Children\\n\\nThe CDC recommends that children get two doses of the MMR vaccine.\\n\\n- The first doses is given between 12\u201315 months of age.\\n- The second dose is given between 4\u20136 years of age.\\n\\n#### Adults born before 1957\\n\\nAdults born before 1957 probably had measles, and do not need an MMR vaccine, unless they are in one of the groups below (international travelers or health care personnel).\\n\\n#### Adults born during or after 1957 who haven\u2019t had measles\\n\\nThe CDC recommends that adults born during or after 1957 who haven\\'t had measles should get one dose of MMR vaccine. Adults who are health care personnel, college students, or international travelers who do not have immunity (laboratory confirmation of measles disease or immunity) should get two doses of MMR vaccine.\\n\\nPeople who received a dose of measles vaccine from 1963\u20131967 may have gotten an inactivated measles vaccine that is not effective. People who were vaccinated between 1963\u20131967 should consult with a health care provider to determine if another dose of MMR vaccine is needed. Adults who are health care personnel, college students, or international travelers who got the inactivated measles vaccine between 1963\u20131967 should get two doses of MMR vaccine.\\n\\n#### College students\\n\\nThe CDC recommends that college students who did not have two doses of MMR vaccine as children, or who do not have immunity (laboratory evidence of immunity or confirmation of measles disease), get two doses of MMR, separated by at least 28 days.\\n\\n#### Health care personnel\\n\\nThe CDC recommends that health care personnel who did not have two doses of MMR vaccine as children, or who do not have immunity (laboratory evidence of immunity or confirmation of measles disease), get two doses of MMR, separated by at least 28 days.\\n\\n#### International travelers\\n\\nThe CDC recommends that people 6 months and older who will be traveling internationally should be protected against measles.\\n\\n- Babies 6\u201311 months should get one dose of MMR vaccine.\\n- Children 12 months and older should get two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.\\n- Adults who do not have immunity (laboratory evidence of immunity or confirmation of measles disease), should get two doses of MMR, separated by at least 28 days.\\n\\nFind out if you and your children are up to date on the measles vaccine. Check our Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) [Wisconsin Immunization Registry](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/wir.htm). If you\u2019re not up to date, call your doctor, pharmacy, or [local health department](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/lh-depts/counties.htm) to schedule the vaccine. If you are not able to find your vaccination records or documentation of measles immunity, the CDC recommends that you should get vaccinated. There is no harm in getting another dose of MMR vaccine if you may already be immune to measles (or mumps or rubella).\\n\\nIf you\u2019re worried about cost, your family may be eligible for free vaccines.

Case locations are mapped to county centroids.\\n\\n## The Current Situation with Measles\\n\\nTo date in 2025 measles outbreaks have been reported in multiple states, raising concerns about continued spread, increases in hospitalizations and deaths, and loss of measles elimination status, highlighting the importance of measles vaccination and rapid detection and reporting of suspected and confirmed measles cases.\\n\\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease spread primarily through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing tiny droplets containing the virus. People infected with measles have fever and a red, slightly raised rash. Some people with measles develop complications like ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, or inflammation of the brain itself, encephalitis, which can cause brain damage. Severe measles can lead to hospitalization and even death. The best way to prevent contracting measles is through measles vaccination. Having a high percentage of people fully vaccinated against measles is the best way to prevent outbreaks, and is also the best way to protect people who cannot get measles vaccines, such as babies or people with cancer.\\n\\n## U.S. Measles Cases Mapped\\n\\nThe maps above show the current geographic distribution of confirmed measles cases in 2025 by county across the United States, with the largest outbreak seen in west Texas from which other outbreaks have spread. The cumulative cases map includes measles cases reported for each county in the United States since January 1, 2025, revealing the relative scale of the outbreaks across states. The recent cases map includes only those cases reported within the past two weeks, providing a near real-time view of active transmission or newly imported cases. Blue dots represent locally acquired cases while red dots represent imported cases from out of jurisdiction (out of state or out of country) travel. As indicated by the relative size of the blue dots, most of the reported cases are due to local transmission, with relatively few cases being imported. Of the imported cases, the vast majority occur in travelers returning from other countries with ongoing measles outbreaks.\\n\\nIn addition to the measles maps, the following table shows the cumulative number and recent measles case counts, and whether imported or locally acquired, for each county (and state) where confirmed measles cases were reported in 2025.\\n\\nCounty LevelState Level\\n\\nImported and locally acquired measles cases by county in the United States, 2025\\n\\n### Imported and locally acquired measles cases by county in the United States, 2025\\n\\nPage 1 of 15\\n\\n|  |  | County | Imported | Local | Total | Recent 2 Weeks |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 |  | Gaines, Texas | 0 | 414 | 414 | 0 |\\n| 2 |  | Mohave, Arizona | 0 | 107 | 107 | 27 |\\n| 3 |  | Lea, New Mexico | 0 | 67 | 67 | 0 |\\n| 4 |  | El Paso, Texas | 0 | 61 | 61 | 0 |\\n| 5 |  | Terry, Texas | 0 | 60 | 60 | 0 |\\n| 6 |  | Lubbock, Texas | 0 | 52 | 52 | 0 |\\n| 7 |  | Southwest Health District, Utah | 0 | 51 | 51 | 7 |\\n| 8 |  | Oconto, Wisconsin | 9 | 27 | 36 | 0 |\\n| 9 |  | Spartanburg, South Carolina | 5 | 29 | 34 | 13 |\\n| 10 |  | Gray, Kansas | 0 | 29 | 29 | 0 |\\n| 11 |  | Lamar, Texas | 0 | 28 | 28 | 0 |\\n| 12 |  | Dawson, Texas | 0 | 26 | 26 | 0 |\\n| 13 |  | Haskell, Kansas | 0 | 21 | 21 | 0 |\\n| 14 |  | Yoakum, Texas | 0 | 20 | 20 | 0 |\\n| 210 |  | U.S. | 159 | 1,522 | 1,681 | 58 |\\n\\nTable with 5 columns and 210 rows.

The rate at which measles cases have increased in 2025 is similar to the rate in 2019 when there was a global measles resurgence - and more measles cases in the United States than in any year in the past three decades.\\n\\nThe time series below shows the increase in measles cases over time in the United States by year since 2018. The cumulative time series shows the total number of measles cases reported to date in 2025 compared with previous years. The sharp upward slope of the curve in 2025 reflects the rapid spread of measles virus this year. The weekly cases chart displays the number of reported measles cases by month since 2019, highlighting the magnitude of the current outbreak relative to recent years.

Case dates correspond to date of rash onset when available, although definitions vary by reporting jurisdiction. The dates on the x-axis represent the first day of each week.\\n\\n## Measles Cases by Vaccination Status\\n\\nMeasles vaccination is the best way to prevent measles and stop outbreaks. We see this clearly by looking at the vaccination status of measles cases in the United States. Unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status represent almost all reported measles cases. These outcomes are consistent with estimates that two doses of measles vaccine protects 97% of those vaccinated.\\n\\nPercentage of reported measles cases by vaccination status\\n\\n### Percentage of reported measles cases by vaccination status\\n\\n020406080100%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n94%\\n\\nVaccinated\\n\\nUnvaccinated or Unknown\\n\\nSource:Johns Hopkins University [Get the data](https://static.dwcdn.net/data/K8pv1.csv?v=1763056260000) [Download image](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/K8pv1/full.png)\\n\\n> \\\\\\\\* Vaccination status reports are aggregated from official state health department websites and official press releases. The \"unknown\" category includes both cases with documented unknown status and those where investigation is ongoing. Unvaccinated and unknown vaccination status are combined because some jurisdictions (including the state of Texas) report these in combination.\\n\\n## Measles Cases by Age\\n\\nBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in the United States in 1963, measles was largely a disease of young children. But measles cases now occur across all age groups. After widespread use of measles vaccine, unvaccinated individuals are less likely to be exposed to measles virus when growing up because they are protected from encountering the virus by vaccinated people in their community. However, when measles outbreaks do occur, as now in the United States, these susceptible adolescents and adults can get measles. The chart below shows the distribution of measles cases by age group in the United States in 2025. Many cases are in school age children, but older adolescents are also getting measles.\\n\\nU.S. measles cases by age\\n\\n### U.S. measles cases by age\\n\\n0-4 Yrs\\n\\n23%\\n\\n5-17 Yrs\\n\\n33%\\n\\n18+ Yrs\\n\\n30%\\n\\nUnknown\\n\\n14%\\n\\nSource:Johns Hopkins University [Get the data](https://static.dwcdn.net/data/4tlk9.csv?v=1763056260000) [Download image](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4tlk9/full.png)\\n\\n> \\\\\\\\* Age status of cases are aggregated from official state health department websites and official press releases.\\n\\n## Technical Notes\\n\\nThis dashboard is updated Mondays and Thursdays by end of day Eastern Time, with intermittent updates as warranted. The data presented in the maps are compiled from official sources, including state and county health departments and additional county-level news releases or news articles. The data represent all laboratory-confirmed measles cases reported by public health authorities in 2025. The data exclude \"probable cases\", cases not yet laboratory-confirmed, and cases not publicly reported. All reported cases are categorized as local unless indicated otherwise by the reporting source. Data completeness and timeliness vary by reporting jurisdiction. Recent case counts may be incomplete and are subject to backward revision as investigations are completed.

The case was identified in an emaciated 2.5-year-old doe that was continuously drinking water and walked directly up to the responding conservation officer.\\n\\n\"Genesee County was under focused CWD surveillance in 2022, when approximately 300 deer were tested, with none testing positive,\" the press release said. \"The DNR has continued to test deer that appear sick in Genesee County when possible.\"\\n\\n### **State\\'s first case in wild deer found in 2015**\\n\\n\"We appreciate the support and cooperation of the public as they continue to report sick deer so our team can follow up with the necessary testing for confirmation,\" Brent Rudolph, PhD, DNR deer, elk and moose management specialist, said in the release.\\n\\nSince CWD was first detected in Michigan wild deer in 2015, more than 110,000 deer have been tested for the disease in the state. In total, more than 144,000 wild deer have been tested since surveillance began in 2002, with 263 infected deer identified. Since direct hunter submissions of deer to the state\\'s veterinary diagnostic laboratory began in 2020, more than 3,200 samples have yielded 56 additional confirmed cases.\\n\\nWe appreciate the support and cooperation of the public as they continue to report sick deer so our team can follow up with the necessary testing for confirmation.\\n\\nBrent Rudolph, PhD\\n\\nCWD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cervids such as deer, elk, and moose. Caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions, the disease has also been found in Clinton, Dickinson, Eaton, Gratiot, Hillsdale, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Jackson, Kent, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, Ogemaw, and Washtenaw counties.\\n\\nNo cases of CWD infection have been reported in people, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that infected animals not be consumed by people or domestic animals.\\n\\nThe DNR said deer remains should be taken to a landfill or disposed of through regular bagged trash pickup. Deer harvested from known CWD-positive areas should never be left on the landscape.\\n\\n# Outpatient antibiotic use in COVID patients linked to \\'downstream\\' antibiotic resistance\\n\\nNews brief\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2025\\n\\n[Chris Dall, MA](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chris-dall-ma)\\n\\nTopics\\n\\n[Antimicrobial Stewardship](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship)\\n\\n![Gloved hand with pills](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/iStock-1286336605.jpg)Plyushkin / iStock\\n\\nA\\xa0[study](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2400108 \"(opens in a new window)\") of more than 50,000 Canadian seniors diagnosed as having COVID-19 during the first 18 months of the pandemic found that antibiotic use within 7 days of diagnosis was associated with detection of antibiotic resistance organisms, researchers reported today in _NEJM Evidence._\\n\\nThe population-wide cohort study, led by researchers with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, analyzed data on residents of Ontario aged 66 years and older who had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021.\\n\\nBecause antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients was common in the early months of the pandemic in most countries, particularly in older patients, the researchers wanted to evaluate the relationship between peri\u2013COVID-19 antibiotic exposure (within 7 days of index SARS-CoV-2 reporting) and isolation of an antibiotic-resistant organism from a clinical culture within 6 months.\\n\\nOf the 53,533 eligible patients included in the study, 8,228 (15%) were prescribed a peri\u2013COVID-19 antibiotic, and 1,477 (3%) had a downstream drug-resistant organism identified. Peri\u2013Covid-19 antibiotic use was significantly associated with the presence of any antibiotic-resistant organism (adjusted odds ratio \\\\[aOR\\\\], 1.24; 95% confidence interval \\\\[CI\\\\], 1.09 to 1.41) and the presence of gram-negative antibiotic-resistant organisms (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.46) but not gram-positive antibiotic-resistant organisms (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.48).\\n\\n### Stewardship in older adults, nursing home residents\\n\\nAmong all individuals who received an antibiotic, the attributable fraction of downstream antibiotic resistance related to peri\u2013Covid-19 antibiotic use was 17% (95% CI, 7% to 26%). Among all individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the population-attributable fraction of downstream antimicrobial resistance related to peri\u2013Covid-19 antibiotic use was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 7%).\\n\\n\"As antibiotics are often used in the outpatient setting in patients with Covid-19, without clear indications, this study suggests that a substantial burden of antimicrobial resistance in individuals with Covid-19 may have been avoidable,\" the study authors wrote\\n\\nThey add that the disproportionate impact on older, more vulnerable patients suggests that antimicrobial stewardship programs targeting antibiotic prescribing in older adults and those residing in nursing homes may be beneficial.\\n\\n# European Union launches One Health initiative for antimicrobial

Patients may have non-specific symptoms (fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis) without rash in the prodromal phase of infection, so heightened suspicion, particularly during local outbreaks or in patients with recent travel, can be key to timely diagnosis. The incubation period between exposure and initial symptoms is approximately 8-12 days. **For images of rash see the\\xa0_Red Book_** **chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\\n- **Diagnosis:** Measles virus infection can be confirmed by: (1) detection of measles viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); (2) detection of measles virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M; (3) a fourfold increase in measles IgG antibody concentration in paired acute and convalescent serum specimens (collected at least 10 days apart); or (4) isolation of measles virus in cell culture.\\n- **Who is at highest risk of acquiring measles infection:**\\n\\n  - Unvaccinated children or adults\\n  - Incompletely vaccinated (<2 doses of MMR) children or adults\\n  - Individuals with known exposure to measles or recent travel to areas with active measles transmission.\\n\\n- **Who is at highest risk of severe measles infection or complications of measles:**\\n\\n  - Infants and children aged less than 5 years\\n  - Adults aged more than 20 years\\n  - Pregnant women\\n  - People with compromised immune systems, such as from cancer, chemotherapy, or HIV infection\\n\\n- **Complications:** Measles can cause serious illness, even in previously healthy children. Complications of measles can include:\\n\\n  - Ear infections\\n  - Diarrhea\\n  - Pneumonia (either from measles virus itself or from bacterial superinfection)\\n  - Encephalitis\\n  - Death\\n  - In addition, measles infection increases the risk of other severe infections for months or years after measles through the mechanism of immune amnesia.\\n\\n- **Precautions for patients with suspected or confirmed measles infection**: Airborne precautions are needed whenever there is any suspicion of measles exposure. Promptly isolate, collect specimens, and report patients with suspected measles to public health.\\n- **Prevention of measles**: Vaccination is the cornerstone of measles prevention. All children should receive measles vaccination as part of the routine childhood vaccine schedule. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized children should begin catch-up vaccination as soon as possible. During an outbreak, MMR vaccine should be offered to all people with known exposure or in the outbreak community who lack evidence of measles immunity. During a community-wide outbreak that affects infants, MMR vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing symptoms after exposure and may be recommended for infants 6 through 11 months of age. Children who receive their first MMR vaccine prior to 12 months of age will require two additional doses after 12 months of age for full protection. IGIM administered exposed, measles-susceptible people (not previously vaccinated or immunocompromised) will prevent or attenuate infection if administered within 6 days of exposure.\\n- **Treatment:** There is no specific antiviral agent for treatment of measles infection. Treatment of children with measles with oral vitamin A decreases measles-related morbidity and mortality. Dosing of vitamin A for treatment of children with measles can be found in the **_Red Book_ chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\\n- **Reporting:** Involvement of state and local health departments is often advisable for any suspected diagnosis of measles, as there may be specific ways these departments wish to receive specimens and manage patients.\\n- **For more information see the _Red Book_** **chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- _Red Book_ chapters: [International Travel](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S1_006_010) \\\\| [Immune Globulin Intramuscular (IGIM)](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S1_005_002)\\n- _Red Book Online_ [webinars](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15686):\\n  - [Identifying and Diagnosing Measles in the Pediatric Setting](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/29920)\\n  - [The Use of Vitamin A in the Management of Measles](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/31246)\\n  - [Infection Prevention & Control for Measles](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/31754)\\n  - [Spotting a Threat: Measles in Immunocompromised Children](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15686)\\n- CDC: [Measles (Rubeola)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html)\\n\\n|     |\\n| --- |\\n| **Pediatric Practice Tools and Info**<br>Watch this CDC video to learn more about the signs and symptoms of measles to quickly diagnose infected patients.

These new measles cases can all be tied to either domestic or international travel and all of the new cases are among unvaccinated people. Health officials are urging families to make sure they are up to date on their immunizations, especially ahead of travel.\\n\\nSeven of the cases reported this week were within families who had recent domestic travel and were related to three other cases reported last week. Three additional but unrelated cases added this week were tied to international travel.\\n\\nMeasles has been on the rise around the country in 2025. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed more than 1,500 cases this year, the highest number since the U.S. reported 2,126 cases in 1992. There have also been three confirmed deaths from measles in the U.S. in 2025.\\n\\n\u201cThe significant increase in measles cases around the U.S. this year, and the fact that measles is still very prevalent in other countries, continues to highlight the urgency for families to make sure their children are up to date on their measles immunizations,\u201d said Myra Kunas, assistant commissioner for MDH's Health Protection Bureau. \u201cMeasles is one of the most infectious diseases on the planet. It spreads easily, and it finds those who are not vaccinated.\u201d\\n\\nThe immunization to protect against measles\u2014the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine\u2014is very effective. After one dose of vaccine, it is about 93% effective at preventing measles infection. After two doses, protection against infection rises to 97%. Decades of data also show that the [MMR vaccine is safe](https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/).\\n\\nChildren should receive the first vaccine dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. For all ages, it is important to talk to your doctor if you are going to be [traveling to another country](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/plan-for-travel.html) or an area of the U.S. with a measles outbreak. Children 6 to 12 months old can get an early dose of MMR vaccine if their travels will put them at high risk for measles. Your doctor can check to make sure you and your family are up to date on your immunizations and make sure you do not need any other immunizations.\\n\\nMDH encourages people to check their immunization records to confirm that they and their children have received the MMR vaccine. Minnesotans can also go to [Find My Immunization Record](https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/records.html). Most people born before 1957 have had measles disease and are considered immune.\\n\\nInitial symptoms of measles include a fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes followed by a rash that typically spreads from the head to the rest of the body. It generally takes eight to 12 days from exposure for someone with measles to develop the first symptoms. The measles rash usually appears two to three days after the fever begins.\\n\\nIf symptoms develop, people should call their health care provider before going to a clinic. Calling first is an important way to ensure that proper care is received without accidentally exposing other people to measles.\\n\\n\u201cThe awareness and recognition of measles symptoms is crucial in our efforts to prevent the spread of measles,\u201d said Jessica Hancock-Allen, director of the infectious disease division at MDH. \u201cWe are encouraging families to be aware of symptoms of measles, particularly the rash, and call their health care provider if they notice a rash--especially if their child is unvaccinated and has been exposed to someone with measles or has travelled recently. We are also reminding our health care provider partners to think about measles and ask about travel\u2014domestic or international\u2014and possible exposures if a patient has any symptoms of measles.\u201d\\n\\nPeople who have not been vaccinated and are exposed to measles will be asked to stay home from work, school, child care, public spaces and other activities for at least 21 days. Staying home is extremely important to help stop the spread of the disease to others since a person can be contagious even before symptoms start.\\n\\nMeasles is a highly contagious rash illness and can be a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Measles spreads easily by coughing, sneezing or even being in the same room with someone who has measles. The virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area.\\n\\nAdditional information about measles can be found on the MDH [Measles](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/index.html) website.\\n\\n**-MDH-**\\n\\n_**Media inquiries:**_\\n\\n**Garry Bowman**\\n\\n**MDH Communications**\\n\\n**651-529-5164**\\n\\n[**garry.bowman@state.mn.us**](mailto:garry.bowman@state.mn.us)\\n\\nTags\\n\\n- [news](https://www.health.state.mn.us/taxonomy/term/1216)\\n\\n**Last Updated:** 10/01/2025\" html=None raw_html=None json=None summary=None metadata=DocumentMetadata(title=' New measles cases lead state health officials to issue reminders about immunization, travel and symptoms - MN Dept. of Health', description=None, url='https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html', language='en', keywords=None, robots=None, og_title=None, og_description=None, og_url=None, og_image=None, og_audio=None, og_determiner=None, og_locale=None, og_locale_alternate=None, og_site_name=None, og_video=None, favicon='https://www.health.state.mn.us/themes/bootstrap_mdh/favicon.ico', dc_terms_created=None, dc_date_created=None, dc_date=None, dc_terms_type=None, dc_type=None, dc_terms_audience=None, dc_terms_subject=None, dc_subject=None, dc_description=None, dc_terms_keywords=None, modified_time=None, published_time=None, article_tag=None, article_section=None, source_url='https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html', status_code=200, scrape_id='8236e166-a32b-4bc3-b236-7f72b0e3f484', num_pages=None, content_type='text/html; charset=UTF-8', proxy_used='basic', cache_state='hit', cached_at='2025-11-13T17:47:49.079Z', credits_used=None, error=None) links=None images=None screenshot=None actions=None warning=None change_tracking=None branding=None",

DSHS is working with South Plains Public Health District and Lubbock Public Health to investigate the outbreak.\\n\\nAnd even more concerning, is that the latest measles case count likely represents only a fraction of the true number of infections. Health officials suspect 200 to 300 people in West Texas are infected but untested, and therefore not part of the state\u2019s official tally so far.\\n\\n###### **Outbreak Demographics**\\n\\nThe [outbreak](https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/14/texas-measles-outbreak-rises-48-cases/) is in a sparsely populated swath of rural Texas, near the New Mexico border, and has spread from its epicenter in Gaines County to include single-digit cases in Lynn, Terry and Yoakum counties.\\xa0The cases have been concentrated in a \u201cclose-knit, undervaccinated\u201d Mennonite community, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said. Gaines County is highly rural, so many of the families send their children to small private schools or are homeschooled, Anton said.\\n\\nMeasles cases were limited to rural areas surrounding [Lubbock, Texas](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163), the largest city in the region, until February 14th, when Lubbock Public Health\\xa0confirmed its first case.\\xa0People who live in Gaines County regularly head into Lubbock to shop and do other business. That includes a large number of unvaccinated people who may have been exposed to measles.\\n\\n\u201cCommunities who don\u2019t vaccinate are not necessarily isolated to their area. They commute to Lubbock,\u201d said Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock. \u201cBy doing that, they\u2019re taking the disease with them.\u201d\\n\\nSeveral of Montanez\u2019s young patients were exposed recently, she said, one just by sitting in the same clinic waiting room with another child who was later confirmed to have measles. That child had traveled from another county for care.\\n\\n###### **Outbreak Case Definition**\\n\\nOn March 6th, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) created an [outbreak case definition](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-case-definition), expanded the number of counties included in the outbreak area, and reiterated recommendations for immunization within that area.\\xa0This case definition defines the outbreak area as the following six counties (Dawson, Gaines, Lynn, Martin, Terry, and Yoakum), extending immunization recommendations to that area.\\xa0The geographic area considered as part of the outbreak will be evaluated on an ongoing basis and can be adjusted when there is enough epidemiologic evidence to support this.\\n\\nThose include considering an early dose of MMR vaccine for infants ages 6 to 11 months and a second dose for adults who have received only one. It also expands the definition of an epidemiologically linked confirmed case to include patients with a fever and rash who live in or have visited the outbreak area in the last 21 days.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### Measles Outbreak Timeline\\n\\n| ###### **Date** | ###### **Case Counts and Details** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **January 23, 2025** | [Two cases in unvaccinated adults from the same household with recent international travel in Harris County (Houston)](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/confirmed-case-measles-january-2025) |\\n| **January 29, 2025** | [South Plains Public Health District notified the public of a measles case in a Gaines County child](https://www.kcbd.com/2025/01/29/lubbock-public-health-confirms-positive-case-measles/) |\\n| **January 30, 2025** | [Second confirmed case in an unvaccinated school-age child in Gaines County (Lubbock).

The unvaccinated teenager with no recent travel or exposure to known cases from the Texas outbreak. On February 14th, the NMDOH reported that two adult residents of Lea County tested positive for measles, thus declaring a [measles outbreak](https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/2/?view=2180), based on the CDC\\'s criteria of three unrelated cases in Lea County.\\n\\nThe New Mexico Department of Health launched a [online state measles resource](https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/) on February 28th to provide guidance and information on the outbreak.\\n\\nOn March 6, a Lea County resident was found to have measles upon death. Following this news a sharp rise in cases followed, with cases jumping from 9 to 30 on [March 7th](https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/3/?view=2190).\\xa0The increase in case numbers reflects test results from the NMDOH Scientific Laboratory Division combined with cases discovered during epidemiologic investigations of known patients. These cases did not occur simultaneously, but were identified retrospectively, with many detected only after patients had already recovered from their illness.\\n\\nThe deceased, an unvaccinated Lea County adult, tested positive for measles after death and did not seek medical care before passing, according to laboratory confirmation from the NMDOH Scientific Laboratory Division, though the official cause of death remains under investigation by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### New Mexico Measles Outbreak\\n\\nNMDOH \\\\| Last Updated:\\xa0[March 11, 2025](https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/)\\n\\n###### **Measles Cases Demographics**\\n\\n| County | Case Count |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Lea | 32 |\\n| Eddy | 1 |\\n| **Total** | **33** |\\n\\n| Age Range | Cases | Percentage |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 0 - 4 year | 5 | 15% |\\n| 5 - 17 years | 8 | 24% |\\n| 18+ years | 18 | 55% |\\n| Pending | 2 | 6% |\\n\\n| Vaccination Status | Case Count |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Unvaccinated | 27 |\\n| At least one MMR dose | 1 |\\n| Unknown vaccination status | 5 |\\n\\n## CDC 2025 Measles Case Counts\\n\\n##### U.S. Measles Cases in 2025\\n\\n**In reversing the January 2, 2025 decision to only update their measles count monthly, on February 20, 2025 the CDC announced they would be updating their counts every Friday.**\\n\\n**As of [March 7, 2025](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/), a total of 222 measles cases were reported by 12 jurisdictions:**\\n\\n- Alaska\\n- California\\n- Florida\\n- Georgia\\n- Kentucky\\n- New Jersey\\n- New Mexico\\n- New York City\\n- Pennsylvania\\n- Rhode Island\\n- Texas\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n###### **Measles Cases by Demographic**\\n\\n| Age Group | Cases | Percentage of Total Cases |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Under 5 years | 75 | 34% |\\n| 5 - 19 years | 99 | 45% |\\n| 20+ years | 40 | 18% |\\n| Age unknown | 7 | 3% |\\n|  |  |  |\\n| **Vaccination Status** | **Cases** | **Percentage of Total Cases** |\\n| Unvaccinated or Unknown Vaccination Status | 209 | 94% |\\n| One MMR Dose | 9 | 4% |\\n| Two MMR Doses | 4 | 2% |\\n\\n###### **Hospitalization**\\n\\n**17%** of cases hospitalized (38 of 222) for isolation or for management of measles complications.\\n\\n| Age Group | Cases Hospitalized (Total by Age) | Percentage of Cases in Age Group |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Under 5 years | 21 (76) | 28% |\\n| 5 - 19 years | 11 (99) | 11% |\\n| 20+ years | 5 (40) | 13% |\\n| Age unknown | 1 (7) | 14% |\\n\\n###### **Deaths**\\n\\nThere have been **2** **confirmed deaths** from measles.

As of April 17, a total of 800 cases have been reported in the United States in 2025; 654 (82%) cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas have been associated with the ongoing outbreak. These cases represent an approximately 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024, and the second highest annual case count in the United States in 25 years. Overall, 771 (96%) patients have been unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status (77% were unvaccinated, and 14% had unknown vaccination status when excluding 590 cases reported by Texas, which requires explicit consent by law \\\\[i.e., opt-in\\\\] to enroll in the Texas Immunization Registry), 85 (11%) patients have been hospitalized, and three patients have died. Among 48 (6%) internationally imported cases, 44 (92%) occurred among U.S. residents. Endemic measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 as a direct result of high 2-dose childhood coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur when travelers with measles return to the United States while they are infectious; larger U.S. outbreaks typically follow importation into close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage. Nationally, risk for widespread measles transmission remains low because of high population-level immunity. To prepare for and prevent measles cases and outbreaks, public health departments should continue working with trusted community messengers on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and other community infection prevention approaches (e.g., case isolation, contact monitoring, and post-exposure prophylaxis) and coordinating with health care facilities and schools. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nMeasles is the most highly contagious febrile rash illness, infecting up to 90% of susceptible close contacts and resulting in serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Among the 4,056 measles cases reported in the United States during 2001\u20132022, a total of 727 (18%) were hospitalized, and three deaths were reported [\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN1); of the 727 hospitalized patients, 473 (65%) were unvaccinated, and 187 (26%) had unknown vaccination status ( [_1_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R1)). Worldwide, measles vaccination is estimated to have saved 93.7 million lives during 1974\u20132024 and played a substantial role in reducing childhood mortality ( [_2_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R2)) by preventing complications associated with measles and deaths from other infectious diseases as a consequence of measles-related immunosuppression ( [_3_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R3)).\\n\\nEndemic measles transmission was declared eliminated [\u2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN2) in the United States in 2000 after a change from a 1-dose to a 2-dose measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination schedule in 1989 ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R4)). However, a recent resurgence in global measles, resulting from COVID-19 pandemic\u2013related challenges in implementing measles vaccination routine services and campaigns, has increased the risk for imported cases and outbreaks in the United States, particularly when U.S. travelers are exposed to measles abroad and return to the United States while they are infectious ( [_5_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R5)). Although the United States still benefits from high population immunity from routine MMR vaccination, declining immunization rates among school-aged children and communities with already low vaccination coverage threaten a resurgence of measles, along with its potentially serious associated complications. For this report, CDC used national surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of measles cases and outbreaks reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025.\\n\\n## Methods\\n\\n### Data Source and Case Classification\\n\\nState health departments notify CDC of confirmed measles cases [\u00a7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN3) ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)) through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and directly (by email or telephone) to the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Measles vaccination status is ascertained by health departments during each case investigation; patients with written or electronic documentation of receipt of \u22651 dose of a measles-containing vaccine \u226514 days before rash onset are considered vaccinated, and all other patients are classified as unvaccinated or as having unknown measles vaccination status. [\u00b6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN4) Measles cases are classified by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists as internationally imported if 1) at least part of the exposure period (7\u201321 days before rash onset) occurred outside the United States, 2) rash onset occurred within 21 days of entering the United States, and 3) no known exposure to measles occurred in the United States. All other cases are classified as U.S.-acquired ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). For this analysis, patients with imported measles cases were classified as age-eligible for vaccination if they were aged \u22656 months and were not vaccinated according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R4)).\\n\\n### Analysis of Outbreaks\\n\\nA measles outbreak was defined as the occurrence of three or more epidemiologically linked [\\\\*\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN5) cases. Unique measles virus sequences are defined as those differing by at least one nucleotide in the N-450 sequence (i.e., the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminal 150 nucleoprotein amino acids) based on standard World Health Organization recommendations for describing sequence variants [\u2020\u2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN6) ( [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R7)). Patients with confirmed vaccine reactions (i.e., rash caused by a reaction to vaccine strain virus) were not included as persons with measles cases, as studies have found no confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission of the measles vaccine strain virus ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. [\u00a7\u00a7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN7)\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### Characteristics of Reported Measles Cases\\n\\nDuring January 1\u2013April 17, 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported in 25 U.S. jurisdictions ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#F1)). The highest number of weekly cases (99) was reported during the week ending March 22 ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#F2)). Median patient age was 9 years (IQR\\xa0=\\xa04\u201323 years); 249 (31%) patients were aged <5 years, 304 (38%) were aged 5\u201319 years, 231 (29%) were aged \u226520 years, and age was unknown for 16 (2%) patients ( [Table](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#T1)). Among all measles patients, 771 (96%) were unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, 10 (1%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and 19 (2%) had received 2 doses. For Texas cases, it was not possible to disaggregate unvaccinated patients from those with unknown vaccination status because the Texas Immunization Registry requires explicit consent by law (i.e., opt-in) to enroll. Among 210 measles patients (excluding 590 cases reported by Texas), 162 (77%) were unvaccinated, six (3%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, 12 (6%) had received 2 doses, and the vaccination status of 30 (14%) was unknown. Among all 800 cases, 790 (99%) occurred among U.S. residents. Overall, 85 (11%) patients were hospitalized; 56 (66%) of those were unvaccinated, one (1%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and the vaccination status of 28 (33%) was unknown. Three measles deaths were reported to CDC; two confirmed in Texas in unvaccinated school-aged children with no known underlying medical conditions, and one confirmed in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. Most cases (557; 70%) were laboratory-confirmed; among 251 (31%) cases from which specimens were available for molecular sequencing, all were confirmed as wild-type virus strain with 225 (90%) identified as genotype D8 and 26 (10%) as genotype B3.\\n\\n#### FIGURE 1.\\n\\n![The figure is a map of the United States illustrating the reported number of confirmed measles cases, by state, during January 1\u2013April 17, 2025.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6ba4/12021071/bc9194938090/mm7414a1-F1.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/figure/F1/)\\n\\nReported number of confirmed [\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN1) measles cases, by state (N = 800) \u2014 United States, January 1\u2013April 17, 2025\\n\\n\\\\\\\\* An acute febrile rash illness with laboratory confirmation of measles or a direct epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed measles case.\\n\\n#### FIGURE 2.\\n\\n![The figure is a histogram of the number of reported confirmed measles cases in the United States, by week of rash onset and importation status, during January 1\u2013April 17, 2025.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6ba4/12021071/dbb0435b4fb0/mm7414a1-F2.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/figure/F2/)\\n\\nNumber of reported confirmed [\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN1) measles cases, by week of rash onset and importation status (N = 800) \u2014 United States, January 1\u2013April 17, 2025 [\u2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN2)\\n\\n\\\\\\\\* An acute febrile rash illness with laboratory confirmation of measles or a direct epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed measles case.\\n\\n\u2020 Data are preliminary as of April 17, 2025.

Fifteen (31%) importations resulted in secondary cases. Among the 48 internationally imported measles cases, 33 (69%) patients were unvaccinated, one (2%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, four (8%) had received 2 doses, and the vaccination status of 10 (21%) patients was unknown. All 33 of the unvaccinated persons with imported measles were age-eligible for vaccination per ACIP, including 10 infant travelers aged 6\u201311 months. Source countries of the 48 imported measles cases included Canada (10 cases), Vietnam (10), Mexico (seven), Pakistan (three), the Philippines (two), Saudi Arabia (two), and one imported case each from Afghanistan, Australia, Guinea, Netherlands, Somalia, Spain, and Uganda; a source country could not be determined for seven travelers who visited multiple countries during their exposure period: Tanzania and United Arab Emirates (two cases); China, Japan, and Vietnam (one); France, South Korea, and Vietnam (one); Thailand and Vietnam (one); Indonesia and the Philippines (one); and Southeast Asia (one).\\n\\n### Measles Outbreaks\\n\\nTen measles outbreaks have been reported in 2025 [\u00b6\u00b6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN8); 751 (94%) of all reported confirmed measles cases were outbreak-associated. An imported source was identified for seven outbreaks, and the source of three outbreaks remains unknown. Outbreak-related cases have been reported in 12 states (Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas). The largest outbreak began among a close-knit community with low vaccination coverage in Gaines County, Texas in January 2025 and has accounted for 654 (82%) cases reported during 2025 (584 patients in 24 Texas counties, 63 patients in four New Mexico counties, and seven patients in northeastern Oklahoma); the source of this outbreak remains unknown. Thirty-seven confirmed cases in Kansas are suspected to be linked to this outbreak. In addition, an expanding outbreak in Chihuahua, Mexico [\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN9) began in late February after a Mexican resident became infected after reported travel to Gaines County, Texas. All 208 genotyped specimens obtained from measles patients in Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas were genotype D8, 196 (94%) of which had identical N-450 sequences; 12 differed by one nucleotide, which can be expected in prolonged outbreaks.\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nA total of 800 measles cases and 10 outbreaks were reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025, representing approximately a 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024. Most cases have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.\\n\\nOverall, 11% of measles patients have been hospitalized, and three deaths have been reported. Similar to previous years ( [_1_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R1)), nearly all (96%) cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, and 77% of cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated when excluding cases reported by Texas. Most (92%) imported cases occurred among U.S. residents returning to the United States while infectious and from all six World Health Organization regions. Adherence to standard measles control measures, including isolation and quarantine, as well as high vaccination coverage locally, prevented secondary transmission from most of these persons who were infectious after returning from travel abroad.\\n\\nMost cases reported during 2025 have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, resulting in the second largest outbreak in the United States since elimination was declared in 2000. During 2001\u20132023, approximately 90% of U.S. measles outbreaks with 50 or more cases occurred in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage ( [_8_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R8)). Such communities might have frequent communal gatherings and have concerns about engaging with public health and health care systems for testing, treatment, and vaccination. The United States, Canada, [\u2020\u2020\u2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN10) and Mexico are all experiencing large, expanding outbreaks in similar interconnected communities. Frequent travel among similar communities across multiple states and countries might facilitate the rapid spread of measles outbreaks. The risk for widespread measles transmission in the United States remains low because of high population immunity resulting from high measles vaccination coverage. However, recent increasing global measles incidence in areas frequently visited by U.S. travelers, coupled with declines in MMR vaccination coverage in many U.S. jurisdictions to <95% (the estimated population-level immunity necessary to prevent measles outbreaks), and spread of measles from ongoing domestic outbreaks to other jurisdictions, have increased the risk for ongoing measles transmission within the United States ( [_8_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R8), [_9_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R9)).\\n\\n### Limitations\\n\\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, imported cases were likely underreported because 30% of reported outbreaks had no known source. Second, outbreak-related cases were likely underreported because certain persons in affected communities might not engage with the health care and public health systems. Third, distinguishing unvaccinated patients from patients with unknown measles vaccination status in Texas was not possible; the Texas Immunization Registry legally requires explicit consent, or opt-in, for adults and by parent or guardian for children to enroll. [\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN11) Persons with no records available are considered to have an unverified vaccination history. Finally, definitive linkages between the large outbreak in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas and cases reported in Kansas could not be identified.\\n\\n### Implications for Public Health Practice\\n\\nTo protect against measles and its complications before traveling internationally, all persons aged \u226512 months should have documented receipt of 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine, and infants aged 6\u201311 months of age should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine ( [_10_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R10)). Persons residing in or traveling domestically to outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance, which is developed based on review and analysis of the local outbreak epidemiology ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). Infants aged <6 months are at high risk for measles complications but are too young to be vaccinated, and therefore depend upon population immunity and passively transferred maternal measles antibodies (from previously vaccinated or infected mothers) to prevent infections and related complications.\\n\\nHealth care providers continue to serve on the front lines to identify measles cases, alert public health departments [\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN12), ensure recommended testing, and implement measles isolation precautions to prevent health care\u2013associated and community-based transmission. Health care providers should consider measles in the differential diagnosis for all patients (especially those who are unvaccinated) who 1) have fever (temperature \u2265101\u00b0F \\\\[\u226538.3\u00b0C\\\\]) and a generalized maculopapular rash with cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis, 2) have recently traveled outside the country or to a U.S. region with a known measles outbreak, or 3) have other known or suspected exposure to measles ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). Although no specific Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved antiviral therapy for measles exists, rapid access to supportive care can help relieve symptoms and treat complications such as pneumonia and secondary bacterial and viral infections. Providers should also offer and encourage vaccination for eligible patients who lack presumptive evidence of immunity to measles ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R4)).\\n\\nPublic health departments might benefit from using a CDC checklist [\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\*\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN13) to help guide their readiness activities such as preparing for laboratory testing and data reporting needs, conducting tabletop exercises, and facilitating early engagement with communities with low vaccination coverage and their trusted messengers before measles and other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks occur. To identify communities at risk, public health departments should consider using both MMR vaccination coverage data from immunization information systems and kindergarten entry and vaccination exemption data from kindergarten entry records. Standard measles control interventions, including vaccination, isolation, quarantine, and postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., administration of MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure for certain persons) ( [_10_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R10)), might be challenging to implement in certain communities. Therefore, public health departments should consider partnering with trusted community messengers (e.g., clinicians and religious leaders) on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and potentially acceptable community infection control approaches. Coordination with health care facilities, early childhood education facilities and schools, and other congregate settings that surround or serve these communities to prepare for measles cases regarding appropriate infection prevention and control, testing, public health follow-up, and early childhood education or school exclusion policies is crucial to limit transmission. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\n\\nMichael Thomas, CDC; Sierrah Haas, Allison Zaldivar, Kansas Department of Health and Environment; Chad Smelser, New Mexico Department of Health; Anna Marie McSpadden, Ashlyn Wayman, Oklahoma State Department of Health.\\n\\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

DSHS is working with South Plains Public Health District and Lubbock Public Health to investigate the outbreak.\\n\\nAnd even more concerning, is that the latest measles case count likely represents only a fraction of the true number of infections. Health officials suspect 200 to 300 people in West Texas are infected but untested, and therefore not part of the state\u2019s official tally so far.\\n\\n###### **Outbreak Demographics**\\n\\nThe [outbreak](https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/14/texas-measles-outbreak-rises-48-cases/) is in a sparsely populated swath of rural Texas, near the New Mexico border, and has spread from its epicenter in Gaines County to include single-digit cases in Lynn, Terry and Yoakum counties.\\xa0The cases have been concentrated in a \u201cclose-knit, undervaccinated\u201d Mennonite community, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said. Gaines County is highly rural, so many of the families send their children to small private schools or are homeschooled, Anton said.\\n\\nMeasles cases were limited to rural areas surrounding [Lubbock, Texas](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163), the largest city in the region, until February 14th, when Lubbock Public Health\\xa0confirmed its first case.\\xa0People who live in Gaines County regularly head into Lubbock to shop and do other business. That includes a large number of unvaccinated people who may have been exposed to measles.\\n\\n\u201cCommunities who don\u2019t vaccinate are not necessarily isolated to their area. They commute to Lubbock,\u201d said Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock. \u201cBy doing that, they\u2019re taking the disease with them.\u201d\\n\\nSeveral of Montanez\u2019s young patients were exposed recently, she said, one just by sitting in the same clinic waiting room with another child who was later confirmed to have measles. That child had traveled from another county for care.\\n\\n###### **Outbreak Case Definition**\\n\\nOn March 6th, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) created an [outbreak case definition](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-case-definition), expanded the number of counties included in the outbreak area, and reiterated recommendations for immunization within that area.\\xa0This case definition defines the outbreak area as the following six counties (Dawson, Gaines, Lynn, Martin, Terry, and Yoakum), extending immunization recommendations to that area.\\xa0The geographic area considered as part of the outbreak will be evaluated on an ongoing basis and can be adjusted when there is enough epidemiologic evidence to support this.\\n\\nThose include considering an early dose of MMR vaccine for infants ages 6 to 11 months and a second dose for adults who have received only one. It also expands the definition of an epidemiologically linked confirmed case to include patients with a fever and rash who live in or have visited the outbreak area in the last 21 days.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n##### Measles Outbreak Timeline\\n\\n| ###### **Date** | ###### **Case Counts and Details** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| **January 23, 2025** | [Two cases in unvaccinated adults from the same household with recent international travel in Harris County (Houston)](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/confirmed-case-measles-january-2025) |\\n| **January 29, 2025** | [South Plains Public Health District notified the public of a measles case in a Gaines County child](https://www.kcbd.com/2025/01/29/lubbock-public-health-confirms-positive-case-measles/) |\\n| **January 30, 2025** | [Second confirmed case in an unvaccinated school-age child in Gaines County (Lubbock).
