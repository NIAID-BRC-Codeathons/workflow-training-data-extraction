However, in tropical regions of the northern hemisphere under a dry/wet season cycle, cases occurred seasonally. Our findings further support the seasonality of mpox zoonotic transmission risk.\n\nMpox, caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), remains a neglected tropical zoonotic disease of forested Central and West Africa ( [_1_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r1 \"1\")). Mpox epidemiology is poorly understood, and the MPXV animal reservoir remains unknown ( [_1_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r1 \"1\")). Risk factors for zoonotic infection reportedly include direct or indirect contact with wildlife among subsistence activities in forests ( [_2_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r2 \"2\")– [_4_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r4 \"4\")). Those characteristics may have evolved in West Africa because Nigeria reported sustained interhuman transmission of MPXV clade II in 2017, which led to the emergence of clade IIb and the global outbreak declared in May 2022 ( [_5_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r5 \"5\")). In Central Africa at the time of our study, however, mpox cases remain typically linked to short chains of interhuman transmission after zoonotic spillover ( [_1_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r1 \"1\")).\n\nAfter 1990, reported case numbers increased sharply for Congo Basin/clade I, then a sharp increase in West African/clade II began in 2000 ( [_1_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r1 \"1\")). The lack of systematic surveillance hinders investigative understanding of long-term temporal trends ( [_1_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r1 \"1\")) and potential seasonality. Available index case time series suggested seasonal changes in risk and high-risk periods: outbreaks occurred predominantly in September in the Central African Republic (CAR) ( [_6_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r6 \"6\")), and during June–August in different regions of Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ( [_7_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r7 \"7\")– [_11_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r11 \"11\")). We analyzed potential zoonotic transmission seasonality from reported mpox index cases in Africa during 1970–2021.\n\n### The Study\n\nWe systematically analyzed peer-reviewed and gray literature reporting mpox (formerly monkeypox) index cases from zoonotic origin in Africa during 1970–2021. We extracted index case geographic localization and occurrence dates for temporal and spatial analysis. We used the PubMed query (“1970”\\[Date-Publication\\]: “2021/12/31”\\[Date-Publication\\]) AND monkeypox AND Africa ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Figure 1).\n\nWe only included index cases defined as the first reported case presumed to result from zoonotic transmission in an epidemiologic outbreak investigation. We excluded cases outside Africa and those related to secondary interhuman transmission. We also excluded cases without PCR, viral isolation or culture, or electron microscopy confirmation; and cases without onset month or geographic localization ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Figure 2).\n\nWe defined index sites as locations with >1 index case. We extracted remotely sensed meteorologic (precipitation, daytime and nighttime temperature), topographic (altitude and slope), land use–land cover data, and fire occurrence data using a 10-km radius buffer zone around each site ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Table 1).\n\nWe conducted unsupervised clustering to regroup sites into climate and seasonality (hereafter climate), landscape, and environment profiles. For climate profiles, we included the average cumulative rainfall, daytime and nighttime temperature, and fire index values ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Table 1) for each month in a principal component analysis. We performed hierarchical clustering on principal components, including 99% of dataset inertia, by using R version 4.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)) and FactoMineR package ( [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html)). We grouped sites by maximizing within-group similarity and between-groups difference. Following the same approach, we used variables describing the percentage of each buffer occupied by each land use–land cover class (e.g., evergreen closed forest, cropland) and topographic variables to obtain landscape profiles. Finally, we combined the 2 sets of variables to generate combined environment profiles ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1)).\n\nWe used the Kruskall-Wallis test to first compare the distribution of latitudes by month of index case occurrence and then to compare months of occurrence according to site environmental characteristics defined by each profile. Using months as a quantitative variable enabled comparison of periods of the year rather than specific months. Sensitivity analyses determined whether the association remained when restricting the analysis to clade II and to recent (2001–2021) cases ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1)).\n\nWe identified 208 index cases: 145 reported from 53 peer-reviewed articles, 26 from 35 gray literature sources, and 37 from CAR national surveillance data ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Figure 2). After exclusion criteria, we retained 133 index cases from 113 sites; 64% were reported from 2000 onward ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Figure 2). Clade I represented 86% of index cases, and clade II represented 13%. DRC accounted for 44% of index cases, and CAR accounted for 33% ( [Table](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnT1)).\n\nIndex cases occurred at a median latitude of 3.44°N (range: −5.87 to 9.53). Index cases latitudes differed significantly across months (p = 0.0354). During January–July (April excluded), index cases mostly occurred <3.44°N, whereas during August–December, most cases occurred >3.44°N ( [Figure 1](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnF1)).\n\nWe excluded 4 index sites at high altitude (>1,000 m) and 1 Sahelian index site because rare mpox occurrence prevented seasonality characterization in those settings. The other 108 sites clustered into 4 climate profiles. The equatorial cool profile had temperatures <30°C and day-night amplitude <10°C, rainfall across all months, and site latitudes ranging from −4.00° to 4.00°N ( [Figure 2](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnF2), panels A, B). The northern cool wet-dry profile had similarly low temperatures and amplitude, a dry season during December–February, and site latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The northern hot wet-dry profile displayed temperatures >30°C during the hottest months, a marked dry season during November–March, and latitude sites in the northern hemisphere. The southern hot wet-dry profile had similarly hot temperatures, a dry season in May–August, and latitude sites in the southern hemisphere ( [Figure 2](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnF2), panels A, B). Index cases occurred mostly in the equatorial cool (33%), northern cool wet-dry (35%), and northern hot wet-dry profiles (17%) ( [Table](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnT1)).\n\nCases occurred throughout the year in the equatorial cool profile and varied seasonally in the 2 northern wet-dry profiles; cases were nearly absent during April–July ( [Figure 2](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnF2), panel C). Seasonality analysis remained inconclusive in the southern hot wet-dry profile, which had low sample size (n = 14). The distribution of index case months was significantly different between climate profiles (p = 0.004). That association persisted in sensitivity analyses (Appendix Tables 2, 3). Landscape and combined environment profiles had poorer association with the month of an index case ( [Appendix](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#tnAPP1) Tables 2, 3. Figures 4, 6, 7).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe showed that the monthly distribution of mpox index cases varied with latitude and was associated with specific climates across the main ecologic mpox niche, excluding high altitude and Sahelian sites. We identified high-risk and low-risk periods across the year in sites located in northern hemisphere climates with alternating dry and wet seasons (>50% of index cases analyzed).\n\nA potential high-risk season occurred during August–March, spanning the last 3 months of the rainy season and all the dry season. That finding suggests complex drivers likely related to human and wildlife ecology. Various seasonal activities can increase human contact with wildlife. During the wet season, human populations settle in forest camps to collect edible caterpillars ( [_6_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r6 \"6\")), a major source of protein and income ( [_12_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r12 \"12\")). Hunting and trapping activities, generally conducted year round, intensify during the dry season ( [_10_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r10 \"10\")). Likewise, dry season slash-and-burn activities tend to drive mammals, notably rodents, toward food resources in neighboring fields, resulting in closer contact with humans.\n\nMultiple obstacles, including access to healthcare, hinder exhaustive mpox reporting from endemic regions. Therefore, this analysis relied on a limited series of well-characterized index cases. Such data and indirect approaches were used extensively to study mpox ecologic niches ( [_13_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r13 \"13\")) and emerging diseases with similar surveillance gaps (e.g., Ebola virus) ( [_14_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r14 \"14\")). Our conclusion that MPXV zoonotic transmission risk could be seasonal in regions under a dry-wet season cycle warrants further investigation.\n\nOngoing climate and environmental changes could exacerbate potential underlying seasonal drivers of human MPXV exposure. Determining whether specific seasons or periods bring greater risk for human transmission can improve prevention and surveillance initiatives and contribute to identifying animal reservoirs. For this, a genuine One Health approach is crucial ( [_15_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/syn/en/article/30/5/23-0293.htm#r15 \"15\")).\n\nDr. Besombes is an infectious and tropical disease clinician and an epidemiologist, who works as a medical epidemiologist in the Emerging Diseases Epidemiology Unit at Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.

Here we describe the latest countries in the region newly reporting cases since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022.\n\nThe clade Ib MPXV outbreak, which began in September 2023 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is having an increasing number of cases in the country and also expanding to neighbouring countries. Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda have each reported their first mpox cases. Several of these cases have travel links to eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and each of these countries has identified clade Ib monkeypox virus (MPXV). Based on available epidemiological data, this clade has been spreading rapidly among adults through close physical contact, including sexual contact identified within networks of sex workers and their clients. As the virus spreads further, the affected groups are changing, with the virus also taking hold within households and other settings. Additionally, Cote d’Ivoire is reporting cases of clade II mpox for the first time since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022.\n\n\n### Description of the situation\n\nDescribed below are the latest countries in the African region newly affected by mpox, either clade I or clade II, since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022. Additional countries in the region are continuing to report cases, please refer to the [dashboard recently published](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/) for an update on these countries including the latest epidemiological trends.\n\n**Central and East Africa**\n\n_Burundi_\n\nOn 25 July 2024, the Ministry of Health of Burundi declared an outbreak of mpox following the confirmation of three cases by the National Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health. These cases were identified on 22 July; one case from Kamenge University Hospital, a second case from Kamenge Military Hospital, and the third case from Isare Health District. They reported symptom onset on 24 July including fever, joint pain, and a widespread rash. Samples collected during a multidisciplinary investigation tested positive for mpox on 25 July with PCR. These are the first confirmed mpox cases ever identified in Burundi.\n\nAs of 17 August 2024, there had been 545 alerts of mpox cases since the outbreak declaration, of which 474 suspected cases (86.9%) had been investigated and validated. Of 358 suspected cases tested, 142 (39.7%) tested positive for MPXV. Genomic sequencing analysis has confirmed clade Ib MPXV. No deaths were reported as of 17 August.\n\nConfirmed cases have been reported from 26 of the 49 districts (53.1%). The most affected district is Bujumbura Nord, an urban area, with 54 of the 142 confirmed cases (38%). No deaths had been documented at the time of reporting.\n\nMales account for 55.6% of the cases and females for 44.4%. Children under the age of five years make up 28.9% of the cases, followed by those aged from 11 to 20 years (20.4%), and those aged from 21 to 30 years (18.3%). **\\***\n\n_Kenya_\n\nOn 29 July 2024, the Ministry of Health confirmed a case of mpox in Taita Taveta County bordering Tanzania. The patient is a 42-year-old Kenyan male residing in Kiambu County (neighbouring Nairobi). The case has a history of travel from Kampala, Uganda, to Mombasa, Kenya, and at the time of identification, the patient was travelling to Rwanda through Tanzania.\n\nAs of 13 August, a total of 14 suspected cases had been identified, one case had tested positive for MPXV Clade Ib,12 suspected cases had tested negative, and the test result for one case was pending. This is the first mpox case ever identified in Kenya. No deaths had been reported as of 13 August.\n\n_Rwanda_\n\nOn 24 July 2024, IHR National Focal Point (NFP) for Rwanda notified WHO of two laboratory-confirmed mpox cases in Rwanda, and on 27 July, the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of mpox in the country. The cases included a 33-year-old female (case 1) who frequently travels to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and a 34-year-old male (case 2) with a recent travel history to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Case 1 was identified at a point of entry (PoE) and isolated in Rusizi district, and case 2 was identified at Kibagabaga hospital of Gasabo district. Both cases were reported to be in stable condition and under continuous medical follow-up. These are the first confirmed mpox cases ever identified in Rwanda.\n\nAs of 7 August 2024, four confirmed mpox cases and zero deaths had cumulatively been reported by the country. Among the two new cases, one is a 34-year-old male, residing in Gasabo District in Kigali. His symptoms started on 15 July 2024 with fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, and rashes on the arms, face and genitals. He had travelled back from Burundi on 12 July 2024 and is currently in isolation. Five close contacts are under follow up. The other case is a 39-year-old Rwandan male, resident of Kicukiro District with travel history to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He had similar symptoms, along with headache, which started on 12 July 2024. Four of his close contacts have been identified and they are under follow up. Sequencing analysis has confirmed MPXV Clade Ib.\n\n_Uganda_\n\nIn June and early July 2024, Kasese District enhanced surveillance for mpox disease along the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo in light of reported increasing cases in the neighbouring country. Following the orientation of screeners at the Bwera point of entry and Bwera Hospital, six suspected cases were identified on 11 July. Samples were collected for laboratory testing from the suspected cases, two of which tested positive for MPXV Clade Ib on 15 July. The first of the confirmed cases is a 37-year-old female and the second case is a 22-year-old female national of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These are the first mpox cases identified in the country. Both cases had onset of symptoms on 11 July and were confirmed by a PCR test at the Uganda Virus Research Institute on 15 July 2024.\n\nInvestigations revealed that transmission occurred outside Uganda and no secondary transmission has been linked to the two cases as of 12 August 2024. By the same date, 39 suspected cases had been reported. Furthermore, 37 contacts of the confirmed cases were under follow-up. No deaths have been reported as of 20 August.\n\n**West Africa**\n\n_Côte d’Ivoire_\n\nIn July 2024, Côte d’Ivoire confirmed two non-fatal cases of mpox. The first case is a 46-year-old patient who consulted a doctor on 1 July with a fever, headache and skin rash, in Tabou district, San Pedro region, on the border with Liberia. Mpox was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Côte d'Ivoire laboratory on 3 July and again on 14 July by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar. The second case is a 20-year-old patient, in the Koumassi health district in Abidjan, who presented with skin rash and oral mucosal lesions on 14 July. No epidemiological link between these first two cases has been identified.\n\nAs of 7 August 2024, seven mpox cases had been confirmed in three health districts: Koumassi (one case), Tabou (one case), and Yopougon-Ouest-Songon (five cases). Four of the confirmed cases (57%) are male, and all seven cases are above 15 years of age.  Forty contacts have been identified and are being followed up. The country has previously reported mpox, but no cases had been notified since the start of the multi-country outbreak in 2022. The newly detected cases in 2024 belong to clade II MPXV.\n\n### Epidemiology\n\nMpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). There are two known clades of MPXV: clade I, previously called the Congo Basin clade, which includes subclades Ia and the recently identified Ib; and clade II, previously called the West African clade, which includes subclades IIa and IIb. Subclades Ia and Ib have been defined based on the emergence of subclade Ib in the South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it has predominantly spread through sexual contact. Subclade Ia is currently considered to encompass all other strains of Clade I that are not Ib.\n\nMPXV transmits between humans through close contact with lesions, body fluids, infectious respiratory particles or contaminated materials, or from animals to humans through contact with live animals or consumption of contaminated bushmeat. Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week of exposure but can start one to 21 days later. Symptoms typically last for two to four weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Normally, fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first, followed by skin and mucosal rash. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is also a typical feature of mpox, present in most cases. Transmission through sexual contact has been observed to lead to the appearance sometimes of only genital lesions. Children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems are at risk of developing complications and dying of mpox.\n\nIt is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also concurrently have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child or adult with suspected mpox may have chickenpox. For these reasons, laboratory testing is important for confirmation of mpox, particularly for the first cases in an outbreak or new geographic area.\n\nThe primary diagnostic test for MPXV infection is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. However, while a positive result of oropharyngeal, anal or rectal sample confirms mpox, a negative result is not enough to rule out MPXV infection. Testing of blood is not recommended. Serology does not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses and is therefore restricted to reference laboratories where antibody detection methods may be applied for retrospective case classification or in special studies.\n\nTreatment is based primarily on managing clinical symptoms, ensuring skin care, reducing pain, and preventing and managing complications. Where available through emergency or compassionate use programmes, specific antiviral medications such as tecovirimat can also be used in the treatment of mpox, particularly for severe cases or individuals at higher risk of complications.\n\nThree vaccines are currently available for use to prevent mpox in different countries (MVA-BN, LC16-KMB, and OrthopoxVac - the latter not yet commercialized). WHO recommends use of MVA-BN or LC16 vaccines when the others are not available.\n\nVaccination is recommended by WHO for individuals at high risk of exposure.\n\n### Public health response\n\n**Coordination**\n\nThe WHO African Regional Office (AFRO) reviewed and expanded the regional incident management support team to ensure that Member States receive the necessary support for managing the mpox outbreak. A critical meeting held in South Africa discussed urgent measures to address the rising number of mpox cases. It also proposed a review of the regional risk assessment given the acute situation. WHO has engaged in technical coordination meetings with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) to develop a joint mpox taskforce. Additionally, both organizations agreed on actions to accelerate the operational response, particularly in strengthening the technical working group on vaccines and enhancing cross-border readiness and surveillance.\n\n**Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)**\n\nThere is ongoing development of an RCCE operational plan in Sud-Kivu, with regular partner meetings to coordinate efforts. Online social listening software called DIGIMIND has been employed to capture discussions and rumours about mpox. This data is analysed to produce reports that inform risk communication strategies. A series of briefings were conducted for 141 stakeholders, including journalists, social mobilizers, and community leaders in South-Kivu and Sankuru Provinces.\n\nWHO has produced and broadcast interactive programs in multiple regions and languages, conducted public sensitization, and engaged in home visits and advocacy with political authorities to raise awareness and manage the outbreak.\n\n**Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)**\n\nAn IPC Rapid Assessment Tool (RAT) for health facilities has been developed and disseminated to countries that are experiencing an active outbreak of mpox, in order to rapidly assess IPC and WASH capacities to care for mpox patients safely in health facilities. Countries are encouraged to work with partners to support improvements as identified through this rapid assessment.  WHO has also published [posters for health and care workers on how to put on and remove personal protective equipment](https://www.who.int/teams/health-care-readiness/infection-prevention-and-control). WHO is also coordinating actions with IPC focal points in countries currently experiencing an active outbreak of mpox. WHO is supporting South Africa through a review of protocols, national IPC guidelines for mpox and strengthening the capacity of health and care workers through training.\n\n**Preparedness and Readiness**\n\nWHO is supporting Member States to increase their preparedness and readiness capacities. Additionally, South Africa has undergone subnational readiness assessments, focusing on non-affected provinces. The organization is supporting the development of contingency plans in priority and bordering countries and will continue to provide technical support to address gaps in readiness.\n\n**Surveillance**\n\nWHO continuously collects and analyses data from affected countries to monitor the spread and impact of the mpox outbreak, utilizing epidemiological tools to identify trends and transmission patterns. WHO also provides real-time situation reports and implements dashboards to help stakeholders interpret complex data. Training sessions and workshops are conducted for national surveillance teams, along with the development and distribution of guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistent surveillance activities.\n\nWHO supports the upgrading of surveillance infrastructure and the implementation of community-based surveillance programs, particularly in high-risk areas such as Internally Displaced People’s (IDP) camps. In the short term, WHO’s focus is on implementing standardized protocols, deploying real-time reporting systems, enhancing data integration and sharing, building local capacity, and strengthening early warning systems.\n\n**Laboratory**\n\nWHO has supported the procurement of laboratory reagents for South Africa and Liberia, and aims to improve logistics for specimen collection and transportation, ensuring timely delivery and adequate supplies across all health facilities. Countries are encouraged to sequence a subset of samples to monitor evolutionary trends and transmission partners.\n\n**Vaccination**\n\nWHO supports countries in obtaining regulatory approval for vaccine products, identifying target populations, and developing vaccination strategies. WHO provided technical support for a vaccination strategy workshop took place in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ahead of anticipated deployment of mpox vaccines in the country. WHO is assisting countries in developing research protocols to address existing data gaps.\n\n**Case Management**\n\nWHO is supporting the distribution of mpox therapeutics (tecovirimat) to South Africa. Participation in clinical webinars and review of guidelines for mpox dead body management are ongoing. Future efforts include engaging with WHO Country Offices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa to develop clinical case identification job aids, creating home-based care guidelines for mild mpox cases, and collaborating with neighbouring countries to enhance regional preparedness.\n\n**Response measures by country**\n\n_Burundi_\n\n- The national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated, with support from WHO.\n\n- An alert system is in place and surveillance field visits are taking place for validation of alerts, investigation of suspected mpox cases, and contact tracing for confirmed cases. However, the current resources are limited and not sufficient for all surveillance activities.\n\n- Laboratory sample analysis is performed at the National Reference Laboratory which has received technical and reagent support from WHO and partners but, nevertheless, faces resource challenges.\n\n- Most cases are treated and isolated in hospitals because of the absence of isolation conditions in other health facilities. Case management consists of syndromic treatment of mpox.\n\n- RCCE activities are ongoing to advise the population on protecting themselves from contracting the disease. Nevertheless, the awareness about the disease among patients and healthcare workers is limited and must be enhanced at all levels.\n\n\n_Kenya_\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the mpox case in Kenya, the Ministry of Health has undertaken various response measures, including:\n\n- Public Health Emergency Operations has been activated.\n- Incident Management Teams have been established to coordinate the response activities.\n\n- Draft national mpox response plan and case management guidelines have been developed.\n\n- Contact tracing of all patient’s close contacts along the travel itinerary in the country is ongoing.\n\n- There is heightened surveillance in all counties along the Busia to Mombasa highway and the Mombasa to Taveta Road, to identify all contacts and any other unidentified cases.\n\n- Mpox case definition has been developed and shared with all counties.\n\n- Cross-border communication with health authorities in neighbouring countries where the patient travelled to trace all potential contacts is ongoing.\n\n- Rapid Response Teams have been deployed to support affected counties with detailed investigations.\n\n- The evolution of outbreaks in neighbouring countries is being monitored to assess the risk of regional transmission and adjust response measures accordingly.\n\n- Public sensitization in all counties is ongoing to sensitize on the outbreak, necessary preventive measures, and steps to take if they contract the disease, including frequent handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizer, seeking early treatment, and avoiding close contact with sick persons.\n\n- Emergency Hotline Numbers have been provided for the public to report suspected cases and seek further information about the outbreak.\n\n- The Ministry of Health issued advisories to the health workers and the public, risk communication messages have been developed and disseminated to the public and at the Points of Entry (PoEs).\n\n\n_Rwanda_\n\nAfter the confirmation of two mpox cases, the Ministry of Health and relevant stakeholders went to Rusizi and Rubavu Districts, which are bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo where mpox cases are increasing, to conduct a situation analysis which led to the investigations of the confirmed cases. Efforts to contain cases are actively underway, with thorough contact tracing and active case search in high-risk groups in Rubavu, Rusizi, Kicukiro and Gasabo districts. The Ministry of Health, in collaboration with its partners, is continuing to implement the following response interventions:\n\nCoordination leadership:\n\n- National Rapid Response Team (RRT) was deployed to support Rusizi and Rubavu Districts and conduct a rapid situation assessment.\n- A national mpox contingency plan and management guidelines were developed.\n- Stakeholders' dissemination meeting was held on 1 August.\n-  A functional mpox Command Post was set up.\n\n\nSurveillance:\n\n- Surveillance has been heightened at PoEs, community, and at health facilities.\n- Data collection for suspected and confirmed cases and their contacts.\n- Contact tracing and follow-up of close contacts to confirmed cases.\n\nRCCE:\n\n- Audio and video spots development.\n- TV and radio program on mpox outbreak.\n- Translated mpox awareness materials at PoEs.\n- Social media assets on mpox awareness and social media influencer engagement on mpox awareness.\n\nCase Management and IPC:\n\n- Isolation and case management of confirmed cases are ongoing.\n- Training of Trainers (ToT) for healthcare providers on case management, IPC and referral of suspected cases for testing.\n- ToT for community health workers on case identification, IPC and referral of suspected cases at health facilities.\n\nDiagnostic and laboratory capacity:\n\n- Ongoing testing of suspected cases and the country has capacity to conduct PCR and genomic sequencing.\n- ToT for laboratory technicians on mpox sampling.\n\n\n_Uganda_\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the mpox cases in Uganda, various response measures have been undertaken, including:\n\n- The Ministry of Health and partners, including the WHO, have deployed members of the national and district RRTs.\n- A preparedness and response plan are in place, having been approved by the National Task Force of the Ministry of Health.\n- The country has employed the Incident Management System (IMS) to respond to all public health emergencies, including the current mpox outbreak.\n- Active case-finding is ongoing in all the high-risk and moderate-risk local sub-counties and health facilities, samples are being collected from suspected cases and shipped to both the field-based and national laboratory for testing.\n\n_Côte d’Ivoire_\n\n- The government activated the Public Health Emergency Operations Center on 15 July 2024.\n- Epidemiological surveillance has been strengthened, including preparation and distribution of surveillance guidance, as well as contact tracing and contact follow-up. All cases are being investigated and active case and contact search is ongoing.\n- Diagnostic capacity has been strengthened and sampling kits have been provided.\n- Treatment and isolation are ongoing in hospitals and in the community, and IPC measures around cases and health facilities have been strengthened.\n- Public awareness campaigns have also been implemented to inform citizens about preventive measures through mass media channels.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nThe current expansion of mpox in the African continent is unprecedented. At least four countries have identified cases for the first time and others, such as Côte d’Ivoire, are reporting re-emerging outbreaks. The modes of transmission in these countries are not fully described yet and are likely to include exclusive human-to-human transmission.\n\nClade I mpox is being identified for the first time outside of the countries that had been previously affected. Initial transmission in the newly affected countries in East Africa and beyond has been linked to travel to or from the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the expansion of the outbreak in Burundi suggests that in some settings, there may already be sustained community transmission. Epidemiological links between confirmed cases are not always known, therefore, multiple transmission chains might be ongoing in the different countries, and more undetected cases in the community are likely. Based on available epidemiological data, this clade has been spreading rapidly among adults through close physical contact, including sexual contact identified within networks of sex workers and their clients. As the virus spreads further, the affected groups are changing, with the virus also taking hold within households and other settings.\n\nIn areas or congregate settings with high population density as well in high-risk sexual networks, transmission could lead to explosive outbreaks, further compounded by population movements or insecurity. Conversely, the virus can also spread silently along commercial travel routes as in some cases symptoms may be less severe, access to health services in transit may be limited or concerns about stigma may cause persons affected to avoid seeking care.\n\nWhile vaccination against smallpox was shown in the past to be cross-protective against mpox, any immunity from smallpox vaccination will only be present in persons over the age of 42 to 50 years or older, since natural exposure to smallpox and smallpox vaccination programmes ended in 1980 after smallpox eradication. None of the four newly affected countries has access to mpox vaccines or antivirals.\n\nBased on the above, WHO has separately assessed the risk of mpox in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries as high and in Cote d’Ivoire, and other West African countries as moderate. This risk applies to the general population, especially those who have sexual contact with a mpox case, as well as health workers if they are not taking appropriate precautions when examining, testing and treating mpox cases.\n\nCurrently no deaths have been reported in the five above mentioned countries, however, there is the potential for increased health impact with wider spread among vulnerable groups such as children, immunocompromised individuals, including persons with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, or pregnant women in whom mpox can be more severe.\n\nThere is concern that the mpox outbreak in Africa will continue to evolve given:\n\n- The evidence of possible under-detection and under-reporting of local transmission. Many reported cases have no established epidemiological link and have been identified in different countries and in different locations within each country.\n\n\n- While all of the governments have activated emergency responses in the countries, with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond remain limited in some of the countries, and resource mobilization may be slow. Technical and financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at national and provincial/local levels.\n\n\n- Although the governments and partners are all mobilized to support adequate patient care for affected patients and introduce vaccines for people at risk, these measures are currently not in place in most countries in Africa, and their acquisition and roll-out will still require some time for implementation.\n\n\n- Since some of the countries have not reported mpox before, public awareness of the disease, as well as knowledge about and capacity for identifying it among health and care workers in newly affected countries remains limited.\n\n\n- Concurrently, the global multi-country outbreak of mpox is still ongoing. Countries outside of Africa that seemed to have achieved control of human-to-human transmission continue to detect sporadic cases \\` outbreaks, and an unprecedented increase of cases and reporting countries has been observed in the African Region, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, increasing the risk of further transmission in the region and the whole world.\n\n\n### WHO advice\n\n**General**\n\nHealth authorities and clinicians/health and care workers of all countries should be aware that the global mpox outbreak linked to clade IIb MPXV is ongoing in all WHO regions, and Clade I monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreaks are increasing in Central and East Africa, therefore, the risk of cross-border and international spread persists.\n\nWHO strongly advises that countries continue to follow the [Standing Recommendations of the Director-General of the WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/standing-recommendations-for-mpox-issued-by-the-director-general-of-the-world-health-organization-(who)-in-accordance-with-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)) issued in August 2023 and extended for another year, as well as the [Temporary Recommendations](https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2024-first-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024) issued by the Director General after the declaration of the PHEIC.\n\nCountries need to have in place mpox epidemiological surveillance and strengthen laboratory diagnostic capacities in line with updated WHO interim guidance, including genomic sequencing of viruses. Additionally, countries need to have diagnostic capacities capable of detecting both MPXV clades.\n\nThere must be sustained implementation of risk communication and community engagement appropriate to each context, maintenance or initiation of vaccination (where available) for persons at risk, optimal case management, adherence to infection control measures, strengthening research to better appreciate modes of transmission in different contexts, and sustained support for the development of rapid diagnostic methods and treatments adapted to the needs of patients.\n\nWhere circulation remains low, health authorities should strive to achieve the elimination of human-to-human transmission of mpox and ensure the maintenance of capacity for outbreak response.\n\nAnyone with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of mpox should follow the instructions of health authorities according to the local context, possibly including isolation during the infectious period. Mpox cases should avoid travel, including international travel, unless the reason for travel is seeking mpox medical care, until they do not present any mpox symptoms and the scabs of their lesions have fallen off. Contacts of a confirmed case are asked to limit their movements (and, if necessary, to abstain from sexual relations) for 21 days, the monitoring period for the appearance of possible symptoms.\n\nSmallpox vaccines composed of vaccinia virus also protect against mpox, cross-protecting due to the antigenic similarity of the viruses. Vaccination against mpox is recommended for people possibly at risk of contracting the disease. Mass vaccination is not required nor recommended for mpox at this time.\n\nFor specific antiviral treatments currently being assessed for effectiveness against mpox, such as tecovirimat, access is possible through a request from WHO for compassionate use, application for use under the [WHO](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/352902) MEURI protocol or direct purchase from the manufacturer.\n\nIt is essential to deepen knowledge in different contexts on the epidemiological links between mpox and HIV infection, their respective and common risk factors for infection and progression to severe disease, optimal case management in the event of co-infection and the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic approaches.\n\n**In the community**\n\nRCCE activities are vital in motivating affected communities to become aware of the risks and protective behaviours, as well as to understand, prevent and combat stigma and discrimination. Key audiences should be identified, which depending on the context may include health professionals, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, trans- and gender-diverse individuals, people working at or attending venues and events where sexual activity takes place, and people at risk of more serious illness (including persons living with untreated or poorly controlled HIV infection).\n\nPlease refer to the [WHO RCCE toolkit for mpox](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240091559) for further guidance on risk communication and community engagement.\n\nIt is also crucial that IPC and WASH measures be followed within the community to prevent and control transmission of mpox. Patients diagnosed with non-severe mpox can be isolated at home for the duration of the infectious period, provided a home assessment confirms that IPC and WASH conditions are met in the home setting. Patients being cared for at home should remain in a dedicated, well-ventilated room (e.g., with frequently opened windows) separate from other household members. Items such as eating utensils, linens, towels, electronic devices, and beds should be used exclusively by the person with mpox. Personal items should not be shared. If a health or care worker provides care at home, they should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (gloves, gown, eye protection, and respirator), perform hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) according to [WHO's 5 moments](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/five-moments-for-hand-hygiene), and clean and disinfect any patient care equipment used and frequently touched surfaces or items. Contaminated laundry from an infected person should not be mixed with other laundry and should be managed in a way that does not produce splashes and particles in the air. Contaminated laundry can be washed in a washing machine using detergent.\\[1\\] Waste generated in the infected person’s area should be placed in a strong bag, securely tied before disposal into the general waste stream (not recycling). Hand hygiene should be performed immediately after disposing of waste.\n\nPlease refer to “ [Clinical management and infection prevention and control for monkeypox: Interim rapid response guidance](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MPX-Clinical-and-IPC-2022.1)” for further guidance on IPC measures in community settings.\n\n**In healthcare settings**\n\nImplementing IPC and WASH measures in healthcare settings is necessary to prevent and control the transmission of mpox. It is important to train health and care workers on the modes of transmission for mpox and the control measures, including following standard and transmission-based precautions to prevent and control transmission of mpox. Screening of patients for mpox followed by appropriate patient placement and isolation should be in place. Health-care facilities should ensure health and care workers have access to and appropriately wear PPE (gloves, gown, eye protection, and respirator), adhere to [WHO's Five Moments](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/five-moments-for-hand-hygiene) for hand hygiene using soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub and ensure frequent cleaning and disinfection of the patient environment. Health and care workers should be reminded to handle and dispose of sharps safely and where possible and avoid the use of sharps on lesions (e.g. avoid deroofing) when collecting specimens. All bodily fluids and solid waste from patients with mpox should be treated as infectious waste. For further guidance on IPC measures that are required when caring for patients with mpox, please refer to the [Clinical Management and infection prevention and control for mpox: Interim rapid response guidance](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MPX-Clinical-and-IPC-2022.1).\n\nFully functioning water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and health care waste management services are a critical aspect of IPC practices and ensuring patient safety and quality of care. To ensure that the health care facility is compliant with imperative WASH standards, please refer to WASH FIT: A practical guide for improving quality of care through water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities.\\[2\\]\n\nWhile protecting themselves with recommended measures, health and care workers should also ensure that the stigmatization of patients with mpox presenting for care is avoided, and that psychological support is provided when needed.\n\n**At points of entry**\n\nStates Parties are recommended to encourage authorities, health and care workers and community groups to provide travellers with relevant information to protect themselves and others before, during and after travel to events or gatherings where mpox may present a risk.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restrictions for travel to and trade with these countries, or any other mpox-affected country.\n\n### Further information\n\n**Situation Reports**\n\nMpox situation reports can be found in the following link: [WHO - Emergency situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/situation-reports)\n\nThe [latest situation report](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report-35--12-august-2024) published provides details on the latest epidemiological trends, including an update on the geographic expansion of mpox in the WHO African Region from July – August 2024.\n\n**Disease Outbreak News**\n\nRecently published Disease Outbreak News:\n\n- [Mpox – South Africa](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON525)\n- [Mpox – Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON522)\n\n**Further Information**\n\n- First meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024: [https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2024-first-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024](https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2024-first-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024)\n- World Health Organization (2022).

    "content": "Save\n\nContents\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Background\n\nFor decades after the identification of mpox in humans in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1970, the disease was largely confined to the rural areas of Central and West Africa and thus did not garner broad attention. On August 13, 2024, mpox was declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a notice that was followed the next day by a declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization.\n\n### Methods\n\nIn this study we analyzed all mpox cases and deaths, based on clinical or laboratory diagnosis, that were reported to the Africa CDC from January 1, 2022, to October 30, 2024, to identify temporal variations, geographic distributions, and epidemiologic trends.\n\n### Results\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, to August 18, 2024, a total of 45,652 mpox cases were clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed in 12 African countries. These cases resulted in 1492 deaths (case fatality rate, 3.3%). From 2022 to 2024, weekly laboratory-confirmed mpox cases increased by a factor of 2.8 (from 176 to 489 cases), whereas all weekly reported cases (including those with a clinical diagnosis) increased by a factor of 4.3 (from 669 to 2900 cases). The DRC, which had reported approximately 88% of mpox cases in Africa in 2024, had 19,513 cases before the emergency declaration, with a case fatality rate of 3.1% — a weekly average of 591 cases as compared with 281 in 2023. In 2024, six African countries reported their first imported mpox infections, with Burundi also reporting local transmission.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe high mpox disease burden in Africa, especially in the DRC — with a rising number of cases, high case fatality rate, and high degree of spread to other previously mpox-free African countries — is cause for increased international concern. Case detection, contact tracing, public health measures, and affordable vaccines are needed to implement interventions in the DRC to reduce the risk of global spread of the virus.\n\nMpox was first identified in humans in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1970.[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r1) Since then, several other countries, especially in Africa, have had occasional individual cases or small outbreaks. In Africa, transmission has mostly been from a zoonotic source through contact with blood, body fluids, or cutaneous or mucosal lesions of infected animals,[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r2) especially rodents and primates.[3,4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r3) For decades, the disease was largely confined to the rural areas of Central and West Africa and, as a result, did not garner broad attention or concern.\n\nIn 2017, an mpox outbreak in Nigeria, after nearly 40 years without documented cases, became one of the largest recorded in Africa at that time, with more than 120 confirmed cases and several deaths.[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r5) This outbreak, which was not initially identified as a single outbreak, aroused concern about its potential spread to urban areas, where human-to-human transmission would be more likely due to higher population density and greater mobility, but cases declined within months. The sexual transmission route of this outbreak may have been underreported,[6](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r6) and this outbreak was not sufficiently prioritized until it contributed to global spread, especially in Europe and North America, in 2022, which sounded the alarm on the pandemic potential of mpox. During the first mpox declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) from July 23, 2022, to May 10, 2023, more than 100,000 cases of mpox, mostly caused by the clade II variant initially described in Nigeria, were reported.\n\nIn response to the rising number of mpox cases in Africa, the Emergency Consultative Group of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), comprising 20 African infectious diseases scientists and clinicians, reviewed the available data on mpox in Africa at their meeting on August 12, 2024, and recommended the first-ever declaration of a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS).[7](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r7) On August 14, 2024, the WHO declared its second mpox PHEIC,[8](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r8) which was preceded by its reprioritization of mpox as a neglected tropical disease with pandemic potential,[9](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r9) underscoring the importance of including the disease in pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response plans.\n\nThe current PHECS and PHEIC declarations are important primarily to drive the containment of the outbreaks in Africa and secondarily to alert countries to intensify their reporting of cases and prevention programs. In addition, the declarations are calls for global solidarity and for high-income countries to support low-income countries to control the outbreaks.\n\nSince the health-emergency declarations, the Africa CDC and the WHO have developed a joint continental preparedness-and-response plan for mpox, which calls for donor funding, vaccines, and human resources to be deployed in affected countries. By September 10, 2024, of the $600 million budget for the first 6 months, just over half had been secured; of the 20.5 million vaccine doses required, 5.6 million had been allocated; and approximately 10,000 community health care workers and 72 epidemiologists had been deployed in the DRC.[10](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r10) The purpose of this analysis is to describe the changes in the epidemiology of mpox cases in Africa leading up to and after the 2024 declaration of mpox as a public health emergency in Africa and worldwide.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Data Collection\n\nTo characterize temporal trends, we analyzed all cases of mpox that were reported to the Africa CDC from January 1, 2022, to August 18, 2024, as well as for the 10 weeks after the health emergency was declared (from August 19 to October 30, 2024). Data regarding mpox cases were collected from country authorities through routine weekly reports by African Union member states. The public health agency in each country used its local legislation and regulations to obtain reports from health care professionals who had diagnosed new cases of mpox.\n\nThe type of information that was collected on each patient is country-specific because the Africa CDC did not govern the reporting of these data. However, the Africa CDC specified that each mpox case should be reported along with appropriate metadata, including the patient’s demographic information, the nature of the illness, how the diagnosis was made, and the clinical outcome.\n\nEach of the 55 member states provided their data on mpox cases to the Africa CDC regional coordinating centers, where the data were checked for completeness and accuracy. The regional centers contacted designated persons as focal points from individual countries to rectify errors, inconsistencies, and missing data. The data were then deposited into the central data repository at the Africa CDC headquarters. The data were entered into the Africa CDC event management system, which supports automated analysis of disease trends and distribution. Frequency distributions are provided as absolute counts of reported new cases, and case fatality rates were calculated as a fraction of cases during a defined period.\n\n### Technical and Logistic Support\n\nMost African countries have central laboratory capacity to perform diagnostic testing for mpox. However, because of the limited laboratory capacity at the subnational level and lack of resources for specimen transportation to central laboratories in some African countries, cases of mpox were reported on clinical grounds, regardless of whether there had been laboratory confirmation. The accuracy and completeness of the information that was collected on each patient varied according to country, but individual countries maintained a standard set of procedures for their routine reporting to the Africa CDC during the study period.\n\nThe Africa CDC provides technical and logistic support on outbreak response and laboratory surveillance to all countries with mpox outbreaks at a local laboratory or through referral to regional reference laboratories. In brief, the attending health care professionals obtained skin-lesion samples and submitted them to local public health laboratories. Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with commercially available kits was the most common laboratory test platform that was used to confirm cases during the study period. GeneXpert was used in only a few African countries. Since the data were routinely collected for surveillance and the analysis was undertaken as part of the public health response, no ethics committee review was required. The data set included no patient identifiers.\n\n## Results\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, to August 18, 2024, a total of 45,652 cases of mpox were reported from 12 African countries: Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Ivory Coast, DRC, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, and Uganda. These cases resulted in 1492 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 3.3%.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2024, weekly laboratory-confirmed mpox cases increased by a factor of 2.8 (from 176 to 489 cases), whereas all weekly reported cases (including those with a clinical diagnosis) increased by a factor of 4.3 (from 669 to 2900 cases). The 15,213 cases reported from seven African countries in 2023 was a near doubling of the 8367 cases reported from 13 countries in 2022 ( [Figure 1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#f1)). The mpox case fatality rate in Africa rose from 2.6% in 2022 to 4.4% in 2023 but declined to 2.8% in 2024.\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368/asset/407d090c-740f-4d06-af39-684914f7e600/assets/images/large/nejmoa2411368_f1.jpg)\n\nTemporal Trends of Reported Mpox Cases in Africa (January 1, 2022, to October 30, 2024).\n\nShown is the geographic distribution of mpox cases and associated deaths in Africa from January to December in 2022 and 2023 (Panel A) and cumulatively for the first 4 months, first 8 months, and first 10 months of 2024 (Panel B). In Panel B, the circle indicates the island country of Mauritius.\n\nFrom January 1, 2024, to August 18, 2024, a total of 21,786 cases of mpox leading to 607 deaths were reported from 12 African countries ( [Figure 2A](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#f2)). Because of the ongoing war in the highly affected region of the DRC, only a fraction of cases had laboratory confirmation; 14,045 of the reported cases (425 per week) in the DRC were diagnosed clinically, and 5468 (166 per week) were based on laboratory confirmation ( [Table 1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#t1) and [Table 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#t2)).

[\\*](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#t2fn1)\n\n\\*\n\nIn 2024, the period from January 1 to August 18 (33 weeks) was designated as being before the declaration of the mpox emergency; the period from August 19 to October 30 (10 weeks) was designated as being after the declaration.\n\nWithin the African Union, the DRC has been the most affected country, with 19,513 mpox cases and 601 deaths reported from January 1, 2024, to August 18, 2024 ( [Table 1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#t1)). Mpox cases and deaths continued to rise in the DRC after the health emergency declarations in 2024, with the weekly average number of reported cases rising from 591 during the period from January 1 to August 18 to 1999 during the period from August 19 to October 30. Within the DRC, four provinces reported more than 1000 mpox cases in 2024, with Equateur reporting 5750 cases, South Kivu 3420 cases, Sankuru 1440 cases, and South Ubangi 1336 cases; the number of reported mpox deaths was highest in Equateur (310 deaths) and Sankuru (60) ( [Figure 2B](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#f2)).\n\nBefore the emergency warnings, three quarters of the mpox cases reported in the DRC were from 6 of its 26 provinces — Equateur (32.3%), South Kivu (19.2%), Sankuru (8.1%), South Ubangi (7.5%), Tshopo (4.0%), and Tshuapa (3.9%). A total of 50.2% of the cases were diagnosed in male patients, and 47.7% of the cases were in children who were 15 years of age or younger. The consistency of symptom reporting was variable; when included in reports, the most common symptoms were cutaneous rash (86.9%) and fever (81.3%).\n\nIn May 2023, when the first mpox PHEIC was lifted after cases declined worldwide, the number of cases in the DRC increased. The rise in cases in the DRC in 2024 was greater than that in 2023 ( [Figure 3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#f3)). The average number of reported cases in the DRC was 281 per week in 2023, as compared with 919 cases per week in 2024 (as measured from January 1 to October 30). During that period, the DRC accounted for 77.4% of all mpox cases and 99.1% of all deaths reported in Africa.\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368/asset/4d7d1bd5-1b93-4ed2-8d93-834abb30a4d1/assets/images/large/nejmoa2411368_f3.jpg)\n\nMpox Cases Reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo Each Week from January 2022 to August 2024.\n\nShown are important events related to the mpox epidemic in the DRC. Weekly data indicating whether the cases were diagnosed clinically or confirmed by laboratory testing were available only for 2024. PHECS denotes Public Health Emergency of Continental Security, PHEIC Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and WHO World Health Organization.\n\nAlthough the first mpox PHEIC declaration involved mainly clade IIb,[11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r11) the current outbreaks in Africa are caused predominantly by clade Ib, with ongoing transmission of clade Ia in the DRC,[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r12) clade IIa in West Africa, and clade IIb continuing in a few African countries ( [Figure 2C](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#f2)).\n\n## Discussion\n\nAt the time that the first mpox public health emergency was being considered, the number of countries in Africa that were reporting mpox cases was increasing and the number of reported cases in most of these countries was rising. This trend has worsened substantially after the emergency declarations. The highest burden of mpox in Africa is in the DRC, which has reported a rising number of weekly mpox cases, averaging more than 500 clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed cases combined per week in 2024.\n\nThe recent rise in mpox cases in Africa can be attributed to multiple factors, including the discontinuation 40 years ago of smallpox vaccination campaigns, which provided cross-protection against mpox.[13](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r13) Immunity to orthopoxviruses has waned since the discontinuation of smallpox vaccination, which created a susceptible population for mpox, particularly in Africa. In the DRC, 85% of the residents (86.5 million) are younger than 40 years of age and are unvaccinated.[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r14) Although the study by Rimoin et al.[15](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r15) showed an increase in mpox incidence by a factor of 20 in the DRC between the 1980s and 2007, the recent rise suggests that other contributing factors are probably at play alongside the lack of immunity in the population, such as ongoing conflict, displacement, human rights violations, and a fragile health care system.\n\nWhen the first mpox PHEIC declaration was lifted in May 2023, the number of new cases of mpox that were caused by clade Ia were increasing in the DRC at the time that the number of clade IIb cases were declining in the rest of the world. Although clade Ia had been responsible for outbreaks of mpox in the DRC for many years, mpox cases surged in 2024 with both clade Ia and clade Ib spreading, the latter especially in the South and North Kivu provinces.[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r12) A recent genomic analysis of viral genome sequences (2018–2024) shows clade Ia outbreaks stem more from zoonotic than human transmission and that multiple clade Ia subgroups cocirculate in various DRC provinces and cities.[16](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r16)\n\nGenetic data, although limited, suggest that clade Ib probably emerged locally in September 2023 in the DRC from a nonhuman reservoir and is now spreading predominantly through sustained human transmission.[17](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r17) Genomic and epidemiologic data indicate that clade Ib is spreading through sexual transmission. The clade Ib variant contains mutations in DNA caused by the APOBEC3 family of enzymes that are indicative of human-to-human transmission.[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r12) Epidemiologic data show that sex workers constituted a large proportion of the cases from South Kivu, where clade Ib predominates.[18](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r18)\n\nCountries that neighbor the DRC reported mpox cases in 2024 caused by clade Ib; Kenya confirmed its first mpox case (clade Ib variant) in late July 2024 in a patient who had traveled from Uganda to Rwanda via Tanzania.[19,20](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r19) In August 2024, clade Ib was detected in mpox cases in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and Burundi. Burundi has since reported more than 500 cases across several districts, indicating local person-to-person transmission.[21](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r21) Imported cases of clade Ib mpox were reported in Sweden and Thailand,[22](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r22) indicating spread beyond Africa as well.\n\nDuring the 2022–2023 PHEIC, the clinical severity of clade IIb was associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in men who have sex with men[23](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r23); it is not yet known if disease severity is associated with HIV infection in clade Ib mpox infections. The global case fatality rate with clade IIb epidemics during the first mpox PHEIC in 2022 was approximately 0.03%.[24](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r24) The DRC, which accounted for most of the mpox cases in 2024, had a case fatality rate of 2.7%. The reasons for these differences are unclear; hypothesized drivers include changes in case ascertainment, transmission route, and clade-specific differences. The case fatality rate from mpox declines with age.[25](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r25) Historically, in endemic areas, cases were concentrated in young children, but clade IIb cases were largely seen in adults, driven partially by high rates among men who have sex with men. The difference in the age groups that were primarily affected by clade Ib as compared with clade IIb is likely to have contributed to the differences in case fatality rates. However, it is unlikely that age differences fully accounted for observed changes in severity.\n\nA key strength of this study is the extent of data regarding the numbers of cases and deaths, including cases that were diagnosed clinically, with laboratory confirmation, or both methods at country and province levels, despite the challenges of the war in the DRC. Data regarding laboratory-confirmed cases provide estimates with high specificity but low sensitivity, whereas data regarding clinically diagnosed cases have higher sensitivity and lower specificity. This analysis has provided estimates of both kinds of cases (individually and combined) to provide a broader picture of the mpox epidemic in Africa. However, the low proportion of laboratory-diagnosed cases and deaths limits accurate estimates of clade transmissibility and severity. Geographic comparisons are also hampered by inconsistent data collection and reporting among African countries, which affects the completeness of case data.\n\nA major weakness is the underreporting of mpox cases and deaths because of limitations in health care access, inadequate specimen transport, shortages in diagnostic kits, and service disruptions. Underreporting may also vary according to age and disease severity, because parents are more likely to seek health care for children, and severe cases — more common in children — are more likely to be reported.[25](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r25) As a result, the actual numbers of cases and deaths may be higher. The occurrence of asymptomatic cases (estimated to occur in 1.8 to 6.5% of persons with mpox infection[26](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r26)) further contributes to the underestimation and warrants the use of seroprevalence surveys. The uneven quality of reporting of some variables, such as symptoms, is a limitation being addressed through education programs for health care workers. Effective control of mpox in the DRC will require efforts to strengthen case-detection and contact-tracing systems, especially among populations at higher risk, including those with exposure to the animal–human interface and those in close contact with these groups.\n\nA long-term need is the vaccination of at-risk populations under the age of 40 years to prevent future mpox outbreaks. Because of the limited available vaccine supply, the more targeted ring-vaccination approach is a short-term option, although such a program is challenging to implement when surveillance systems are weak.[27](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r27) A ring-vaccination strategy for sexual partners must address challenges similar to those faced in human papillomavirus vaccination, including sociocultural barriers,[28,29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r28) vaccine hesitancy,[30](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r30) logistic issues, and health-system limitations.[31](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#core-collateral-r31)\n\nThe ongoing mpox outbreak in Africa, as indicated by its recent emergency declarations, is not solely an African problem; it is a global health concern that requires a coordinated international response. As seen with Ebola, Zika, and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid 19), localized diseases can quickly escalate into global crises. Equitable access to vaccines is crucial. The support of high-income countries with vaccine stockpiles to provide mpox vaccines as global solidarity with Africa will enable a successful response to the threat posed by mpox worldwide. Failure to provide such access will repeat the mistakes from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article was published on January 29, 2025, at NEJM.org.\n\nSupported by the Epidemiology and Surveillance group at the Africa CDC, which is principally funded by the African Union.\n\n[Disclosure forms](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368#ap1) provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\nWe thank all the health care workers for their reports of mpox cases, their collaboration with the Africa CDC in the collection of data, and staff members at the laboratories for their support in sharing data; the team at the Africa CDC for data curation; Nikita Devnarain, Lara Lewis, and Marothi Letsoalo for providing support for the data analysis; and Nikita Devnarain, Andrew Rambaut, Aine O’Toole, Lilith Whittles, Nuno Faria, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, and Tajudeen Raji for their editorial assistance.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nDisclosure Forms(nejmoa2411368\\_disclosures.pdf)\n\n- [Download](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2411368/suppl_file/nejmoa2411368_disclosures.pdf)\n- 664.49 KB\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLadnyj ID, Ziegler P, Kima E.

Much fieldwork and research have been done by health care and public health workers in Africa during previous human outbreaks, and their knowledge should inform our global response to the current outbreak. However, unusual clinical presentations now have potential implications for recognizing the disease. In addition, infections from _poxviridae_, such as monkeypox, have common cutaneous signs that occur early, may be related to periods of transmissibility, and can leave scarring. Therefore, dermatologists will play a key role in recognizing and diagnosing infections and educating and preparing frontline health care workers for the early detection of new cases and clusters of monkeypox.\n\n**Key words:** complex medical dermatology, dermatology, infectious disease, monkeypox, pandemic, _poxviridae_\n\n* * *\n\n## Capsule Summary.\n\n- •\nThis article reviews existing and emerging literature on monkeypox.\n\n- •\nThe current outbreak includes infections in new geographic regions, different patterns of transmission, and different prodromal symptoms and cutaneous manifestations. Therefore, dermatologists must take careful histories and add monkeypox to their differential diagnosis of vesicular and pustular rashes.\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nAlthough the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic has brought more widespread attention to zoonotic diseases, infections, and novel pathogen risks, scientists have long monitored pathogens and evaluated their risks. To predict viruses with pandemic potential, in 2021, epidemiologists and infectious disease experts ranked 887 zoonotic viruses for spillover potential or the likelihood that a virus that primarily affects animals can transmit to humans. Twelve families of viruses accounted for the 50 highest ranked viruses for spillover potential, with _poxviridae_ representing 2 of the top 50 viruses. Monkeypox virus and cowpox virus ranked 24 and 28, respectively. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib1) With the unusually widespread outbreak of monkeypox cases in humans starting in May 2022, a renewed, more thorough, and widespread shift in attention to this family of viruses may be warranted. Much fieldwork and research have been done by health care and public health workers in Africa during previous human outbreaks, and their knowledge should inform our global response to the current international outbreak. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, infections from _poxviridae_ have common cutaneous signs that occur early in disease progression, may be related to periods of transmissibility, and can leave scarring. Dermatologists will play a key role in recognizing and diagnosing infections and educating and preparing frontline health care workers to detect new cases and clusters of monkeypox early.\n\n### Monkeypox history\n\nIn 1958, captive colonies of cynomolgus monkeys transported from Africa and kept in Copenhagen developed a vesicular rash determined to be an orthopoxvirus similar to but distinct from smallpox. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib2) Despite first being discovered in captive monkeys, the name is a misnomer in that it was subsequently documented in diverse mammals such as squirrels, rats, mice, and prairie dogs, and small forest mammals are thought to be the primary driver of zoonotic transmission. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4) The first case of monkeypox in humans was described in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970, and since then, cases have been reported primarily in central and western African countries, with the majority of infections having occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib2) In 2003, 47 cases were identified in the United States across 6 states in the Midwest and represented the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa. Infected people became ill after having contact with pet prairie dogs that were exposed to sick, small mammals from Ghana. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib6) Other cases outside of Africa have been described in Israel, Singapore, the UK, and the United States, but cases in and out of Africa typically occurred as single cases or clusters of 2 to 7 cases. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib2), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) Although there have been larger, more persistent human outbreaks, the most recent being over 80 cases in 2017 to 2018 in Nigeria, the current is the first to become internationally widespread with multiple foci and evidence for widespread human-to-human transmission beyond close family members. From the 2017 to 2018 outbreak, researchers constructed a phylogenetic tree from 29 monkeypox virus isolates and 23 other orthopoxvirus isolates and determined that there are 2 clades of monkeypox virus, the West African clade and the Congo Basin clade, with the West African clade thought to be less virulent than the Congo Basin clade, and associated with case fatality rates in the range of 1% to 3% compared with the Congo Basin clade around 10%. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4)\n\nAlthough the mode of zoonotic transmission of monkeypox to humans is unknown, contact with small forest animals is presumed responsible for most monkeypox infections in humans. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib2) A study conducted after the 2003 US outbreak indicated that the 47 human cases primarily resulted from touching a sick animal, being bitten or scratched with a break in the skin, cleaning the cage, or touching the bedding of a sick animal, although some infected individuals reported merely being in the same room as an infected animal. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib6), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib7) As with related smallpox virus, transmission between people is thought to occur primarily through contact with infected bodily fluids and large respiratory droplets, [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib8) although aerosol transmission between infected animals has been demonstrated. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3) Additionally, emerging reports suggest that the monkeypox virus may be found in semen and other body fluids, [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib9) although the role of seminal fluid in the transmission of the monkeypox virus is still being explored. Contagiosity, if any, from presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers is unknown. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) Anecdotal reports from frontline providers shared on social media also suggest that patients may experience few or no prodromal symptoms, which may play a role in allowing more widespread infection via asymptomatic hosts. [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib10)\n\n### Diagnosis, disease progression, and prognosis\n\nAfter an incubation period of 4 to 21 days, averaging 7 to 14 days, illness often begins with anonspecific prodrome, including 1 to 5 days of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, sore throat, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) Typically, within 1 to 5 days from the onset of fever, a rash evolves and resolves over a 2 to 4 week period of time. First, the rash appears as macules (1-2 days), then develops into papules (1-2 days), followed by vesicles (1-2 days), and ultimately pea-sized, hard pustules (5-7 days) before crusting, scabbing, and eventually falling off (7-14 days). [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) Once the eschar has fallen off and the wounds have healed with a fresh layer of skin, the patient is no longer considered infectious, about 2 to 4 weeks from the first lesion. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) Of the 47 infected individuals in the 2003 US outbreak, all had respiratory and systemic symptoms, with 39 (83.0%) having >4 respiratory symptoms and 30 (63.%) having >4 systemic symptoms; ultimately, 14 (31.1%) required hospitalization. [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib6) Photographs shared on social media and in early publications from the current outbreak also demonstrate larger, almost crateriform vesicles that may erode and lead to crusted erosions. Lesions tend to show the same stage of evolution on each body part. Lesions often first appear in the mucosa (mouth and genitals) and/or face, then appear on the hands and feet, followed lastly by the trunk. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5)\n\nBased on clinical symptoms alone, a probable monkeypox diagnosis can be made with high sensitivity (93%-98%) and low specificity (9%-26%), as previously demonstrated with a cohort of 645 individuals. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4) Reports from the current outbreak suggest that the classic prodrome may be less severe, and the characteristic vesicular lesions may be present in the genital and perineal region more frequently and potentially limited to solely that anatomic site. [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib10), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib12) This may make the detection of cases more challenging, and monkeypox should be in the differential diagnosis for new genital lesions and evaluation for potential sexually transmitted infections. Although the main clinical differential diagnosis is smallpox, important clinical differences help differentiate monkeypox. Namely, the presence of lymphadenopathy and crop-like, less-centrifugally distributed lesions may indicate monkeypox. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4) Other differential diagnoses include rashes with vesiculopustular presentation ( [Table I](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#tbl1)\n). However, herpes infections, including both herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus, tend to have smaller individual lesions and more frequently occur in limited anatomic areas (eg, 1 site or 1 dermatome for shingles). Widespread primary varicella-zoster virus or disseminated reactivation varicella-zoster virus can be challenging to distinguish clinically, but herpes-family infections may reliably be diagnosed by rapid polymerase chain reaction testing. Histologically, monkeypox is similar to vaccinia and cowpox, although markedly different from other pox viruses. Namely, these orthopoxviruses demonstrate proliferation of basal keratinocytes, necrosis of the epidermis with spongiosis, keratinocyte pallor, and dense inflammatory cell infiltration. [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib13) This also highlights the utility of genetic testing by polymerase chain reaction and immunologic testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in confirming monkeypox diagnosis.\n\n#### Table I.\n\nClinically differentiating monkeypox from varicella\n\n| Clinical feature | Monkeypox | Varicella |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lesion anatomic sites | Mucosal tissues (mouth, genitals, and anus); entire body surface favoring face and extremities | Primary: scattered, widespread<br>Reactivation: dermatomal |\n| Lesion distribution pattern | Centrifugal, primarily with body regions at the same stage of disease progression; possibly local to the anogenital region in some cases | Primary: disseminated individual vesicles, which appear in crops/clusters, with lesions in different stages present at the same time<br>Reactivation: dermatomal clusters |\n| Lesion appearance | Early: large crateriform or umbilicated vesicles<br>Late: pustules rupture and crust and leave hypopigmented scarring | Early: vesicles like a dewdrop on a rose petal<br>Late: vesicles ooze and crust |\n| Illness progression | Prodrome: 1-5 d<br>Macules: 1-2 d<br>Papules: 1-2 d<br>Vesicles: 1-2 d<br>Pustules: 5-7 d<br>Scabs: 7-14 d | Primary:<br>Prodrome: 1 d<br>Vesicles: 1-4 d<br>Crusting/Scabbing: 5-7 d<br>Reactivation:<br>Neuropathic pain and vesicular eruption with the similar time course |\n| Systemic symptoms | Very common: lymphadenopathy, fever, sweats, chills, muscle ache, back pain, headache, and abdominal pain<br>Common: respiratory symptoms (wheezing, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and respiratory distress)<br>Less Common: gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib6) | Primary:<br>Fever, malaise, and sore throat<br>Reactivation:<br>Pain at site<br>Other symptoms are uncommon but can include headache, fever, and fatigue |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/table/tbl1/)\n\nThe case fatality rate from monkeypox has been reported as 1% to 11% in the general population, although higher in young children and those with certain underlying immunodeficiency conditions. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) Early genetic data suggest that the ongoing outbreak appears related to the West African clade and therefore is expected to have a lower case fatality rate. [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib14) Notably, even these mortality numbers may be overestimated, as in the 2003 US outbreak in which there were no deaths, [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib6) and improved supportive care may lead to reduced mortality. Beyond mortality, monkeypox infection is associated with significant morbidity and potential long-term sequelae. Complications include secondary infections, pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, and corneal infection. Even in the absence of secondary bacterial infection, cutaneous and corneal scarring can occur, the latter of which can result in loss of vision. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5), [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib13)\n\n### Vaccination and treatments\n\nPrimary treatments are supportive, although early identified close contacts may benefit from ring vaccination, either with the vaccinia vaccine (replication-competent vaccine, approved for smallpox) or the newer Jynneos’ Imvamune (replication-deficient vaccine, approved for monkeypox). Because the incubation period of monkeypox is long, early vaccine administration may help decrease symptoms or even prevent the disease. [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) However, the replication-competent vaccinia vaccine has a considerable adverse event profile, including 74 complications and 1 death per 1 million primary vaccinations as per the 1968 vaccination campaign in the United States. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3) There are many contraindications to vaccination by vaccinia vaccine, including serious allergy, immunocompromised status, pregnancy or breastfeeding, underlying heart disease, or a history of atopic dermatitis or another exfoliative skin condition. [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib15) In the case of individuals with a history of atopic dermatitis, a rare and potentially lethal complication known as eczema vaccinatum can occur with vaccination by replication-competent vaccinia vaccine. [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib15) More recently, the US Department of Defense vaccinated 540,824 military personnel with an updated replication-competent vaccinia vaccine; 1 in 8000 developed myopericarditis. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib3) In contrast, the nonreplicating Jynneos vaccine is expected to have much lower rates of adverse events though large-scale trials have not yet been conducted. [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib15)\n\nOther potential treatments include tecovirimat, an antiviral medication approved for the treatment of human smallpox in adults and certain pediatric patients, and extended via Expanded Access Investigational New Drug Protocol (EA-IND) for treatment of nonvariola orthopoxviruses like monkeypox during an outbreak; cidofovir, an antiviral medication approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS, and extended through EA-IND for treatment of orthopoxes during the outbreak; Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous for the treatment of vaccinia vaccination complications, and expanded by EA-IND for treatment of orthopoxviruses during an outbreak; and brincidofovir, antiviral medication for the treatment of human smallpox viruses in both pediatric and adult patients, and currently being evaluated for EA-IND for use in treatment for monkeypox. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5)\n\n### Infection control and public health guidelines\n\nPatients diagnosed with monkeypox or exposed to an infected person or animal should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state/local public health guidelines regarding isolation and symptom monitoring. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that health care professionals caring for known or suspected monkeypox cases don gowns, gloves, eye protection, and a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved respirator with N95 filters or higher. [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib5) One should be especially mindful of activities that could resuspend dried material from lesions, such as the use of fans and sweeping. Dried material from smallpox lesions can remain infectious for many years, [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib16) although it is unknown if this is true for monkeypox. While Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not yet made recommendations regarding domesticated animals as potential sources of infection, on May 23, 2022, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recommended that pet rodents such as mice, rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs exposed to confirmed cases of human monkeypox should “ideally be isolated in monitored facilities, complying with respiratory isolation (eg, a laboratory) and animal welfare conditions (eg, government facilities, kennels, or animal welfare organizations), and tested (by polymerase chain reaction) for exposure before quarantine ends. Euthanasia should only be a last resort reserved for situations where testing and/or isolation are not feasible.” [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib17) Other mammalian pets exposed to monkeypox should be isolated at home when possible.\n\n### Conclusions and commentary\n\nFortunately, and in contrast with SARS-CoV-2, monkeypox is not a novel pathogen and has been markedly less transmissible. However, it is important to act quickly to halt community transmission and avoid the establishment of additional animal reservoirs, potentially leading to further outbreaks. If we hope to contain monkeypox while minimizing unintentional harm, we must acknowledge and act upon several key features.\n\nFirst, early identification of monkeypox cases allows public health officials to identify contacts, evaluate their risk of exposure, isolate as appropriate, monitor for symptoms, and potentially implement ring vaccination. Dermatologists should add monkeypox to their differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with new papulovesicular or vesiculopustular lesions. Patients should be queried for exposure history, and public health systems engaged rapidly if the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed. [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib18) To support this, governmental resources informed by public health authorities should focus on providing financial support to those quarantined because of monkeypox or exposure, particularly to account for the pathogen’s extensive incubation and infectious periods.\n\nSecond, the observation that most cases in the current outbreak have occurred among men who have sex with men can most likely be explained by an early cluster. More specifically, this outbreak was likely seeded by “highly interconnected sexual networks within the men who have sex with men community, where it can spread in ways that it cannot in the general population.” [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib19) There may also be some degree of ascertainment bias because of high rates of health-seeking and experience with routine evaluations for sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men, so cases among other populations may not yet be accurately captured. [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib19) Along these lines, David Heymann, MD and former director of emergencies for the World Health Organization, recently said, “We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission.” [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib20) So far, Dr Heymann’s statement has evolved into headlines such as: “Expert: Monkeypox likely spread by sex at 2 raves in Europe;” [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib20) “Monkeypox outbreak is primarily spreading through sex, World Health Organization officials say;” [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib21) and “Monkeypox outbreak may be blamed on sex at European raves, World Health Organization expert says.” [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9528236/#bib22) These headlines help demonstrate that health officials and reporters alike must be intentional in their speech and that we must balance messaging regarding possible risks of certain communities while avoiding stigmatization.\n\nWith only 3000 cases internationally, it may seem premature to sound alarms about monkeypox. However, in a world still combating another pandemic, we are acutely aware that early intervention and rapid containment are keys to controlling the spread at the community level. Therefore, as monkeypox emerges and spreads in multiple countries, we should all be alert and act quickly to contain it. Furthermore, we should recall that we are all one interconnected species and refocus research and support on neglected diseases.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDrs Rosenbach and Freeman serve _Pro Bono_ on the Ad Hoc Task Force to Develop Monkeypox Content for the American Academy of Dermatology.

However, the world has seen nothing like the outbreak we are now seeing internationally.\n\nThe current number of confirmed cases in the past four months according to Our World in Data is 23 times more than all cases recorded for the roughly five decades from 1970 to 2018 (~1,475).\n\nHistorically, outbreaks of monkeypox have been linked to animal-to-human transmission, and we have not seen long chains of human-to-human transmission, whereas for this current outbreak we are seeing extensive human-to-human transmission, causing both the number of cases and the geographic spread (80+ countries) to be unique.\n\n![Source: Sklenovská N, Van Ranst M.

Now things are looking very different. Monkeypox cases are continuing to increase daily, with almost a thousand new cases reported worldwide on average every day.\n\n![Source: Edouard Mathieu, Fiona Spooner, Saloni Dattani, Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2022) – \"Monkeypox\".

While the number of countries reporting cases has grown from a handful to over 80 in the last eight weeks, the majority of new cases remain contained to five countries.\n\n![Source: https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.html](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/vaccineswork/2022/Thumbnail/Monkeypox_Chart-3_h2.jpg)**Source:** [https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.html](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.html)\n\nOne distinctive aspect of the current monkeypox outbreak is who is being infected and the mode of transmission. The chart below shows some of the current realities of this outbreak – cases are mostly presenting in middle-aged men (98-99%) and typically through sexual contact (95%), but not all.\n\nMonkeypox is not considered a sexually-transmitted infection. The virus typically spreads to anyone through close personal contact, often skin-to-skin contact, including direct contact with respiratory secretions, such as mucus or saliva, or skin lesions. However in this monkeypox outbreak, contact during sex is the predominant mode of transmission.\n\n#### Have you read?\n\n- [Monkeypox in DRC: Sankuru health authority calls for help](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/monkeypox-drc-sankuru-health-authority-calls-help \"Monkeypox in DRC: Sankuru health authority calls for help\")\n- [How African scientific sleuths spotted the signs that monkeypox could become a global problem](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-african-scientific-sleuths-spotted-signs-monkeypox-could-become-global-problem \"How African scientific sleuths spotted the signs that monkeypox could become a global problem\")\n- [What’s in a name?

Why giving monkeypox a new one is a good idea\")\n\nAlso, the R0, or the reproduction number, for men who have sex with men is above 1 in countries with more than 1,000 cases. This means each confirmed case within a high-risk population will currently spread to more than one other person on average.\n\n[WHO reported](https://www.who.int/news/item/23-07-2022-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-(ihr)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox) that in Spain’s urban centres the estimated R0 is 1.8, in the United Kingdom 1.6, and in Portugal 1.4. The proportion of persons with monkeypox in Europe that are immunosuppressed is very high – 38-40% of positive cases are also HIV+.  Most cases in Europe are not severe (94%) and only 5-6% of those infected need to be hospitalised.\n\n![Source: https://monkeypoxreport.ecdc.europa.eu/ https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/vaccineswork/2022/Thumbnail/Monkeypox_Chart-4_2_h2.jpg)**Source:** [https://monkeypoxreport.ecdc.europa.eu/](https://monkeypoxreport.ecdc.europa.eu/)\n\n[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2207323)\n\nAs with past outbreaks, this outbreak will come to an end only if R0 drops below one everywhere. This will require control measures such as vaccination, isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, use of personal protective equipment and changes in the behaviours leading to the transmission of monkeypox.\n\nThe good news is that there are vaccines developed for smallpox that are still produced to supply national stockpiles for biosecurity. These vaccines have subsequently been licensed for monkeypox based on animal studies. However, the current demand far surpasses the globally available supply.\n\nBut the race for monkeypox vaccine access is well underway and strategies for dose sharing and eligibility for vaccines are being rolled out in countries that have access. While the US, Britain, Canada and other countries have bought millions of vaccines, none have gone to Africa. Here a more severe version of monkeypox (Congo Basin Clade) is suspected to have caused more than 70 deaths in 2022 according to  [health officials](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01686-z) ( [official WHO figures](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox--external-situation-report--3---10-august-2022) report seven confirmed deaths).
