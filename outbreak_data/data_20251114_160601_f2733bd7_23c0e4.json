When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their first dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating.\nWHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate.\n\n\n### Description of the situation\n\nFrom 1 January to 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, were confirmed in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the 205 cases of measles reported in the same period in 2024. The cases have been reported from six countries: Argentina (n= 21 cases), Belize (n= 2 cases), Brazil (n= 5 cases), Canada \\[1\\] (n=1069 cases), Mexico \\[2\\] (n= 421 cases including one death), and the United States of America \\[3\\] (n=800 cases, including two deaths).\n\n**Figure 1: Epidemic curve showing confirmed cases of measles in the Regions of the Americas, by week 1 January- 18 April 2025 (n = 2318)**\n\n[![Measles PAHO Epi curve](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/measles-paho-epi-curve.jpg?sfvrsn=d8d9617d_3)](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/measles-paho-epi-curve.jpg?sfvrsn=d8d9617d_3 \"Measles PAHO Epi curve\")\n\n**Figure 2: Geographical distribution of the confirmed cases between 1 January- 18 April 2025**\n\n[![Map measles PAHO](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/map-measles-paho.png?sfvrsn=44229178_3)](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/map-measles-paho.png?sfvrsn=44229178_3 \"Map measles PAHO\")\n\n**Overview by countries**\n\n**Argentina**\n\nBetween 1 January and 16 April 2025, Argentina reported 21 confirmed cases of measles; 10 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and 11 in Buenos Aires Province. Of these, three cases were imported, 13 were identified as contacts linked to the imported cases, and five cases are still under investigation to determine their epidemiological link to the transmission chain.\n\nThe index case was reported on 31 January 2025, in a child with a history of international travel. The second case, another child and a contact of the index case, was reported on 3 February 2025. Neither of the two cases had a history of measles vaccination, and both were laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR. Following these initial cases, 19 additional cases were confirmed up to 16 April, with ages ranging from 5 months to 40 years. Two of these cases had a documented history of international travel. Only two cases required hospitalization due to pneumonia; the remaining cases were managed on an outpatient basis and are recovering well. Twelve of the cases were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory of INEI-ANLIS \"Carlos G. Malbrán,\" with genotype B3 identified. One of the imported cases, associated with recent international travel to Thailand, was identified as genotype D8.\n\n**Belize**\n\nOn 12 April 2025, the Belize Ministry of Health & Wellness confirmed two positive measles cases—Belize’s first since 1991. The cases involved 17-year-old males from the Corozal and Cayo districts with no vaccination history, who travelled to Chihuahua, México, from 5 January to 31 March 2025 to attend a religious gathering. The onset of symptoms occurred on 2 April and 3 April 2025. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both cases and confirmed positive for measles on 12 April 2025. Thirteen close contacts who attended the religious gathering in Chihuahua were interviewed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) team and monitored daily for signs and symptoms. Despite significant efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Belize remains below the target range of 92-95%.  In 2024, Belize reported a country percentage of 83.9% for the second dose of the MMR vaccine.\n\n**Brazil**\n\nBetween 1 January and 18 April 2025, Brazil reported five confirmed cases of measles across four locations: Federal District (1), Rio de Janeiro (2), Rio Grande do Sul (1), and São Paulo (1). The two cases in Rio de Janeiro are children under one year of age, both without a history of vaccination. The onset of symptoms was on 28 February and 2 March, 2025. The cases in the Federal District (symptom onset 1 March 2025) and Rio Grande do Sul (symptom onset 6 April 2025) are adults with a history of international travel. Additionally, an adult case reported in São Paulo who has a history of vaccination, and no history of international travel was reported with symptom onset on 4 April 2025. The source of infection for this case is currently under investigation.\n\n**Canada**\n\nBetween 1 January and 12 April 2025, Canada reported 1069 confirmed and probable cases of measles from seven provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. These far exceed the 177 confirmed and probable cases reported in 2024, representing the highest annual case count since the country achieved measles elimination in 1998.\n\nThe majority (83%) of the cases reported in 2025 are linked to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak occurring among unvaccinated individuals in under-vaccinated communities that sometimes interact with one another.  Between 27 October 2024 and 12 April 2025, 971 cases have been reported in seven provinces. The outbreak was initiated by an internationally imported case that attended a large gathering in New Brunswick in October 2024, which included attendees from multiple provinces. Most cases associated with this outbreak are either unvaccinated (84%) or have unknown vaccination status (12%). To date, only a small number of outbreak-associated cases have occurred outside the initially affected under-vaccinated communities, with no evidence of significant further spread beyond these communities.\n\nAdditionally, between 1 January and 12 April 2025, small numbers of localized outbreaks have been reported, consisting of two or more epidemiologically and/or virologically linked cases. These outbreaks are distinct from the multi-jurisdictional outbreak described above and have been directly related to internationally imported cases. During this same period, 16 measles cases in Canada have been attributed to international travel.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nBetween 1 January and 16 April 2025, Mexico confirmed 421 measles cases: two imported, 35 import-related, and 384 under investigation. Cases were reported in Campeche (n= 4), Chihuahua (n= 403, including one death), Oaxaca (n= 4), Querétaro (n= 1), Sinaloa (n= 1), Sonora (n= 5), Tamaulipas (n= 2) and Zacatecas (n= 1).\n\nThe first confirmed case is an unvaccinated child in Oaxaca with a history of international travel between October 2024 and January 2025. The child arrived in Mexico on 29 January and developed symptoms on 10 February. On 14 February, the Oaxaca State Public Health Laboratory reported positive RT-PCR and IgM results for measles with genotype B3 identified. Three related cases were later confirmed.\n\nOn 20 February, the second confirmed case was reported in the State of Chihuahua in an unvaccinated child. The onset of symptoms was on 11 February, and measles was confirmed by the Chihuahua State Public Health Laboratory with positive RT-PCR and IgM results. The identified genotype was D8.  Following contact tracing and active case searches, 419 additional cases were identified.\n\nThe majority of cases were among those aged 25–44 years, accounting for 34.4% (n= 145), followed by children aged 5–9 years (13,5%, n= 57). In terms of vaccination history, 92.4% (n= 389) had no vaccination history, while 3.8% (n=16) had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, and another 3.8% (n=16) had received two doses.\n\n**United States of America**\n\nAs of 17 April 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported by 25 jurisdictions: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, New York City, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas (including two confirmed deaths), Vermont, and Washington. Of the total cases, 93% (n= 751) are associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more cases), with ten outbreaks identified so far this year. The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma accounts for 82% of the reported cases.\n\nChildren under the age of five accounted for 31% (n=249) of cases, individuals aged 5–19 for 38% (n=304), adults over 20 for 29% (n=231), and age was unknown for 2 % (n=16). The vast majority (96%) of the cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 1% had a single dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had received two doses. Hospitalization was required in 11% of total cases (n=85 of 800). Among children under five, 19% (47 of 249) required hospitalization. MMR vaccination coverage in children has decreased in recent years from 95.2% in 2019-2020 to 92.7% in 2023-2024.\n\n### Epidemiology\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious acute viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. The disease is airborne, transmitted through the air or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.\n\nInitial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, rash usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash appears 2-4 days after the onset of fever and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious about four days before and up to four days after the rash appears. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most people recover within 2-3 weeks.\n\nMeasles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur approximately in about one in every 1000 infected persons. Measles also produces immune amnesia; a pathological process that makes the immune system forget how to protect against infections and leaves the infected individual more vulnerable to other infections.\n\nThe measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines available. A two-dose schedule is 97% effective in preventing measles for life.\n\nFollowing the declaration of measles elimination in the Americas Region in 2016, there was an unusual and consistent increase in confirmed cases of the disease from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, the region recorded its highest incidence rate at 21.5 cases per million population. This increase was largely due to large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil, which led to the reestablishment of endemic measles transmission and the loss of elimination status in these countries.  Between 2018 and 2023, the Americas Region reported 49 187 confirmed cases in 18 countries, resulting from the importation of viruses from other regions of the world and the resurgence of endemic transmission in Venezuela and Brazil.  The last endemic case of measles in the Americas Region was reported by Brazil in June 2022. By 2024, 465 confirmed cases were registered, all either imported or related to importation. That same year, the elimination of the endemic disease in the Americas Region was reverified.\n\n### Public health response\n\nRegional and National Public Health Authorities in the Americas Region are implementing public health measures to control the outbreak, and WHO is providing support by:\n\n- Issuing epidemiological alerts and updates due to the increase in measles cases in several countries in the WHO Region of the Americas that started in 2024.\n- Issuing the Public Health Risk Assessment related to measles in the region of the Americas, classified the risk as \"High\", especially in countries with low vaccination coverage.\n- Continuing to monitor the situation and work closely with countries in the Region of the Americas to support their vaccination, surveillance and rapid outbreak response efforts to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles and to protect the health of the entire population.\n- Providing technical assistance and follow-up with laboratories in\n\ncountries that have had cases/outbreaks.\n- Strengthening countries’ rapid response capacities by 1) training healthcare workers in rapid response to outbreaks, using hybrid workshops and virtual courses; 2) providing financial funds for international consultants’ deployment in the most affected areas in LAC; 3) having virtual follow-up meetings with countries.\n- Promoting mass follow-up vaccination campaigns in\n\ncountries with highly susceptible populations to rapidly reduce the risk of the reintroduction of endemic measles and rubella in the countries of the Region.\n- Enhancing risk communication and community engagement in countries where outbreaks have occurred, to reinforce their commitment to immunization and recommended actions.\n\n### WHO risk assessment\n\nIn the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2025, there is an 11-fold increase in the number of cases compared to the same period in 2024. Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of two suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.\n\nDifficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases. Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.\n\n**The overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high due to several factors:**\n\n- Ongoing virus circulation from imported cases has led to outbreaks with extended transmission chains, secondary cases, and virus spread to new areas and countries in 2025.\n- Suboptimal vaccination coverage persists across the region. In 2023, only 28.6% of countries achieved over 95% coverage for the first MMR dose (MMR1), and just 16.7% for the second dose (MMR2). Regional coverage was 87% for MMR1 and 76% for MMR2. Data for 2024 is still being consolidated.\n- An increasing number of susceptible individuals due to continued low coverage, driven by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and limited access to healthcare, especially among vulnerable groups such as migrants, displaced persons, and Indigenous populations.\n\nThe overall risk of this event in the WHO Region of the Americas, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage, is classified as high with a high confidence level based on available information.\n\nThe overall risk at the global level is assessed as moderate due to the ongoing transmission in all the other WHO Regions, where immunization programs in several countries are not at an optimal level due to various factors, such as resource limitations, vaccine hesitancy, political instability, and health system weaknesses. These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread.\n\n### WHO advice\n\nWHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.\n\nWHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and rapid response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.\n\nWHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up to date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths (6 million deaths in the Americas) and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.\n\nWHO recommends maintaining a stock of the MR and/or MMR vaccines, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.\n\nWHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure. Unvaccinated individuals from areas experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.\n\n### Further information\n\n- [World Health Organization.

Measles in the United States: the current situation\n\nAs of April 24, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 884 measles cases in the United States; there are 11 outbreaks (defined as having three or more related cases) spread across 29 states \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib1)\\]. Among these, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania are leading. Texas predominates with 646 cases, followed by New Mexico with 65 \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib3)\\]. Most significantly, the outbreak is concentrated along the Western Texas–Southern New Mexico border \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib4)\\]. This cluster of counties holds 92.6 % of cases in Texas and all but one case in New Mexico \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib3)\\]. Furthermore, Gaines County, Texas, alone hosts 393 cases - more than any state in the country. This cluster contributes the majority of cases in the US this year and all three deaths. The first two deaths took place in Lubbock, with both children being from Gaines County and one from the Mennonite community; the third was an adult in Lea County \\[ [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib5), [\\[6\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib6), [\\[7\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib7)\\]. Importantly, all three individuals were unvaccinated \\[ [\\[8\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib8), [\\[9\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib9), [\\[10\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib10)\\].\n\nThese rates of measles seen so far in 2025 are unprecedented since the elimination of measles in the United States in 2000. Throughout this 25-year period, cases only rose to significant levels on two other occasions: 667 in 2014 (the “Disneyland Outbreak”) and 1274 in 2019 (centered in communities of Orthodox Jews in New York) \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib1)\\]. This is especially concerning since 2019 levels have almost been surpassed in only the first quarter of this year. The US does not stand alone in these trends, as it appears measles is growing throughout the globe. In Europe, cases are currently the highest they have been in 25 years with particular concern in Romania and Kazakhstan \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib12)\\]. For the year 2024, a total of 35 212 measles cases were reported across the EU/EEA, marking a notable increase (ten-fold), from the 3973 cases reported in 2023 \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib13)\\]. In Africa, the situation is equivalent and even more concerning as no country in the region has achieved elimination \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib14)\\]. While contexts differ considerably by country and region, these uniform trends are particularly concerning for global shifts in attitudes regarding vaccines \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib15)\\].\n\n## 2\\. Current risk factors for measles\n\nWhilst this rise in measles cases in the US has been portrayed in the media as an issue of immigration of non-US citizens into the country, it has been shown that there is no correlation between the share of a state's population that is foreign born and its rate of measles \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib16)\\]. The incidence of measles has become increasingly due to US-acquired cases - with most being epidemiologically or virologically linked to imported cases by US residents who have travelled to areas with high prevalence of measles \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib17)\\]. Therefore, herd immunity plays a significant role to prevent the spreading of these seeding cases; at least 95 % of the population must be immune to measles as it is a highly contagious virus.\n\nDespite decades of a good safety profile and disproven links to autism, measles vaccination rates do not reach this threshold (of 95 %) and are in fact dropping \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib18)\\]. National 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage was reported to be 92.7 % during the 2023–2024 school year \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib19)\\]. Yet, even this level of coverage is not observed in particular communities, with heterogeneous immunity observed in different populations throughout the country. Moreover, these vaccination rate estimations do not include homeschooled or some undocumented children, who are both less likely to be vaccinated \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib20), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib21)\\]. It is possible, then, that vaccination rates are lower than currently estimated. This ultimately means there are numerous pockets of individuals throughout the country at high risk of contracting measles. Indeed, the CDC reports that 97 % of all cases this year have occurred in those without evidence of vaccination coverage \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib1)\\].\n\nSignificantly, Gaines County, Texas, consistently holds the lowest reported levels of MMR vaccination in the state whilst having substantially higher numbers of cases \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib19)\\]. These low rates can be attributed to a variety of political, social, and religious factors. Notably, the county is home to a significant Old Colony Mennonite community, distinct from the Mennonite Church of America \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib22), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib23)\\]. This isolated group is considered to be under-vaccinated, however accurate rates are difficult to quantify since most children are either home-schooled or enrolled in nonaccredited private schools that do not record immunization data \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib5), [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib24), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib25)\\]. However, the situation is nuanced. While the Mennonite doctrine does not explicitly prohibit vaccinations, the Old Colony Mennonites tend to be highly conservative in their ideology \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib26)\\]. They typically live with limited access to technology and modern amenities, and firmly resist assimilation into mainstream society \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib27), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib28)\\]. This, combined with historical exclusion from earlier U.S. vaccine campaigns, contributes to skepticism towards modern medicine. Along with their isolated rural way of life, the community's strong emphasis on self-reliance distances them from access to healthcare. Interestingly, most Old Colony Mennonites speak a Low German dialect, further limiting access to healthcare \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib28)\\].\n\nThe Mennonite community in Gaines can be thought of as one example of a wider spread phenomenon. This would include the communities of the Orthodox Jews in New York and Amish in Ohio, as well as clusters of vaccine exemptions in California – all of whom are under vaccinated and have experienced outbreaks of measles in the past few years \\[ [\\[29\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib29), [\\[30\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib30), [\\[31\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib31)\\].\n\nThe drop in vaccination rates in the past five years could be attributed to the delay and pause in routine childhood vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as healthcare resources were shifted to prioritize the pandemic and parents adhered to home quarantine \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib32), [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib33)\\]. However, rates in administration of the vaccine have continued to decrease despite the end of the pandemic \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib19), [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib34), [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib35)\\]. As political and social discourse during the time of the pandemic focused heavily on the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, the conversation spilled over to include all vaccinations. Ultimately, attitudes and concerns towards vaccinations as a whole were affected \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib36)\\].\n\nThe increase in vaccine hesitancy also appears in line with changing cultural and political views in the country, with beliefs against vaccine use becoming more prevalent as right-wing ideologies grow in popularity. Far-right parties often promote individual liberty and skepticism towards scientific institutions, which lay fertile ground for vaccine distrust to thrive \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib37), [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib38)\\]. This changing political climate is also occurring worldwide and may be the reason why MMR vaccine rates are dropping on a global scale. According to the World Health Organization, rates in 2021 dropped to the lowest level in the past two decades \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib39)\\]. In 2023, this value is reported to have increased slightly but remains low at 83 % first-dose vaccination \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib40)\\]. This net drop corroborates with the rise in measles cases observed globally, further underscoring the role that the drop in vaccination rates are playing in this global resurgence.\n\nGrowing anti-immigration rhetoric seen in both conservative and liberal domains is also thought to be impacting protection against measles. Access to healthcare among undocumented immigrants is frequently limited by cost, language, knowledge of the healthcare system, and fear of deportation \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib41)\\]. As the culture of fear among undocumented individuals continues to intensify, as is occurring in 2025 in the US, larger numbers of individuals will be unable to seek healthcare and immunization \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib42)\\]. Therefore, pockets of vulnerable individuals will expand. In fact, Texas is currently home to the second greatest number of undocumented immigrants in the country. While access to vaccination is fundamentally part of the human right to health, protecting these individuals will also contribute to herd immunity and the overall greater safety of the country from vaccine-preventable diseases \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib43), [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib44)\\].\n\n## 3\\. Implications for clinicians and public health officials\n\nClinically, the risk of measles is often found in its complications. During the primary infection, complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia and encephalitis are common causes of mortality \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib45)\\]. Measles has also been shown to cause dysfunctional immunity, contributing to increased risk of secondary infections as well as reactivation of latent infections for up to two years \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib46)\\]. This immune amnesia can increase mortality even outside of the primary infection; this is particularly concerning in regions of the world with high prevalence of other severe infections. The public health risk of this virus, and therefore necessity of intervention, must thus not be underestimated \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib47)\\].\n\nWhile reasons for vaccine refusal are often complex, healthcare professionals must embrace this complexity and use evidence-based strategies to improve both attitudes towards vaccination as well as vaccination behaviors \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib48)\\]. On the frontlines of this work are primary care physicians, who are tasked with engaging in sustained dialogue with parents \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib49)\\]. Foremost, all children with accepting parents are to be routinely vaccinated at 12 and 60 months of age. If there is significant risk of exposure, an additional vaccine can be given between 6 and 12 months before beginning the routine schedule; if risk continues to increase, the second dose of vaccine can be given only 3 months following the first to achieve maximum immunity.\n\nWhile it is common practice to decline the acceptance of vaccine-refusing families into pediatric or primary care practice, there is no current evidence to show this is efficacious \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib50)\\]. Vaccine hesitancy is often interlaced with social determinants of health and various socioeconomic factors; since vaccine refusal has been shown to be a modifiable behavior, multi-visit conversations are encouraged and should involve fully understanding concerns and utilizing empathic responses \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib51), [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib52)\\]. The parents’ path from _pre-contemplation_ (not considering vaccination) to _action_ (vaccinating) must be step-wise; placing pressure on parents or exercising judgement can halt progress towards vaccination \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib53)\\]. Innovative approaches have also been developed, with success using social media platforms focused on presenting knowledge in a collaborative tone \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib48)\\].\n\nEfforts against vaccine hesitancy must also extend beyond the clinic to widespread public health efforts, particularly since religious and political factors are significantly at play \\[ [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib54)\\]. As seen in Gaines, a community's religious and cultural disposition can significantly impact health decisions and vaccine rates. Campaigns encouraging vaccination must be inclusive of the unique considerations of these groups in order to be effective; this point is emphasized by the CDC \\[ [\\[55\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib55), [\\[56\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib56), [\\[57\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib57)\\]. Forward-thinking approaches to reach these individuals are critically needed. One case for inspiration can be found in India, where healthcare workers and faith leaders co-designed a campaign which successfully improved vaccine uptake \\[ [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib58)\\].\n\nIn order to achieve protection for all children, both national and global efforts are required. This state of emergency in Gaines could have occurred in any community with enough vulnerability and hence needs to be understood as a cautionary tale. It may even be speculated that the risk of reestablishing endemic measles in the US due to this continually increasing vulnerability is now upon us \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib59)\\]. Beyond this, measles has been described as the canary in the coalmine, since outbreaks expose populations who are vulnerable to all vaccine-preventable diseases \\[ [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib60)\\]. With so many cases in the first quarter of the year, it can be extrapolated that vaccine-acquired immunity is currently at a record low.\n\n## References\n\n- 1.CDC.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

Canada lost its official measles elimination status this week; the United States could be next.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the U.S. passed a sobering milestone: the number of measles cases across the country reached its [**highest point in three decades**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000), with 1,281 cases reported — the most since the highly contagious disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. And the year was only half over. As of Nov. 4, that total had risen to [**1,681 confirmed cases**](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nTo find out where this is heading, look to Canada, which eliminated measles back in 1998. A deadly measles outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024 is still raging, with more than 5,100 cases reported since its start. On Nov. 10, 2025, the Pan American Health Organization, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional office for the Americas, [**revoked Canada's official measles-free status**](https://theconversation.com/canada-loses-its-official-measles-free-status-and-the-us-will-follow-soon-as-vaccination-rates-fall-269090).\n\nWill the U.S. be next?\n\n![U.S. map showing measles cases in 2025. source: Johns Hopkins University](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/cumulative-measles-cases-reported-in-the-united-states-in-2025-%20%282%29.png.webp?itok=KQYAWuct)\n\n## Childhood vaccination rates have been falling worldwide\n\nMeasles elimination is defined as the interruption of endemic measles virus transmission in a specific geographic area for more than 12 months. It's an epidemiological victory — but elimination can only last as long as vaccination rates remain sufficiently high.\n\nA safe and effective measles vaccine has been in use since the 1960s. But vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, and funding cuts are disrupting efforts to reach children with essential immunizations. [**Global childhood immunization rates stalled in 2023**](https://www.unicefusa.org/press/global-childhood-immunization-levels-stalled-2023-leaving-many-without-life-saving-protection), leaving 2.7 million additional children un- or under-vaccinated, compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to WHO and UNICEF data tracking immunization trends for vaccination against 14 diseases. Measles cases surged in 2023, infecting an estimated 10.3 million people worldwide, up 22 percent from the year before. That year, 107,500 people lost their lives to measles. The overwhelming majority were children under 5.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Mexico have had sustained measles outbreaks since early 2025, putting them on track to lose their measles-free status in 2026.\n\n_**Related:**_ [_**Americans Who Never Forget: Life Without Vaccines**_](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/americans-who-never-forget-life-without-vaccines)\n\n## As measles cases surge, here are five things to know:\n\n### 1\\. Measles can be deadly.\n\n[**Measles**](https://what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization/measles) kills nearly 300 people every day, approximately 12 people every hour, mostly children under 5. Even when children survive a measles infection, the virus can leave them with long-term health effects or permanent disabilities.\n\nIn some cases, severe complications can include pneumonia, severe diarrhea, blindness and encephalitis (brain swelling). It can also weaken a child’s immune system and make them more vulnerable to other infections long after recovering from measles, a phenomenon known as immunity amnesia.\n\nAny child who is unprotected from measles through immunization is at risk, with malnourished children and those under 5 most at risk.\n\n![Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their ext…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI677988.jpg.webp?itok=UeCEte8e)Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their extended family. Their cousins were infected with the measles virus during an outbreak in the region. Despite the outbreak, the cousins' parents were hesitant about vaccinating their children. With the guidance and assistance of local health workers and leaders, they realized the importance of vaccines in keeping their children safe, and  decided to allow them to be vaccinated following their recovery from the disease. © UNICEF/U.S. CDC/UNI677988/Amanda VoisardMore\n\n### 2\\. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious airborne disease. It can spread easily as infected people breath, cough or sneeze, releasing virus particles into the air and onto surfaces that can remain infectious for up to two hours. Unfortunately, those infected with the virus can start to spread measles to others even before they know they have it — four days before the characteristic measles rash appears.\n\nOnce a child is infected with measles, 90 percent of those they come into close contact with will become infected, if they are not already immune.\n\nThe measles virus does not recognize borders. Over the past five years, measles outbreaks have hit over 100 countries, including several that had previously eliminated measles altogether.\n\n### 3\\. Vaccines are the best way to stop outbreaks and protect children.\n\nMeasles vaccines are safe. Two doses of a measles-containing vaccine provide 99 percent protection from measles for life. They are the best way to prevent children from contracting measles and spreading the disease to others. No child should risk serious health complications or death by contracting measles.\n\nSince 1974, measles vaccines have saved nearly 94 million lives. They have protected more people than any other vaccine in the [**Essential Program on Immunization**](https://www.unicef.org/blog/legacy-progress-future-promise \"A legacy of progress, a future of promise\").\n\nWhile most countries now include measles vaccines in their immunization schedules, too many children are still unprotected. The story of unvaccinated children is one of inequity, poverty and underserved communities.\n\n![A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on J…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI514454%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=7WEpTkUG)A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on Jan. 26, 2024. © UNICEF/UNI514454/Elfatih\n\n### 4\\. Low vaccination coverage is contributing to measles outbreaks.\n\nBecause measles spreads so quickly, maintaining high vaccination rates across communities is critical to preventing outbreaks. Coverage of 95 percent or greater with two doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed to protect communities from measles outbreaks. All children should be vaccinated against measles.\n\nCurrently, the global coverage rate of the first dose of the measles vaccine is 83 percent, and the second dose is just 74 percent, far below the level needed for protection. This leaves room for measles to spread and puts vulnerable groups, including unvaccinated children, at higher risk.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for ending outbreaks and reducing global measles deaths.\n\n### 5\\. A switch to five-dose vials can help governments save more lives.\n\nMeasles vaccines are often purchased in ten-dose vials. Once opened, health workers only have a few hours to administer all ten doses to children. Any unused doses will expire and must be thrown away.\n\nHealth workers can sometimes be hesitant to open a new vial for only one or two children, knowing the rest of the doses will go to waste. This hesitation and fear of wastage too often leads to unopened vials, leaving children without the shots needed to protect them from measles.\n\n**A simple** [**switch from ten-dose to five-dose vials**](https://www.unicef.org/supply/switching-ten-dose-five-dose-vials-may-equal-more-children-vaccinated-measles) **can help increase measles vaccination coverage and reduce wastage.**\n\n![On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Su…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI797774.jpg.webp?itok=D5R24uC7)On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Sudan, during a six-day catch-up campaign. “This was the first vaccination campaign since the conflict ended in Al Jazirah,” said Aseel Abbas, a health officer and supervisor of the campaign. “The campaign is important because measles can affect a child’s hearing, vision, movement and development.” © UNICEF/UNI797774/AbdulmajidMore\n\n## **UNICEF’s role in combatting measles**\n\nUNICEF’s mission is to [**reach every single child with lifesaving vaccines**](https://www.unicefusa.org/what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization).\n\nEach year, UNICEF delivers around 250 million doses of measles-containing vaccines. These vaccines are essential for protecting childrenagainst measles through routine immunization programs and preventative campaigns in over 90 countries **.** The vaccines are also critical for responding to measles outbreaks, including in conflict and humanitarian settings.\n\nAs the world's largest vaccine buyer, UNICEF leverages its significant purchasing power to secure a reliable and sustainable supply of quality-assured measles-containing vaccines at affordable prices. The measles-containing vaccines are safe and cost-effective in saving children's lives.\n\nUNICEF is part of the [**Measles and Rubella Partnership**](https://measlesrubellapartnership.org/), a private-public partnership including WHO, CDC, United Nations Foundation and American Red Cross that spearheads a global push towards measles and rubella elimination and control.\n\nBy continuing to invest in and prioritize vaccines, we can ensure that no child anywhere dies of an illness we know how to prevent.\n\n_**Your contribution to UNICEF is more important than ever.**_\n\nDonate Button\n\nDONATE\n\n_**Right now, the lives of the most vulnerable children hang in the balance as conflicts and crises jeopardize the care and protection that they deserve.
