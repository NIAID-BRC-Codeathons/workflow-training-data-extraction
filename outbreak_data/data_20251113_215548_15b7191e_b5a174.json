The current review reports the latest update of Mpox cases from 25 February 2022 to 29 April 2025. It also evaluates the possible major complications in human life caused by Mpox. In early 2022, more than 40 countries reported Mpox outbreaks. As of 12 June 2024, the global case count for the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak was 97,281 confirmed cases, in 118 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 14 August 2024. Mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. The review also highlights Mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. The 2022 outbreak is also discussed in detail. The coinfection of HIV in patients infected with Mpox is also discussed. The evolving Mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. The discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against Mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. Although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering.\n\n**Keywords:** monkeypox (Mpox), pathology, complication, virus replication, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of Mpox\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nMonkeypox is a viral disease caused by the Mpox virus. According to the latest report (29 April 2025) of the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, 137,892 confirmed cases of Mpox have been reported from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2025. Out of these, 317 deaths were confirmed across 132 countries \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B1-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA with around 200 kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B2-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to 200 to 250 nm. This virus belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) and the family of _poxviridae_ \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B3-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. There are two clades of Mpox: clade I (formerly the Central African clade or the Congo Basin clade) and Clade II (formerly the West African clade). Both have a sequence similarity of about 95%. The fatality rate of clade I is three times higher than that of clade II \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B4-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox has a linear DNA genome that contains around 190 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B5-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats (ITR) \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B6-viruses-17-00753)\\]. All Mpox viruses have four ORFs in the ITR region \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B5-viruses-17-00753), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B7-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new Mpox. The ultrastructural analysis study in 2022 revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. The early mRNA and late mRNA form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. As a result, an intracellular mature virus (IMV) is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus (EMV), which is ready to infect another host cell \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B8-viruses-17-00753)\\] ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f001)). Mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the Mpox virus DNA was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in Italy and Germany in the 2022 global outbreak. Despite various studies on the Mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B9-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/a349ee514556/viruses-17-00753-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f001/)\n\nThe schematic representation of intracellular mature virus releasing in a host cell, the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) assemble and form mini nuclei in a host cell, and a large number of mitochondria are found near the mini nuclei. The replication of viral DNA occurs and forms m-RNA, which further forms viral protein, which is covered with an envelope and forms an intracellular mature virus.\n\nSince 2022, two major Mpox outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in July 2022 and again in August 2024. The initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly 100,000 cases and 200 fatalities \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B10-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. As of December 2024, this recent outbreak has seen over 55,000 reported or suspected cases and approximately 1000 deaths, primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring nations such as Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B11-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the UK, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, France, the USA, Canada, and Thailand. The details of the outbreaks of 2024 and 2022 are as follows.\n\n### 1.1. The 2024 Outbreak\n\nThe Mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the Sud Kivu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B12-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of Mpox. The genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) cytosine deaminase. This enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B13-viruses-17-00753)\\]. These genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade I variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact.\n\nGenetic changes, particularly those linked to APOBEC3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility.\n\nSince its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the DRC to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B14-viruses-17-00753), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo was the epicenter and reported 3235 Mpox infections and 19 deaths as of 11 August 2024 \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B16-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The emergence of the clade 1b Mpox in neighboring Central and East African countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. Burundi had recorded 545 Mpox alerts by 17 August 2024, and 142 were confirmed positive for the clade Ib Mpox variant. Rwanda confirmed its initial two Mpox infections on 24 July 2024, prompting the Ministry of Health to declare an outbreak on July 27. By 7 August 2024, Rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of Mpox, with no associated deaths. In Uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in June 2024, and out of those six, two were confirmed later. As of 13 August 2024, Kenya has identified 14 suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade Ib Mpox. To date, no deaths have been reported.\n\nIn August 2024, the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond Africa was confirmed for the first time \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The virus has also extended its reach to countries in East Africa, Europe, and Asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B16-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B17-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. On 22 August 2024, Thailand reported its initial Mpox case of a European man with a recent travel history to Africa \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B18-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Likewise, India’s identification of its first imported clade 1b Mpox case in Kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant.\n\nFrom November 2024 to 12 February 2025, four cases of clade Ib were detected. In the United States, the first confirmed case of clade Ib Mpox occurred in California in November 2024, following travel to an affected region. A second case was identified in Georgia on 14 January 2025, involving a traveler from a country with ongoing Mpox transmission. Subsequent cases were reported in New Hampshire on 7 February 2025 and in New York on 12 February 2025. These four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B19-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The 2024 outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA significant public health crisis unfolded between 2022 and 31 December 2024, with global records documenting over 118,777 Mpox infections \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Between 2022 and 2024, the different regions of the Americas documented 67,220 confirmed Mpox cases, resulting in 151 deaths across 31 countries and territories \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The majority of these cases occurred in 2022 (57,616, representing 85.7% of the total), followed by a substantial decline in 2023 (4056 cases, 6%). A minor increase was observed in 2024, with 5548 cases (8.3%) \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B21-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were East, Central, West, and Southern Africa, specifically, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, the Central African Republic (CAR), Ivory Coast, and South Africa \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B22-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics.\n\n### 1.2. The 2022 Outbreak\n\nBefore 2022, Mpox cases were documented within the African continent. The first case of the 2022 outbreak of the Mpox outside the African continent was recorded on 6 May 2022 in the United Kingdom \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B23-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A total of 366 Mpox cases were confirmed in the United Kingdom (UK) until 10 June 2022 \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B24-viruses-17-00753), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B25-viruses-17-00753)\\]. On 18 May 2022, Portugal reported 14 Mpox infections, Spain reported seven, and Canada reported 13. The first Mpox cases in Belgium, Sweden, and Italy were confirmed on 19 May 2022. France, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands each reported their initial Mpox cases on 20 May 2022. Switzerland and Israel each confirmed their initial Mpox cases on May 21. By 24 May 2022, 19 countries had reported cases of Mpox. Among these, the United Arab Emirates identified its first case in late May, involving a 29-year-old female traveler from West Africa. Slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. Denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the Canary Islands. In Canada, Quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on 24 May, the same day the Czech Republic confirmed its first case \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B24-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study published in the New England Journal on 21 July 2022 reported a total of 528 Mpox infections between 27 April and 24 June 2022, at 43 sites within 16 countries \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nBy 27 May 2022, Portugal had confirmed 96 Mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all 96 cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. A subset of 27 confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in Eurosurveillance in June 2022 \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B27-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The majority of cases (25 cases) of the 2022 Portugal outbreak resided in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) region, with single cases in the North and Algarve regions. All cases were male, ages ranging from 22 to 51 years (majority 30–39). Considering exposures within the 21 days preceding symptom onset, few (1/10) reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel (4/27).\n\nMost cases were identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) (18/19), while one reported sex with only women. During the 21 days before symptom onset, most cases with available data (14/16) reported multiple sexual partners. Six cases reported attending a sauna in the LVT region, one frequented a UK sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals (two with cats and one with pigs). Common symptoms included exanthema (fourteen), inguinal lymphadenopathy (fourteen), fever (thirteen), and genital ulcers (six). Fourteen cases were HIV-positive. Three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. No deaths were reported by 27 May 2022. One middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B27-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency for a previous Mpox outbreak caused by clade IIb of the virus. Almost 48 cases of Mpox were reported from different regions of Latin America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, by 28 June 2022 \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B28-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In July 2022, the multi-country Mpox outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. This declaration was lifted in May 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. The outbreak had infected 87,000 people and resulted in 140 deaths. The WHO attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B29-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 7 February 2024, the maximum number of reported cases in the USA is 31,894, followed by Brazil (10,967), Spain (7752), and France (4171).\n\nThe geographical distribution of the Mpox in countries affected in Africa is illustrated in [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f002) a, while the recent trends of Mpox cases in Africa are shown in [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f002) b.\n\n#### Figure 2.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/d209b4abd20e/viruses-17-00753-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f002/)\n\n( **a**) Shows the geographical distribution of Mpox in countries affected in Africa.

Host Reservoirs and Transmission\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease; Central African rodents and primates are the natural hosts of Mpox. The Mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B30-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Transmission can also occur via contaminated materials (fomites) like bedding or clothing. Historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent.\n\nA 2018 case study reported that a man traveling from Nigeria to the UK on September 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with Mpox. One of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had 134 contacts traced and monitored. Four of these contacts later became ill. This incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of Mpox from a traveler returning from Nigeria to healthcare staff \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B31-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nHistorically, Mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. However, the transmission pattern shifted in the 2022 outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. Over the last two years (2020–22), predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B32-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because Mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. Human-to-human transmission of the Mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B33-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe Mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B34-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The different proposed model admits that during the entry of the Mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the Mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. In the same way, when the Mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and Langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. In this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f003)).\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n[![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/fd6ca55b0628/viruses-17-00753-g003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f003/)\n\nA schematic diagram of the Mpox virus and its entry route in humans was created by biorender.com.

Complications Associated with Mpox\n\nThe various complications that have been observed in Mpox-infected persons are the following.\n\n### 3.1. Neurological and Psychiatric Complications\n\nMpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. Research conducted in Nigeria in 2020 indicated that a quarter of hospitalized Mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B35-viruses-17-00753)\\]. However, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. Neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in Mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak, with reported occurrences of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2%, respectively \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B36-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed the presence of Mpox-specific IgM antibodies. Studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in 50% of individuals with Mpox infection. Badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B36-viruses-17-00753)\\]. These symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B37-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, research conducted in Iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing Mpox outbreak \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B38-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country Mpox outbreak within the Kurdistan region of Iraq. A digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from 27 to 30 July 2022. The study included 510 participants. Overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of Mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. Statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. Gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward Mpox \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B38-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.2. Dermatological Complications\n\nA common characteristic of Mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. Skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat (macular), then raised (popular), and subsequently fluid-filled (vesicular). These lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B39-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A characteristic Mpox rash begins with small, flat (macules) or raised (papules) lesions, typically 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. These lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression (umbilication), and eventually form crusts. The vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B40-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA hallmark of Mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B41-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. However, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. Lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. The rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward (centrifugally) to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. A higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B42-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. A comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of Mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B43-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn one study of 54 patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority (94%) exhibiting anogenital involvement \\[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B44-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A large portion of these patients (89%) reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage (7%) had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. Additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue (67%) and fever (57%), while a minority (18%) showed no initial symptoms. In some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B45-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA separate international study, tracking 528 Mpox infections in 2022, also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. This study found that 73% of patients had anogenital lesions, and 41% presented with mucosal lesions. A rash was observed in 95% of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever (62%), lymphadenopathy (56%), lethargy (41%), muscle aches (31%), and headaches (27% \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\]). Due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of Mpox, especially as seen in the 2022 outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected Mpox infection.\n\nThe other study, conducted in 101 patients from thirteen countries, shows that 54% of cases have been found with skin lesions. During the initial five days of infection, papules (36%), vesicles (17%), and pustules (20%) were the most frequently observed skin lesions. From days 6–10, pustules became the dominant lesion (36%), followed by erosions/ulcers (27%) and crusts/scabs (24%). After day 11, crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B46-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nWhile monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B47-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.3. Complications Related to the Coinfection of Mpox Virus and HIV\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of Mpox. Mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The coinfection of Mpox virus and HIV was first identified and diagnosed in Latin America \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B48-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In 2022, the recent coinfection of Mpox and acute HIV was also confirmed in a 24-year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B49-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A 2023 review in _Vaccine_ reported 6345 confirmed Mpox cases across 53 studies, with a 40.32% HIV co-infection rate \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B50-viruses-17-00753)\\]. According to WHO, 51% (13,769/26,992) of confirmed cases of Mpox have HIV \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B51-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The outbreak of Mpox in multiple countries was reported during 2022–24. According to the WHO report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the European region (86%), followed by America (11%), the African region (2%), and the Eastern Mediterranean region (1%) \\[ [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B52-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Co-infection with HIV increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of HIV on genital organs (lesions) and genital secretions or by increasing both factors \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B53-viruses-17-00753), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B54-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Individuals living with HIV, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low CD4 cell counts (<500 cells per mm3), demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe Mpox complications and mortality compared to those without HIV. The immunodeficiency resulting from advanced HIV infection elevates the susceptibility to severe Mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B55-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThis study analysed 382 Mpox cases, comprising 367 cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. The median age of the participants was 35 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 30 to 43 years. At the time of Mpox diagnosis, 349 individuals (91%) were known to be living with HIV. Among those with HIV, 228 (65%) were adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in 32 participants (8%). The median CD4 cell count was 211 cells/mm3 (IQR 117–291). Specifically, 85 individuals (22%) had CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, and 94 individuals (25%) had counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3. An undetectable viral load was present in 193 participants (51%) \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B55-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nSevere Mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding 300 cells/mm3. These complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions (54% vs. 7%), pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules (29% vs. 0%), and secondary infections and sepsis (44% vs. 9%).\n\nHospitalization was required for 107 participants (28%), with 27 (25%) of those hospitalized resulting in death. All fatalities occurred in individuals with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. Within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated HIV viral loads. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to Mpox was suspected in 21 of the 85 individuals (25%) who initiated or restarted ART, with 12 (57%) of these cases resulting in death. Tecovirimat was administered to 62 participants (16%), while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants (2%). Tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases.\n\n### 3.4. Complications Associated with Heart (Myocarditis)\n\nMyocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in Mpox infection. Two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the U.S. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. They were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms (Chest pain) and elevated biomarkers. Oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. They received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels \\[ [56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B56-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a 2022 study, Thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. One of these patients had a history of HIV with a normal CD4 count \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as Coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses \\[ [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B57-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. The most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing 10 to 14 days after the viral infection. The occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines \\[ [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B58-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. Heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in Mpox infection \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B59-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.5. Hypotension Sepsis Complication\n\nIn severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. The associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. These factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. Vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement.\n\nWhile infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in Mpox-infected patients with _Streptococcus pyogenes_ \\[ [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B60-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. Treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support \\[ [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B61-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.6. Ocular Complication\n\nOcular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B3-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. The 2022 Mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, compared to 9–23% in prior outbreaks \\[ [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B62-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. Less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. In the 2022 outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. Though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, significantly lower than the 9–23% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions \\[ [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B62-viruses-17-00753), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B63-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with Mpox \\[ [64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B64-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, there are documented cases (53-year-old patient in San Francisco, CA, USA) where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions \\[ [65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B65-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nPatients presenting with ocular Mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. A slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures \\[ [66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B66-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nRetinol supplementation is advised. Supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. In cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary \\[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B67-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use \\[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B68-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management.\n\n### 3.7. Fulminant Mpox\n\nA severe, widespread, and destructive form of Mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/µL, high HIV viral loads, or hepatitis B co-infection. These cases show a resemblance to an AIDS-defining illness. Patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged \\[ [69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B69-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. Complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B70-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis \\[ [71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B71-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mortality was reported in 15% of patients, primarily those with CD4 counts below 200 cells/µL \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B70-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. Tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. Prolonged treatment may be necessary. Wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. Specialist consultation should be considered as needed. Close monitoring for complications is vital \\[ [72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B72-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.8. Complications Associated with Immune System\n\nLike COVID-19 infection, Mpox also creates cytokines inside the body \\[ [73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B73-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Cytokines are Th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins (IL-4, IL5, IL6, and IL10) are released, while TH1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. Therefore, IFγ (interferon gamma), IL2, IL12, TNF-α, and IFN-α levels decreased after Mpox infection \\[ [74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B74-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The human Mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. It downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. The nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification \\[ [75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B75-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. The intracellular protein of Mpox called Viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B33-viruses-17-00753), [76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B76-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in [Figure 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f004). The Mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons (IFNs) \\[ [77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B77-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. There are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNω are considered type I interferons. Type I interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating Janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway \\[ [78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B78-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: (a) An in vitro study in 2010 showed that Mpox viral protein B16 inhibits JAK-STAT induced by type I interferon \\[ [79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B79-viruses-17-00753)\\]. (b) Another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of D7L block interleukin (IL-18) \\[ [80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B80-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The complement control protein (CCP) of Mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense \\[ [81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B81-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Apart from it, many proteins of Mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, IL-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, SPI-1, inhibitors of MHC class I molecules, inhibitors of IRF3 NF-kB activation, Inhibitor of IRF3 and IRF7 activation, inhibitors of MHC class II, CC, and CXC chemokine binding proteins.\n\n#### Figure 4.\n\n[![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/4ace5344de38/viruses-17-00753-g004.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g004.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f004/)\n\nThe schematic diagram shows an Mpox-infected liver and testis and its evading mechanism in host cells with cytokine storm production, representing increased Th2-mediated immune response and decreased TH1-mediated immune response.\n\n## 4\\. Diagnosis of Mpox\n\nPCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of Mpox viral DNA in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. Real-time PCR is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of Mpox. In the 2022–23 outbreak of Mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: The Novaplex MPXV Assay, the STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX, the Real Cycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2, and the RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0, with an in-house PCR assay. A comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the Novaplex MPXV Assay and RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0. The RealCycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2 and STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy (97.3%) and diagnostic sensitivity (96.3%) \\[ [82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B82-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. Cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination \\[ [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B83-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques (immunofluorescence technique and ELISA), electron microscopy-based detection (TEM), radiation-based virus detection (X-ray diffraction technique and CT), nucleic acid amplification methods (NASBA, LAMP, RT-PCR), antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses (HAI), and CRISPR-CAS system-based detection \\[ [84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B84-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic \\[ [85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B85-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nCRISPR-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. According to research conducted \\[ [86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B86-viruses-17-00753)\\], a system was designed to detect the Mpox viral DNA using a fluorescence readout. In this study, it was shown that the G-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target DNA, which was labeled with fluorescein (6-FAM) on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher (BHQ-1) at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the CAS-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. This effect was not shown in the absence of the target DNA because CAS-12a is unable to cleave the labeled G-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens.\n\nPan-orthopoxvirus PCR/ESI-MS is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the T5000 platform \\[ [87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B87-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Here, A PCR method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) was employed to diagnose Mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples.\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to RT-PCR. This technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of DNA synthesis by Bst DNA polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle \\[ [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B88-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n## 5\\. Treatment of Mpox\n\nThe treatment of Mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with Mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. Other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. Vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. To prevent infection with the Mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials (e.g., clothing, bedding). Most people with Mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. Severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women.\n\n### 5.1. Vaccine Strategies Against Mpox\n\nAlmost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since April 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. Viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of Mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation.\n\nAccording to Batéjat Christophe et al., the Mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named FCS and VTM and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. This study showed that Mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °C and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °C, and there was no difference between clade I and clade II \\[ [89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B89-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe United States of America currently has three vaccines against smallpox: JYNNEOSTM, also known as IMVAMUNE, ACAM2000®, and Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) \\[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B90-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This vaccine JYNNEOSTM has been prepared from the modified Ortho poxvirus vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating.\n\nIn August 2007, the FDA approved ACAM2000® for the prevention of smallpox. The ACAM2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with JYNNEOS™. ACAM2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas JYNNEOS™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus. ACAM2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but JYNNEOS™ does not show cutaneous reactions. Under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV) can be used, but its effectiveness against Mpox is still unknown \\[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B90-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the use of the JYNNEOS™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and Mpox \\[ [91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B91-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Originally, the FDA developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series (0.5 mL per dose, administered 4 weeks apart). However, due to overwhelming demand, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on 9 August 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series (0.1 mL per dose, administered four weeks apart).\n\nIt was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted VE of 88.9% (95% CL, 56.0 to 97.2), 80.3% (95% CL, 22.9 to 95.0), and 86.9% (95% CL, 69.1 to 94.5), respectively. These vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from Mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of Mpox. These vaccines (JYNNEOS™) are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by Mpox, such as gay, bisexual, MSM, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and HIV patients \\[ [92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B92-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nHuber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from Mpox and others with MSM (men who have sex with another man), aged 18–49. A total of 309 infected patients (Mpox or MSM) were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency (VE) was 75.2% (95% confidence interval (CL) 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose (partial vaccination) of vaccine and 85.9% (95% CL, 73.8 to 92.4) in patients with full (two doses) vaccination \\[ [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B93-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nLauren Pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation Mpox vaccines (MVA-BN, LC16m8, OrthopoxVac) in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population \\[ [94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B94-viruses-17-00753)\\]. They compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. Additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses (one or two) and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). A comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. Thirty-three studies focused on third-generation Mpox vaccines, predominantly MVA-BN (32 studies). Two additional studies reanalysed existing data. The majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between May and October 2022.\n\nVaccine efficacy for a single dose of MVA-BN was estimated at 76% (95% CI: 64–88%) across twelve studies. For two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% (95% CI: 72–92%) based on six studies. Regarding post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with MVA-BN, the vaccine efficacy against Mpox was 20% (95% CI: -24–65%) from seven studies. All vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nIn terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 (55%) were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 (9%) as fair, and 12 out of 33 (36%) as good. Notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 (69%) rated as good.\n\n### 5.2. Various Therapies for the Management of Mpox\n\n#### 5.2.1. Tecovirimat\n\nTecovirimat (TPOXX, ST-246) is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but under the Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol, it can also be used to treat Mpox. In the United States or Canada, Tecovirimat is not approved for use against Mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in Europe for the treatment of Mpox \\[ [95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B95-viruses-17-00753), [96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B96-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear.\n\nTecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against Mpox and other smallpox viruses. Tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus F13L protein. This protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread. Tecovirimat functions by acting as a molecular binder, promoting the dimerization of F13L and thereby inhibiting its normal activity \\[ [97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B97-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nEarly studies have indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly shorten the duration of monkeypox skin lesions \\[ [98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B98-viruses-17-00753), [99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B99-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Initial findings from the STOMP trial, which spanned multiple countries, failed to demonstrate a notable impact of tecovirimat on the healing time of skin and mucosal lesions in individuals with mild to moderate monkeypox. Notably, in the STOMP trial, a majority of participants began tecovirimat treatment more than five days after experiencing initial symptoms \\[ [100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B100-viruses-17-00753)\\]. According to another study \\[ [101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B101-viruses-17-00753)\\], tecovirimat, which inhibits the formation of p37 (a protein that helps in the release of enveloped virus and also enhances the virulence factor), was found to be effective in treating Mpox.\n\nTecovirimat is an inhibitor of the pox virus; however, Mpox also shows resistance against many drugs in cell culture, including CMX001 and ST-246 \\[ [102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B102-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The clinical study of Mpox was done in France in 2022, where Mpox was isolated and sequenced. This study reveals that the effective concentration of tecovirimat against Mpox is in nanomolar concentrations, while cidofovir is only effective at micromolar concentrations \\[ [103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B103-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Therefore, combination therapy may be effective for the treatment of Mpox.\n\nThe efficacy of tecovirimat has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo against a clade 2 Canadian 2022 isolate of Mpox isolated during the 2022 outbreak, and it was found that tecovirimat prevented Mpox replication in vitro with an effective concentration in the nanomolar range. The efficacy of tecovirimat was also evaluated in the CAST/EiJ mouse model with the 2022 Canadian isolate. The experiments also show that tecovirimat reduced viral titers after 1–2 weeks of infection. In 2022, tecovirimat was recommended against Mpox treatment. In vitro testing has been performed against 2022 Canadian isolates of Mpox designated Mpox/SP2833. The EC50 and EC90, for TPOXX were determined against Mpox/SP2833, a clade 1 virus in Vero E6 cells is 0.008 ± 0.0014 (EC50 value (μM) ± SE) and 0.0145 ± 0.0138 (EC90 value (μM) ± SE) \\[ [104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B104-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a recent study published in the Lancet journal in 2025, the author conducted an in vitro analysis comparing the susceptibility of clades 1b and 2b to tecovirimat. The clade 1b isolate was obtained in Sweden in August 2024 from a traveler returning from Africa. For comparison, the clade 2b virus was isolated in France in June 2022 from a patient at the Institut Pasteur Medical Center. Additionally, ancestral clades 1a and 2a were included as controls, utilizing U2OS cells, known for their high sensitivity to Mpox virus infection, as target cells. The findings demonstrated that tecovirimat effectively suppressed all four viral strains, exhibiting comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 15.3 nM to 25.8 Nm \\[ [105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B105-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n#### 5.2.2. Cidofovir and Brincidofovir\n\nBrincidofovir and cidofovir are also being used as DNA polymerase inhibitors for Mpox treatment, despite not being approved by the FDA. In vitro and in vivo studies reported that both cidofovir and brincidofovir can stop the replication of Mpox \\[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B106-viruses-17-00753)\\]. When Brin cidofovir derivative (CMX001) is given to the host, the lipid part of the drug breaks down and releases cidofovir, which forms cidofovir-diphosphate after phosphorylation, which inhibits DNA polymerase \\[ [107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B107-viruses-17-00753), [108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B108-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a 2020 study, another new drug was reported, which is Nioch-14, having antiviral activity against Mpox \\[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B106-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n#### 5.2.3. Resveratrol\n\nA recent study indicated that resveratrol plays an important role in Mpox treatment. Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, pines, and berries \\[ [109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B109-viruses-17-00753), [110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B110-viruses-17-00753)\\]. It is also available in red and white wines, but a higher concentration is found in red wine. The maximum amount of resveratrol is found in Polygonum cuspidatum (524 μg/g). It is also known as Japanese knotweed, which has been extensively used for inflammatory treatments in 2012–13. Resveratrol is found in cis and trans forms, but the trans form is highly effective in anti-inflammatory activity. The antiviral effects of resveratrol have been explored in several viruses, including the Mpox virus, the influenza A virus \\[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B111-viruses-17-00753)\\] Epstein–Barr virus \\[ [112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B112-viruses-17-00753)\\], Herpes simplex virus \\[ [113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B113-viruses-17-00753)\\], HIV \\[ [114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B114-viruses-17-00753)\\], and hepatitis C virus \\[ [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B115-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nResveratrol inhibits the replication of many viruses \\[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B111-viruses-17-00753), [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B115-viruses-17-00753), [116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B116-viruses-17-00753), [117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B117-viruses-17-00753), [118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B118-viruses-17-00753), [119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B119-viruses-17-00753), [120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B120-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The antiviral mechanisms of resveratrol against various types of viruses are different. Resveratrol reduced the virus yield by more than 120-fold at a concentration of 50 mM. The effect of resveratrol against Mpox has also been examined using HeLa cells. HeLa cells were infected with two strains of Mpox virus, Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC, and it was found that resveratrol at 50 mM concentration reduced the yield of Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC Clades by 195- and 38-fold, respectively \\[ [121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B121-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nApart from these potential therapies, some other alternative treatments such as TOP1 inhibitor, chlorhexidine, and cysteine proteinase inhibitors are being explored, but more investigation is required for the effective treatment of these compounds.\n\n#### 5.2.4. Plant Metabolite as a Therapeutic Drug\n\nA recent study was conducted in 2023, in which the anti-monkeypox capability was evaluated in 56 plant products. Among these metabolites, curcumin showed the strongest binding affinity with a value of −37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin (−34.89 kcal/mol), piperine (−34.58 kcal/mol), and coumadin (−34.14 kcal/mol) \\[ [122](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B122-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study that occurred in 2022 shows various natural compounds obtained from Plantago lanceolate targeting on profilin-like protein A42R of Mpox virus \\[ [123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B123-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The A42R protein of Mpox has an amino acid sequence similarity with profilin proteins of eukaryotic cells \\[ [124](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B124-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Profilin family proteins are actin-binding proteins responsible for F-actin assembly in the actin filament and also participate in the regulation of F-actin \\[ [125](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B125-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Silico-based screening identified various important compounds, such as luteolin 7,30-diglucuronide, luteolin 7-glucuronide-30-glucoside, plantagoside, narcissoside, and others \\[ [123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B123-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis revealed that plantagoside and narcissoside were found to be more stable products that were able to bind with the binding pocket of the viral protein of the Mpox virus due to hydrophobic and hydrogen interactions.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMpox, while historically less prevalent than other orthopoxviruses, has demonstrated a significant emergence for globally, highlighting the importance of robust surveillance and preparedness. Its complications, while often self-limiting, can be severe, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. Transmission, primarily through close contact, necessitates stringent public health measures to curtail outbreaks. Accurate and timely diagnosis, facilitated by PCR testing, is crucial for effective management and containment. While specific antiviral treatments are available, their accessibility and widespread use remain limited, emphasizing the need for further research and development. Effective public health strategies, including vaccination and education, are essential in mitigating the impact of Mpox and preventing future pandemics. Continued research into the virus’s evolving epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and optimal treatment strategies is imperative to safeguard global health.\n\nThe 2019 coronavirus pandemic demonstrated that disease outbreaks extend beyond physical illness, significantly affecting mental well-being. Individuals experienced heightened fear, including anxiety about potential loss and depression linked to isolation. Healthcare workers facing direct exposure reported particularly elevated levels of fear. Parallels can be drawn with the Mpox outbreak, which has also been associated with notable economic and behavioral shifts, manifesting in increased anger, frustration, depression, and anxiety.\n\nThe health care provider also has very little knowledge regarding the treatment of Mpox, so proper guidance and care of Mpox-affected people should be done for the management of mental health issues in COVID-19-affected people, WHO issued advisories that may be implemented in Mpox cases.\n\nThe important suggestions to control mental disorders during the monkeypox outbreak are as follows: (a) Always study and gain knowledge from an authorized source, such as WHO. (b) Do not come under the influence of people who are already suffering from any mental disorder because of an outbreak. (c) Avoid drinking alcohol or smoking during an outbreak because it will only ruin your health condition. (d) Hand hygiene practices should be followed regularly. (e) Eat a well-balanced diet, and try to avoid sitting alone. Even when you are alone in the house, try to chat with your friends or family members via social media. (f) Exercise daily.\n\nThe outbreaks in 2022 across the globe have emphasized the significance of continuous and focused intensive care, along with the development of novel drugs.\n\nThe limited smallpox vaccine administration and decreasing immunity in the population can enhance virus spreading globally. Patients of Mpox have different kinds of complications, such as bacterial infection of the skin, skin scarring, permanent corneal scarring, pneumonia, dehydration, sepsis, and encephalitis. It is imperative to provide comprehensive care for patients, including education, nutritional support, hydration, and protection of sensitive organs such as the eyes and genitals. Therefore, it is important for the medical professional team, including clinicians, health experts, and nurses, to immediately identify infection in humans and animals, use protective measures, and initiate public health reporting to prevent an outbreak.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sharda University and Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) for providing valuable resources for this work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization and original draft preparation: R.Y., U.S. and S.K.; writing: R.Y., U.S., S.G., H.A.R., A.A.C., S.R. and V.K.K.; review and editing: H.A.R., A.A.C. and S.R.; supervision: S.K., V.K.K. and R.Y.

These cases were not linked to each other and there has been no additional spread.\n- The CDC has assessed the overall risk to the United States from the clade I mpox outbreak as low.\n\n## Clinical Recommendations\n\n- The [CDC recommends](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) that clinicians maintain a greater index of suspicion for mpox infection in patients who have recently traveled to the DRC or neighboring countries who present with [signs and symptoms of mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/clinical-recognition.html).\n- Symptoms can include a rash on the hands, feet, chest, face, mouth, or genital area, fever, chills, fatigue, myalgia, headache, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough.\n- The [mpox rash](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/clinical-recognition.html) commonly involves macules, papules, vesicles or pustules that are deep seated, firm or rubbery, and well circumscribed. Lesions may umbilicate or become confluent and progress over time to scabs.\n- [Ocular manifestations of mpox infection](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-care/ocular-infection.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/ocular-infection.html) can range from mild to severe and include periocular skin lesions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, and loss of vision.\n- The CDC has also asked clinicians to [document patients' experience with pain](https://www.aao.org/Assets/9a68bbfc-3640-4d6b-a36d-0a0cd640414c/637949550078200000/dear-colleague-monkeypox100-pdf?inline=1) associated with mpox infection.\n- As soon as mpox is suspected, clinicians should consult their [state health department](https://resources.cste.org/epiafterhours) or the CDC through the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770.488.7100).\n\n## Additional

But that small group makes a big difference. By giving, you're standing up for something simple but profound: that knowledge should belong to everyone.\n\n\nIf you agree, then this is your moment to give back. Even $2.75 makes a difference.

The Administration is partnering with jurisdictions holding large LGBTQI+ events over the coming weeks to increase availability of vaccines in those locations and launching a new pilot program to get more vaccines into communities where the virus is spreading, but where individuals may face barriers in accessing vaccines. The White House will set aside 10,000 vials of vaccine that health departments can request to use as part of smaller-scale equity interventions. Up to 100 vials per jurisdiction will be made available to use in up to 5 equity related interventions, including distribution from community-based clinics that may not be reached by the current vaccine supply, or distribution to communities identified locally as a priority based on the virus epidemiology.\n\nOn August 4, in response to continued transmission in the U.S. and globally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) [declared](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/08/04/biden-harris-administration-bolsters-monkeypox-response-hhs-secretary-becerra-declares-public-health-emergency.html) the monkeypox virus a Public Health Emergency (PHE). This is the first U.S. emergency declaration issued since the ongoing COVID-19 PHE declaration in 2020 and gives federal agencies the power to quickly direct resources and personnel towards the development and evaluation of vaccines and treatment, as well as other needed response efforts.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are currently over 24,572 domestic cases of monkeypox, and over 64,916 cases globally, a transmission rate that prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare monkeypox a global health emergency on July 23.\n\n#### Overview of Infection & Symptoms\n\nMonkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. The virus can be spread in various ways, including from person to person through direct contact with infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids. It also can be spread by respiratory secretions during prolonged, face-to-face contact, or during intimate physical contact.\n\nMonkeypox symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms but milder, and monkeypox is rarely fatal. The most distinctive symptom of monkeypox is a rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appear on the face and on other parts of the body. Other symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. Illness after infection typically lasts 2-4 weeks, and the infection is treatable.\n\n#### Vaccination\n\nThe United States previously stockpiled JYNNEOS, the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccine that can be used to prevent monkeypox in people who are exposed to the virus. Vaccines were initially recommended for people who have had or may have contact with someone who has monkeypox, or for healthcare and public health workers who may be exposed to the virus. However, federal health officials have since expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that currently makes up the majority of U.S. monkeypox cases.\n\nIn June, the Biden Administration [released](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-monkeypox-outbreak-response/) the first phase of its national monkeypox vaccine strategy, which was aimed at rapidly deploying vaccines in the most affected communities. Currently, there are approximately 550,000 available doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine in the [strategic national stockpile](https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx), a number that is quickly being outpaced by the number of individuals at risk for the virus given the level of community transmission. During the August 4 announcement, HHS officials indicated that they are expediting an additional 150,000 doses of JYNNEOS to arrive in September and expect to ship an additional 800,000 vaccine doses out in the coming weeks to boost supply and keep up with demand.\n\nTo date, HHS has received vaccine dosage requests from all 50 states and some local jurisdictions. The allocations are made based on review of the status of the outbreak, dosage availability and vaccine administration data from the local jurisdiction. **HHS updates the number of vaccine doses distributed to local jurisdictions each Wednesday** [**here**](https://aspr.hhs.gov/SNS/Pages/JYNNEOS-Distribution.aspx) **.**\n\n**UPDATE:** On August 9, the FDA issued an [emergency use authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply) for the JYNNEOS vaccine to allow healthcare providers to use the vaccine by [intradermal injection](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/jynneos-vaccine.html) for individuals 18 years of age and older who are determined to be at high risk for monkeypox infection. This alternative dosing approach will increase the total number of doses available for use by up to five-fold. The EUA also allows for use of the vaccine in individuals younger than 18 years of age determined to be at high risk of monkeypox infection; in these individuals JYNNEOS is administered by [subcutaneous injection](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/jynneos-vaccine.html).\n\nOn August 15, the Biden Administration, through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), [announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/08/15/biden-harris-administration-makes-hundreds-of-thousands-more-vaccine-doses-available-support-monkeypox-response.html#:~:text=The%20Biden%2DHarris%20Administration%2C%20through,NVS)%20to%20combat%20the%20current) that it is making up to 442,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine available for states and jurisdictions to order under an accelerated Phase 3 of the National Vaccine Strategy (NVS) to combat the current monkeypox outbreak.\n\n#### County, State and Federal Coordination\n\nOn August 2, President Biden [announced](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/02/president-biden-announces-team-to-lead-monkeypox-response/?utm_medium=Monkeypox+Response+Team) that he was appointing Robert Fenton, Regional Administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as the White House National Monkeypox Response Coordinator. Supporting him in the role of Deputy Coordinator is Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, Director of the CDC Division of HIV Prevention. The team will coordinate and manage response efforts across the White House and all federal departments and agencies, and work with local, state, national and international stakeholders to track and fight the spread of monkeypox through testing, treatment and vaccination efforts.\n\nThe CDC is also working with state and local health officials to identify individuals at risk for monkeypox due to their exposure to people who have tested positive for the virus, so they can monitor disease etiology. The agency is encouraging local health departments to report data for patients who meet the probable or confirmed cases of the virus to enhance federal surveillance efforts.\n\nThe federal PHE declaration in August follows local emergency declarations in some cities and states, including New York City, San Francisco, California, Illinois and New York. County health facilities are critical agents for infection and disease control and are playing a crucial role in testing, treating and vaccinating residents against the monkeypox virus.\n\nCounties should continue to work with their state and other local jurisdictions to track and report on monkeypox cases, and order vaccination and treatment supplies.

The risk to the general population is assessed as low.\n\n## As of October 20, 2025\n\n### New clade I monkeypox cases in the U.S.\n\nCalifornia has reported multiple clade I monkeypox cases stemming from local transmission of the virus. Our risk assessment **remains unchanged**, since the original assessment considered the likelihood of local spread of clade I monkeypox in the United States.\n\n## As of November 18, 2024\n\nCDC assessed the risk to the United States overall population and specific populations within the United States posed by the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and in countries in Central and Eastern Africa:\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2025/01/mpox_RA_table_all_Jan2025update.jpg)\n\n![Table showing Risk posed by the clade I monkeypox to the United States. See methods section for information on definitions.](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2025/01/mpox_RA_table_all_Jan2025update.jpg)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox to the United States. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to provide context about the ongoing outbreak of clade I monkeypox in DRC and in countries in Central and Eastern Africa, to inform U.S. preparedness efforts.\n\nThis assessment is an update to our August 30, 2024 [risk assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/previous-mpox-risk-assessment-august-update/index.html), incorporating new evidence and breaking out specific populations at risk. We note that the overall U.S. population includes the specific populations assessed, but we include specific populations separately because the clade I monkeypox outbreak in DRC and in countries in Central and Eastern Africa may pose higher risks to these populations. We chose these specific populations based on the most common monkeypox transmission routes for both the current clade I outbreak and the clade IIb outbreak that began in 2022.\n\nWe assessed overall risk by considering both likelihood and impact of infection in each population (see Methods section), under the assumption that a clade I monkeypox case was introduced into each population of interest. Both the likelihood and impact of infection are assessed at a population level. Likelihood of infection considers factors such as pathogen infectiousness and population susceptibility, while impact of infection considers factors such as disease severity, treatment availability, and public health response resources.\n\nWe assess risk to each population under the assumption that a clade I monkeypox case is introduced to these same populations. As of November 18, 2024, we are aware of the [first case](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1116-california-first-clade.html) of clade I monkeypox in the United States; given there has been no spread beyond this case to date, this assessment does not change.\n\nWe [continue to monitor](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/situation-summary/index.html) the [outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in Central and Eastern Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/index.html) and will update this risk assessment if new information warrants changes.\n\n## Risk to the overall U.S. population\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-overall.png)\n\n![Table displaying very low likelihood, low to moderate impact, low risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to the overall U.S. population by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-overall.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to the overall U.S. population. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nWe assess the likelihood of infection for the overall U.S. population is [**very low**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).\n\nCDC experts believe transmission levels would likely be reduced in the United States compared to levels in DRC for several reasons, including smaller average household sizes, [modeling results](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-transmission.html), increased access to improved sanitation and healthcare, and the lack of zoonotic reservoirs of disease. We address risk for specific populations in the sections below.\n\n### Impact\n\nWe assess the impact of infection for the overall U.S. population is [**low to moderate**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html) **.**\n\nMost of the United States population has no immunity to the virus that causes monkeypox, leading to potentially higher impacts of infection. Additionally, acquired [immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) from previous infection with the virus that causes monkeypox is extremely low for the overall population. Vaccine-induced immunity from [monkeypox vaccination during the 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7213a4.htm?s_cid=mm7213a4_w) clade II monkeypox outbreak is also very low across the overall population. During the 2022 clade II monkeypox outbreak, vaccination was targeted to those at highest risk of infection, including men who have sex with men (MSM) with certain risk factors and their partners. Furthermore, [smallpox vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7233a3.htm) rates, which can offer some protection against monkeypox, declined substantially in the United States in the 1970s, when population-wide smallpox vaccination ceased due to eradication of the disease.\n\nOf note, the [reported](https://africacdc.org/download/africa-cdc-weekly-event-based-surveillance-report-november-2024/) case-fatality rate (CFR; 3%) in DRC from the ongoing clade I monkeypox outbreak is lower than reported rates from historical outbreaks (up to 11%). In addition to lower [reported](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) CFRs in the ongoing clade I monkeypox outbreak, morbidity and mortality from clade I monkeypox are likely to be lower in the United States as compared to DRC and neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Africa, because of greater access to high-quality supportive care and medical countermeasures, leading to potentially a lower impact of infection.\n\n## Risk to children\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-children.png)\n\n![Table displaying very low likelihood, moderate impact, low risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to U.S. children by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-children.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to U.S. children. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess that the likelihood of infection for children for clade I monkeypox through household transmission and direct contact would be **[very low](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html)**.\n\nWe do not expect transmission via household transmission or direct, non-sexual contact in the United States to reach levels observed in DRC, [nor affect children to the same degree](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/php/data-research/clade-i-mpox-in-children-in-africa-and-potential-impacts-on-children-in-the-united-states.html). Our assessment is based on [modeling results,](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-transmission.html) a smaller proportion of children in the U.S. population (18% under 15 years of age in the United States compared to [46%](https://www.unicef.org/media/100616/file/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo-2020-COAR.pdf) in DRC), smaller average U.S. household size, generally increased access to improved sanitation and healthcare in the United States, and the lack of the virus that causes monkeypox circulating in animals in the United States.\n\n[CDC modeling](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-transmission.html) suggests that direct contact transmission within and between households—including spread between children at daycares and schools—is unlikely to result in a large number of clade l monkeypox cases in the United States. Modeling results indicated that household transmission clusters would likely involve 10 or fewer monkeypox clade I cases, with minimal spread between households. Of note, these modeling results are based on clade Ia transmission dynamics and may be revised as new data become available on the more recently discovered clade Ib and its transmission dynamics.\n\nWe simulated household transmission through direct contact and transmission to other households through children's direct contact with other children at daycares and schools. Direct contact involves skin-to-skin contact and other direct contact with the virus that causes monkeypox, such as through sharing contaminated toys or bedding; this virus is not known to spread efficiently through respiratory secretions and is not known to be airborne.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess that the impact posed to children for clade I monkeypox through household transmission and direct, non-sexual contact would be **[moderate](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).**\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined in the above impact section, household and direct contact settings such as daycares or schools could be more impacted due to more significant disruption to daily activities and additional resources for public health measures. Monkeypox infection can be serious in children, and the vast majority of U.S. children have no immunity to monkeypox. Very few children in the United States have acquired [immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) from either previous infection with the virus that causes monkeypox, or vaccination with monkeypox or smallpox vaccines.\n\n## Risk to MSM via sexual transmission\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-msm.png)\n\n![Table displaying low to moderate likelihood, low to moderate impact, low to moderate risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to MSM via sexual transmission by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-msm.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to the overall U.S. population. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the likelihood of infection via sexual transmission for MSM and for people who have sex with MSM is **[low to moderate](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html)**. Of note, MSM with higher numbers of sexual partners may have a higher likelihood of exposure to the virus and thus their risk would be closer to the moderate risk range. If clade I monkeypox were introduced into this population, there would likely be sustained transmission of the virus, based on several factors, including widespread transmission in this population during the ongoing global clade IIb monkeypox outbreak that began in 2022, varying levels of population immunity, and insights from CDC modeling studies.\n\nMost U.S. cases of clade IIb monkeypox were among MSM and their sexual partners, suggesting this population could have the highest likelihood of exposure for clade I monkeypox if the virus spread to U.S. sexual networks. Additionally, only a minority of MSM whom CDC has recommended would benefit from vaccination have been fully vaccinated, though rates vary widely by jurisdiction. However, population immunity to monkeypox infection might reduce the risk of infection with clade I monkeypox, depending on levels of vaccination uptake and monkeypox infection following the 2022 outbreak of clade IIb monkeypox, which varies across communities in the United States. In addition, during the 2022 global monkeypox outbreak in the United States, MSM reported behavior adaptations that likely contributed to declines in monkeypox incidence, indicating that similar changes could occur in future outbreaks, leading to a reduced likelihood of infection at a population level.\n\nA 2023 [modeling study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10231941/) estimated that a jurisdiction's risk for sustained monkeypox recurrence depends on population monkeypox immunity levels, finding some [jurisdictions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10231941/table/T1/?report=objectonly) may have a high likelihood of sustained transmission. More recent [CDC modeling](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-gbmsm-technical-brief.html) found that counties with higher population-level immunity had decreased chances of a prolonged or large outbreak, relative to counties with lower immunity, if clade I monkeypox were to be introduced to MSM sexual networks in the United States. The study also found that counties with greater than 50% population-level immunity would have smaller outbreaks on average, involving fewer than 50 infections.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the impact of infection via sexual transmission for MSM and for people who have sex with MSM would be **[low to moderate](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html)**.\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined in the above impact sections, population immunity among MSM and their sexual partners is likely to additionally reduce the severity of infection. However, population immunity varies greatly across communities in the United States, meaning some communities would have higher impacts of infection than others. Additionally, outbreaks concentrated in MSM communities, even if less severe than the 2022 clade IIb monkeypox outbreak, will have a large impact in these communities and require significant public health resources.\n\n## Risk to adults via sexual transmission between men and women\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-adults.png)\n\n![Table displaying very low to low likelihood, low impact, low risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to adults via sexual transmission between men and women by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-adults.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to adults via sexual transmission between men and women. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the likelihood of infection for adults via sexual transmission between men and women would be [**very low to low**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).\n\nSustained, widespread sexual transmission of clade I monkeypox in adults via sexual transmission between men and women in the United States is unlikely, based on lack of widespread transmission in heterosexual sexual networks during the [2022 global clade IIb monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7132e3.htm?s_cid=mm7132e3_w), as well as insights from modeling studies. A [modeling study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38816-8) from the United Kingdom related to the 2022 outbreak indicated that lower partnership formation rates among heterosexuals prevented sustained transmission within these networks. Additionally, CDC modeling of the clade IIb outbreak has shown similar results for heterosexual sexual networks in the United States, indicating widespread transmission is unlikely.1 Results showed that clade I monkeypox could cause small clusters of cases in heterosexual sexual networks, including especially among sex workers and their contacts, and as such, likelihood of infection could be higher in these communities.\n\nEvidence of sexual transmission and transboundary spread in Central and Eastern Africa could indicate an increased risk of spread if clade I monkeypox is introduced to the United States. Outbreaks of clade I monkeypox associated with female sex workers and their contacts have been reported in some DRC provinces. Recent [genomic](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.13.24311951v1) [analyses](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) suggest that transmission of clade Ib monkeypox is primarily human-to-human and not due to recurring zoonotic introductions. The role of different monkeypox subclades in changing transmission dynamics remains uncertain.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the impact of infection for adults via sexual transmission between men and women would be [**low**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html) **.**\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined in above impact sections, the impact of infection could be greater for sex workers and individuals in high-contact sexual networks. However, behavioral adaptation in affected populations could play a role in reducing transmission, similar to what CDC observed in the [2022 outbreak](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.003). That said, adaptation may be harder to achieve in the context of sex work due to its effect on people's livelihoods, and vaccination in this community may be a more effective method of prevention. CDC and other public health agencies will likely require additional public health resources to reach hard-to-reach populations like sex workers and their contacts, leading to a higher impact of infection in this community.\n\n## Confidence\n\nWe have **moderate** [**confidence**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html) in this assessment, increased from low confidence in our last assessment (released on August 30, 2024), as more data has been collected on both disease transmission and differences between clade subtypes in DRC and neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Africa. We note the following uncertainties:\n\n- Implications for the United States are unclear due to the fact that most of the data from the recent spread of the clade I monkeypox outbreak originate in Central and Eastern Africa, which has different access to healthcare and social, economic, and cultural contexts.\n\n- Limited epidemiologic and genomic data are available regarding outbreaks in Central and Eastern Africa, including lack of detailed transmission dynamics in children and sexual networks.\n\n- Limited information is available on main routes of transmission and how these differ between the two circulating subclades of clade I _Monkeypox virus_, which leads to uncertainties in how extensively the virus could spread in the United States.\n\n- Inadequate data on the levels of prior immunity in MSM and their sexual partners and the extent to which behavior adaptations initiated during the 2022 outbreak have continued or will return.\n\n## Factors that could change our assessment\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#)\n\n### Geographic and population spread\n\n- Further detection of clade I monkeypox cases in the United States, particularly if there is evidence of domestic person-to-person transmission\n\n- Detection of clade I monkeypox outbreaks and sustained transmission in Europe or other regions with high volume of travel to the United States\n\n- Extensive clade I monkeypox spread outside Central and Eastern Africa, including among people attending mass gatherings or among other highly mobile populations\n\n### Transmission dynamics\n\n- Further evidence of person-to-person spread in Central or East African countries, outside of already recognized [activities](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/causes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html) that increase risk, such as exposure to animals or close contact with persons with monkeypox\n\n- Further evidence of widespread, prolonged chains of sexual transmission in non-endemic countries\n\n### Natural history and medical countermeasures\n\n- Further evidence of differentiated epidemiological patterns between monkeypox clades Ia and Ib\n\n- Data that suggests an increased or decreased illness severity of clade I monkeypox infection\n\n- Increased monkeypox vaccination coverage among groups at increased risk in the United States\n\n- Evidence of waning vaccine-induced immunity\n\n## Background and Methods\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#)\n\n### Ongoing outbreak and spread\n\nAs of November 18, 2024, the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://africacdc.org/download/africa-cdc-weekly-event-based-surveillance-report-november-2024) has resulted in almost 43,000 confirmed or suspected cases in 2024, including in Kinshasa and other urban areas of DRC. Cases in other regions of DRC with cross-border movement, such as Équateur and South Kivu Provinces, elevate the risk of disease spread outside of the country. As of November 18, 2024, there were 22 clade I monkeypox cases, including confirmed, probable, and suspected cases, in the neighboring Republic of the Congo, where clade Ia monkeypox is endemic. There are 71 confirmed clade I monkeypox cases in the neighboring Central African Republic, where clade Ia monkeypox is also endemic.\n\nClade lb monkeypox has more recently spread to non-endemic countries in Africa, including 1,834 confirmed cases in Burundi, 26 confirmed cases in Rwanda, 443 confirmed cases in Uganda, and 17 confirmed cases in Kenya, as of November 18, 2024. Epidemiologic data are [limited](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report-35--12-august-2024) for patients with monkeypox, and because of lack of laboratory confirmatory testing, we do not know the true number of cases. [Sustained spread](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.27.24314511v1.full.pdf) is occurring in Burundi and Uganda based on the geographic distribution of cases.\n\n### Travel-related cases\n\nSince August 15, Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and the UK have confirmed travel-associated cases of clade Ib monkeypox. These cases highlight the risk for travel-associated importations. As of November 16, there has been one reported clade I monkeypox case in the United States.\n\n### Descriptive Epidemiology\n\n_Monkeypox virus_ is divided into two clades (I and II) and four subclades (Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb). Clade I has different transmission dynamics by subclade, with clade Ia spreading through multiple modes of transmission including contact with infected animals, household contact, and sexual contact. Clade Ib appears predominantly to be spread through [intimate](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/causes/index.html) or sexual contact between adults.\n\nClade I monkeypox is endemic in Central Africa, and there are concurrent, ongoing outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in DRC. In previous outbreaks, clade I has caused a higher number of persons to have severe disease than clade II within close-contact settings, typically in a household. Historically, household transmission chains were typically small, although occasionally had involved up to [six generations of transmission](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/6/15-0579_article). While limited data are available, household transmission has likely played an important role in the current clade Ia outbreak in DRC, particularly for children. Transmission through patient care, in the absence of appropriate personal protective equipment, has also occurred. Transmission risk is highest among unvaccinated contacts; children and young adults are less likely to have vaccine-induced orthopoxvirus immunity since smallpox vaccination programs ended in [DRC](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1005769107), other affected countries, and the United States.\n\nAlthough clade I monkeypox is endemic in DRC, in 2023, health authorities began reporting a higher number of suspect cases and deaths across a wider geographic area that in some provinces affected atypical demographic groups. Approximately 66% of suspected monkeypox cases in DRC in 2024 were in children under age 15, similar to historical observations. However, areas that did not historically report monkeypox saw different transmission dynamics. For instance, adults were disproportionately affected in South Kivu province, where sexual transmission among adults was predominant. The South Kivu outbreak spread initially among [female sex workers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.05.24303395v1.full.pdf) before becoming more broadly distributed, with one [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.18.24313835v1.full-text) finding more than 80% of hospitalized cases reporting recent sexual contact in bars. Sexual transmission of clade I monkeypox was also confirmed in a small outbreak affecting MSM and women in [Kenge, Kwango](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/1/23-1164_article) Province, in March 2023.\n\nThe outbreaks in South Kivu and, more recently, in several East African countries, have been associated with clade Ib monkeypox. The younger age distribution of cases in Burundi—which has seen the most clade Ib cases outside of DRC—suggests that non-sexual transmission of clade Ib is also occurring. Clade Ib is a more recently detected sub-clade, and data from the DRC and a previous [animal study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22496894/) suggests clade Ib monkeypox cases appear to be clinically milder than clade Ia monkeypox cases. In addition, clade Ib monkeypox cases in DRC and Burundi have been associated with a [lower case fatality rate than clade Ia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) monkeypox cases.\n\nAs of November 16, 2024, one case of clade I monkeypox has been detected in the United States. In collaboration with public health partners and other government agencies, CDC has already increased surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, and case data reporting capacities, and provided clinician education to prepare for the possibility of clade I monkeypox cases occurring in the United States. CDC also continues to work, including with other U.S. government agencies, on multiple approaches to expand clade-specific testing domestically. The United States has monkeypox testing capacity in state public health laboratories and several commercial laboratories, including clade-specific testing and/or sequencing, and can also (in some laboratories) flag high-likelihood clade I monkeypox samples. Through a combination of these methods, up to 80% of monkeypox specimens are being clade typed within the United States.\n\n### Methods\n\nCDC subject-matter experts specializing in risk assessment methods, infectious disease modeling, global health, and monkeypox and other orthopoxviruses collaborated to develop this rapid assessment. Experts initially convened in February 2024 to discuss the need for an assessment examining the risks posed by the DRC outbreak to the United States, key evidence related to the DRC outbreak, and specific populations to include in the assessment. To conduct this assessment, experts considered evidence including epidemiologic data from Central and Eastern Africa, data from the ongoing 2022 monkeypox outbreak in the United States caused by clade IIb, and historical data on clade I monkeypox outbreaks in DRC. After the initial assessment was finalized in February, experts subsequently re-reviewed evidence and updated this assessment in early March, mid-March, mid-April, late June, late August, and November.\n\nOverall risk was estimated by combining the likelihood of infection and the impact of the disease. For example, low likelihood of infection combined with high impact of disease would result in moderate risk. The likelihood of infection refers to the probability that members of the overall U.S. population acquire monkeypox—which in turn depends on the likelihood of exposure, infectiousness of the disease, and susceptibility of the population. The impact of infection considers several factors, including the severity of disease, level of population immunity, availability of treatments, and necessary public health response resources. A degree of confidence was assigned to each level of the assessment, taking into account evidence quality, extent, and corroboration of information.\n\nFor more details on our methods, please see our rapid risk assessment [methods webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).\n\n## Previous Updates\n\nSee our [previous Monkeypox Risk Assessment since August 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/previous-mpox-risk-assessment-august-update/index.html).\n\nSee other [archived previous updates](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-previous-updates.html) of the Monkeypox Rapid Risk Assessment.\n\nOct. 20, 2025\n\n[Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#content-sources) [Print](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#print) [Share](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#share)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html \"Share to Facebook\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html&title=Risk%20to%20United%20States%20from%20clade%20I%20monkeypox%20outbreak%20in%20Central%20and%20Eastern%20Africa \"Share to LinkedIn\") [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html&text=Risk%20to%20United%20States%20from%20clade%20I%20monkeypox%20outbreak%20in%20Central%20and%20Eastern%20Africa \"Share to Twitter\") [Syndicate](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/sharecontent \"Embed this Page\")\n\nContent Source:\n\n[Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html)\n\nSources\n\n- Pollock E, Nakazawa Y, Asher J, Gift T, Spicknall I.

This includes patients who still need second doses or who may not have received vaccine at the start of the 2022 outbreak.\n\n\n  - Boosters (third doses) are not recommended at this time.\n\n  - Vaccines are available at many chain pharmacies and certain clinics—see [Mpox Vaccine Locator](https://empoweredagainstmpox.com/#locator-map).\n\n\n- Incorporate assessments for mpox risk and vaccination status at all routine sexual health visits, particularly for individuals who are gay, bisexual, transgender, or other men who have sex with men.​\n\n\nSummary\n\n## ​Backgrou​nd\n\nIn August 2025, so far, there has been an average of 13 clade II mpox cases per week (compared to 7.9 and 4.0 cases per week in July and June, respectively). While this increase has mostly occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area, travel between counties and sexual exposure associated with attending clubs, venues, parties, or other events is common. Most cases have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and their social networks. All of these cases have been clade II mpox, which has been circulating in California since 2022.\n\nAs a reminder, there are currently ongoing outbreaks of [clade I mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/situation-summary/index.html) in sub-Saharan Africa. Sporadic travel-associated cases have since been identified in the U.S. and other countries. At this time, people who have traveled to [countries with clade I mpox outbreaks](http://cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/index.html) and their close contacts are most at risk. All of the mpox cases in California in 2025 so far have been clade II.\n\n## Recomm​end​ations\n\nGiven this r​ecent increase in cases, providers are reminded to incorporate mpox evaluation and prevention into routine sexual health care, including when people are being tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or receiving [HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep) or [post-exposure prophylaxis](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/post-exposure-prophylaxis-pep) (PEP), [doxy PEP](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/STI/DoxyPEP.aspx), or treatment for HIV and ot​her STIs.\n\n**Clinical Recognition**\n\nMpox should be considered as a diffe​rential diagnosis in sexually active patients with [rash, lesion(s), or proctitis](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html). Testing is still warranted among vaccinated persons (or those with previous mpox infection) if [compatible signs and symptoms (PDF, 1.2MB)](https://californiaptc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mpox-Long-Job-Aid-CAPTC-Only-Revised-12.18.24-FINAL.pdf) are present. Symptoms among people with prior mpox infection or vaccination are more likely to be mild.\n\nRisk assessments including rece​nt sexual practices and [international travel history](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/index.html) (for clade I mpox exposure risk) can help guide clinical decision-making.\n\n**Testing**\n\nMpox testing is via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using lesion swabs, available through most commercial laboratories and some local public health laboratories.\n\n[If clade I mpox is suspected](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/CAHAN/First-Clade-I-Mpox-Case-Confirmed-in-California-and-the-United-States-in-a-Returning-Traveler.aspx) (e.g., an international traveler or a contact of an international traveler in the prior 21 days), promptly notify your local health department and the CDPH Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory (VRDL) to arrange expedited, comprehensive testing: (510) 307-8585 or [VRDL.submittal@cdph.ca.gov](mailto:VRDL.submittal@cdph.ca.gov).\n\n**Treatment**\n\nThere is no treatment specifically approved for mpox. Most cases of mpox are mild and resolve with [supportive care and pain management](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-care/index.html).\n\nFor patients with severe or complicated mpox infections, providers are advised to consult their infectious disease providers, CDPH, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Certain therapeutics may be recommended for these patients, as well as for patients with risk factors for disease progression (e.g., severe immunocompromise).\n\n**Vaccination**\n\nMpox vaccination with two doses, at least 28-days apart, is recommended for individuals who [may be at risk for mpox](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Vaccination.aspx).  This includes patients who still need second doses or who may not have received vaccine at the start of the 2022 outbreak.\n\nProviders should consider incorpo​​​rating assessments for mpox risk and vaccination status at all routine sexual health visits. To simplify assessment and improve community vaccination coverage among those at increased risk of exposure given current outbreak data, CDPH recommends the mpox vaccine for any person who:\n\n- Is gay, bisexual, or other man who has sex with men or\n\n- Is transgender, nonbinary, or gender-diverse or\n\n- Has HIV, or is taking/eligible for HIV PrEP or doxy PEP or\n\n- Was exposed to someone with mpox in the last 14 days or\n\n- Is planning to travel to [sub-Saharan Africa or a country with a clade I mpox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/index.html) and anticipates sexual or intimate contact while traveling or\n\n- Anticipates attending a commercial sex event or venue (like a sex club or bathhouse) or\n\n- Has a sex partner with any of the above risks or\n\n- Requests mpox vaccination, even if they have not disclosed any risks listed above\n\n\nWhile no vaccine is perfectly effective, mpox vaccination remains the best strategy to minimize the risks of acquiring mpox and protect against complications including severe illness, hospitalization, and death.\n\n- Vaccination may be especially important to prevent severe disease in patients with HIV or other immunocompromise.\n\n- Vaccines are available at many chain pharmacies and certain clinics—see [Mpox Vaccine Locator](https://empoweredagainstmpox.com/#locator-map).\n\n- As of 2025, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/vaccine-considerations/vaccination-overview.html#cdc_generic_section_17-why-boosters-arent-currently-recommended) and the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines do not recommend more than two vaccine doses (boosters) or vaccination for people who have recovered from previous mpox infection.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n- Bavarian Nordic: [Mpox Vaccine Locator](https://empoweredagainstmpox.com/#locator-map)\n\n- California Prevention Training Center \\| [Mpox Clinical Recognition & Testing Overview (PDF, 1.2MB)](https://californiaptc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mpox-Long-Job-Aid-CAPTC-Only-Revised-12.18.24-FINAL.pdf)\n\n- CDPH \\| [Local Health Department Communicable Disease Contact List](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCLHO/Pages/LHD-Communicable-Disease-Contact-List.aspx)\n\n- CDPH STD Control Branch: [stdcb@cdph.ca.gov](mailto:stdcb@cdph.ca.gov) or [mpoxadmin@cdph.ca.gov](mailto:mpoxadmin@cdph.ca.gov); phone: (510) 620-3400.\n\n- CDPH \\| [Mpox Treatment Information for Providers](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Tecovirimat-Treatment-Information-for-Providers.aspx)\n\n- CDPH \\| [Provider and Health System Access to Commercially Available JYNNEOS Vaccine in California (PDF)](https://eziz.org/assets/docs/Mpox/ResourceforProviders_%20JYNNEOSonCommercialMarket.pdf)\n\n- CDPH \\| [Health Advisory: First Clade I Mpox Case Confirmed in California and the United States in a Returned Traveler (11/19/2024)](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/CAHAN/First-Clade-I-Mpox-Case-Confirmed-in-California-and-the-United-States-in-a-Returning-Traveler.aspx)\n\n- CDPH VRDL (for clade I testing): 510-307-8585 or [VRDL.Submittal@cdph.ca.gov](mailto:VRDL.Submittal@cdph.ca.gov)\n\n- CDC Poxvirus and Rabies Branch \\| [poxvirus@cdc.gov](mailto:poxvirus@cdc.gov) or after hours via the CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at (770) 488-7100\n\n- CDC \\| [Mpox Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/vaccines/index.html)\n\n- CDC \\| [Clinical Features of Mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html)\n\n- CDC \\| [Safer Sex, Social Gatherings, and Mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/prevention/safer-sex-social-gatherings-and-mpox.html)\n\n- CDC \\| [Clade I Mpox Outbreak Originating in Africa](http://cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/index.html)\n\n\n![Public Health Accredited Health Department Logo](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/images/phab-logo.png)\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n\n\nPO Box, 997377, MS 0500, Sacramento, CA 95899-7377\n\n\nDepartment Website ( [cdph.ca.gov](http://cdph.ca.gov/ \"link to cdph.ca.gov\")\n)\n\n\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\nTwitter Widget Iframe",

It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever.  It can make people very sick and leave scars.\n\nA global outbreak of mpox began in May 2022 and continues to this day. In recent months, cases have been increasing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A new strain of the virus, called Clade Ib, is causing outbreaks in previously unaffected areas of the country and has spread to countries that had not previously reported mpox.\n\nWHO is workingwith affected countries and partners to contain these outbreaks.\n\nThis content was last updated on 3 October 2024.\n\n\n[Mpox outbreak: global trends](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/)\n\n[Mpox](https://www.who.int/health-topics/mpox)\n\n[Questions and answers](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/mpox)\n\n[Fact sheet](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mpox)\n\n## News\n\n[All →](https://www.who.int/news?healthtopics=c72af405-a7c2-4a06-980e-09adf19eb376&newstypes=)\n\n[30 October 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStatement\\\\\n\\\\\nFifth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024](https://www.who.int/news/item/30-10-2025-fifth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024)\n\n[10 July 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStatement\\\\\n\\\\\nFourth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024](https://www.who.int/news/item/10-07-2025-fourth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024)\n\n[9 June 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStatement\\\\\n\\\\\nFourth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox 2024 – Temporary recommendations](https://www.who.int/news/item/09-06-2025-fourth-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024-temporary-recommendations)\n\n[17 April 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nJoint News Release\\\\\n\\\\\nAfrica CDC and WHO update mpox strategy as outbreaks persist](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-04-2025-africa-cdc-and-who-update-mpox-strategy-as-outbreaks-persist)\n\n## Highlights\n\n![](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/cover-images/who-documents/who-appeal-mpox-health-emergency-2024-thumbnail.tmb-144v.png?sfvrsn=46e86c69_1)\n\n27 August 2024\n\n[**WHO appeal: mpox public health emergency 2024**](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-appeal--mpox-public-health-emergency-2024)\n\n[Download](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/who_appeal-mpox_2024.pdf?sfvrsn=9c2488f6_3&download=true)\n\n[Read More](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-appeal--mpox-public-health-emergency-2024)\n\n![](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/cover-images/who-documents/mpox-sprp-2024-thumbnaildaec362d-2534-4c45-a668-5835b98e4682.tmb-144v.jpg?sfvrsn=ebf3a447_1)\n\n26 August 2024\n\n[**Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan**](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan)\n\nThe SPRP for mpox provides a framework for public health preparedness and response to the mpox emergency.\n\n[Download](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/health-topics/monkeypox/jmo_who_sprp-mpox_2024_final_digital.pdf?sfvrsn=3a670f76_1&download=true)\n\n[Read More](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan)\n\n![A laboratory technician prepares the samples of the monkeypox for PCR diagnosis](https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies-and-disasters/2024---mpox-outbreak/mpox-samples-for-pcr-diagnosis.jpg?sfvrsn=2036d415_13)\n\n### Mpox outbreak toolbox\n\n[Learn more about WHO's guidelines and advice on mpox](https://www.who.int/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit/disease-outbreak-toolboxes/mpox-outbreak-toolbox \"Learn more about WHO's guidelines and advice on mpox\")\n\nSituation reports\n\n[All →](https://www.who.int/publications/m?healthtopics=c72af405-a7c2-4a06-980e-09adf19eb376&meetingreporttypes=ce6cf3c6-43fc-49bf-9c4c-71bd965ee047)\n\n[30 October 2025 \\\\\n**Multi-country outbreak of mpox, External situation report \\#59 -

Most of the deaths associated to mpox were among individuals with advanced HIV infection, unaware of their status or disengaged from care. Therefore, all individuals with lesions suspected to be mpox should be offered HIV test to be able to start antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible.\n\nPAHO is working with clinicians in Member States to learn and disseminate information on clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and clinical management practices of suspected and confirmed mpox infections.\n\nThe Organization is continuously evaluating IPC interventions that can prevent transmission of mpox to health care workers in occupational settings in countries in the Region. PAHO routinely participates in meetings with WHO to define the need to update the management guide for cases, and guidelines for infection control and prevention.\n\nWebinars are periodically held to disseminate IPC and clinical management recommendations for persons with mpox, including home care of uncomplicated cases.\n\nThe WHO Clinical Platform for Mpox collects anonymized data to understand the clinical features and outcomes of mpox. Guidance documents for clinical management and infection prevention and control, are being updated.\n\nWHO has launched a call for Expressions of Interest to receive a donation of tecovirimat for use under the Revised MERUI protocol. Countries interested in receiving this drug should contact the local PAHO office for more details. A new Atlas of Mpox lesions has been published to harmonize the assessments of lesions and improve the quality of the collected data.\n\nWHO produced infographic material to support the triage, screening tools, differential diagnostic and management of lesions, available in different languages here.\n\n# Vaccination\n\nDuring the 2022-2023 period, 14 countries in the region acquired 106,400 vaccine doses through the Revolving Fund (RF), as part of their mpox prevention and control plans. An additional 47,600 doses were purchased in September 2024, following the WHO declaration of mpox as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nIt is important that countries update their mpox vaccination plans as part of the national response plan, considering the epidemiological scenario and permanent recommendations, which aim to advance mpox prevention and control in accordance with the WHO Strategic Framework 2024-2027. This vaccination plan should be based on the most up-to-date recommendations of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), WHO vaccination position papers and technical guidelines, and TAG reports.\n\nBetween May 2022 and February 2025, 9 countries administered 36,288 complete vaccination series: Chile $\\\\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 1 7 , 7 0 1 ) .$ ), Brazil $( \\\\mathsf { n } { = } 1 2 , 3 0 2 )$ , Ecuador $( n = 3 , 7 6 1$ ), Panama $\\_ { ( n = 1 , 6 8 2 ) }$ , Peru $\\\\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 6 7 6 )$ , El Salvador $( n = 1 1 2 )$ , Dominican Republic $\\\\scriptstyle ( 1 7 = 2 9 )$ , Bahamas $( n = 1 4 )$ and Honduras $\\\\scriptstyle ( 1 = 1 1 )$ . The following figure describes the number of people who have completed the mpox vaccination schedule in each country.\n\n![](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/images/cdf1ff5ed45b033ac4de83f4b1c0c4212ae95de84200e8c987ec8b105912c119.jpg)\n\nFigure 2.

Source:PAHOMpoxformupdatedon2025/02/25\n\nIt is important to take into consideration that, as reported by the Revolving Fund and the WHO, there is limited availability of vaccines and that the vaccines currently available through the RF are already allocated. Given that in the short and medium term, vaccine availability is expected to be very limited, countries are recommended to consider vaccine deployment in phases in their vaccination plans, according to the epidemiological scenario and prioritization of groups at higher risk of severe disease. To this end, it is important to maintain an updated analysis of the mpox situation in order to guide prevention and control actions, in which vaccination is one of the components.\n\nIn managing the outbreak response, vaccination should be considered as an additional measure to complement primary public health interventions. At the individual level, vaccination should not replace other protective measures.\n\n# Risk Communication and Community Engagement\n\nPAHO has held webinars together with Ministries of Health and organized Civil Societies on topics including mpox epidemiology, clinical presentations, infection prevention and control, prevention, and treatment.\n\nPAHO has worked with non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and community-led services working with gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men as partners for engagement and risk communication activities with these vulnerable populations. The organization has issued public health recommendations for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (available on the PAHO website).\n\nThe organization has developed and distributed brochures/pamphlets to be used in print and digital with information and general recommendations for the community of gay, bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men to share/distribute with organizers or attendees of festivals and other massive events, and on social media. Flyers with mpox facts and measures for recovering at home and key information for sex workers were also distributed at healthcare facilities and organizations serving high-risk groups.\n\nPAHO has been monitoring travel measures for mpox through a methodical search across 35 countries in the Region of the Americas. To date, there are no travel measures in any of these countries, which aligns with WHO’s recommendations.\n\nAdditionally, PAHO has constructed a calendar that categorizes events by type (cultural, sporting, religious, political, and pride) and country. In the first half of November, 3 cultural events (Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Panama), 2 political events (Colombia, and the United States of America), and 7 sporting events (Dominican Republic, Brazil, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Paraguay, Ecuador, Uruguay, Peru) were observed. For the second half of November, 3 cultural events (Guatemala, Mexico, Panama), 8 sporting events (Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, the United States of America, Paraguay, Peru), and a Pride Parade in Brazil are scheduled.\n\nThe WHO has also released two documents: “Considerations for border health and points of entry for mpox” and “Gatherings in the context of the 2024 Mpox outbreak: Public Health guidance.” These documents provide comprehensive advice for managing mpox in these environments, emphasizing coordination, surveillance, and non-discriminatory practices. The first document targets national and subnational health authorities, PoE authorities, public health professionals, civil society organizations, and regional authorities. The second document is aimed at host governments, health authorities, event organizers, healthcare providers, and attendees of meetings of any size and type. These documents are being translated into Spanish and will be sent to the countries, along with the calendar.",

The case was diagnosed in a person who recently traveled from Eastern Africa. The individual was treated shortly after returning to the United States at a local medical facility and released. Since then, the person has isolated at home, is not on treatment specific for mpox, and symptoms are improving. Casual contact, like one might have during travel, is unlikely to pose significant risks for transmission of mpox. While investigations continue into this case, CDC guidance has not changed. [California confirms first clade I mpox case \\| CDC Newsroom](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/s1116-california-first-clade.html) |\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| **September 2024:** Pediatricians should be alert for the signs and symptoms of mpox in children and adolescents traveling from the Democratic Republic of Congo or a country where mpox is occurring in the last 21 days, or children who have contact with persons who have recently been in a country where mpox transmission is occurring. |\n\n## **Overview**\n\nMpox (formerly known as monkeypox) virus has two distinct genetic clades (subtypes), I and II, which are endemic to central and west Africa, respectively. The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently monitoring increasing reports of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since 2023. These cases involve a virus type (clade I) that can cause more infections that are severe than the virus type that has been causing the ongoing 2022 global mpox outbreak (clade II).\n\nBoth clade I and clade II mpox can lead to a large number of lesions distributed across the body and a need for inpatient clinical management. While clade II mpox is self-limited in immunocompetent persons, clade I mpox may cause severe disease in a higher proportion of patients, with case fatality rates ranging from 1.4% to over 10% for historic outbreaks. It may also spread more easily among household contacts.\n\n**Clade I Mpox Outbreak in Central Africa**\n\nWhile clade I mpox is endemic in DRC, many of these cases are being reported in new provinces and urban areas where mpox does not normally occur. In addition, the suspected cases and deaths include high numbers of children. There have never been documented cases of clade I mpox within the United States. CDC is coordinating with state, tribal, local, and territorial jurisdictions, other federal agencies, and private partners to ensure that the United States is prepared if clade I mpox begins to spread globally.\n\nSince mpox was first recognized in the 1970s, the majority of cases in DRC have been in children. Transmission often occurs through contact with wild animals that carry the virus, or through close, prolonged contact with cases in a household. In the current outbreak in DRC, CDC is not aware of any confirmed reports of mpox spreading among children in schools. However, spread within households is possible, and is usually associated with close, prolonged contact with ill family members or shared spaces. Malnutrition and other diseases may also be contributing to the high rates of severe illness being observed.\n\nThe potential risk of clade I mpox cases in children in the United States remains very low. There are no animal reservoirs of mpox in the United States, and other factors, such as average family size and access to healthcare, are vastly different.\n\n**Ongoing Clade II Mpox Global Outbreak**\n\nSince the start of the ongoing mpox clade II global outbreak that started in May 2022, there have been 32,063 confirmed cases of mpox and 58 deaths in the US. As of January 10, 2024, CDC is no longer updating the mpox outbreak US case count. There has not been a marked change in weekly or monthly national case counts during the last 6 months. The majority of US cases continue to be in people who are not vaccinated or who have only received one dose of JYNNEOS vaccine (see Vaccination section below). This mpox clade II outbreak is part of a larger global outbreak: [2022-2023 Mpox Outbreak Global Map \\| CDC Archive](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/world-map.html).\n\nThe risk of children getting infected with mpox clade II virus is low. Of the total 32,063 US mpox cases, 64 cases have been reported in children 0-15 years old and 699 cases have been reported in adolescents/young adults 16-20 years old in the US. More information on mpox clade II outbreak case demographics can be found here: [Mpox Cases by Age and Gender and Race and Ethnicity \\| CDC Archive](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/demographics.html)\n\n**Clinical Guidance (Clade I and II)**\n\n- **Presentation:** Mpox should be suspected in patients presenting with a [rash consistent with mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/), especially (but not solely) in patients with exposure to someone known to have or suspected to have mpox. Clinical judgement and consultation with an infectious disease specialist and/or your local public health department is important in determining who needs testing, as the overwhelming majority of children who present with a rash will have an alternative etiology.\n\n  - The rash associated with mpox produces macules that progress to papules, vesicles, and then pustules that are deep-seated, firm or hard, and well-circumscribed; the lesions may umbilicate or become confluent and progress over time to scabs. Rash may spread to other parts of the body. In classic mpox, lesions on a particular body part are in the same stage. This has not always been the case in the current outbreak, with lesions in varying stages of progression being seen in many patients in the US currently, and lesions may be few in number, and limited to one area.\n  - Presenting symptoms typically include fever, chills, malaise, sore throat, headache, and new lymphadenopathy, followed by the distinctive rash. In the current outbreak, onset of perianal or genital lesions in the absence of fever or other systemic symptoms or concurrently with systemic symptoms also has been reported. Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing or cough when oropharyngeal lesions are present. Ocular lesions may present with eyelid swelling or crusting.\n  - The rash associated with mpox can be confused with other diseases that are more commonly encountered in clinical practice (eg, [syphilis](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14082371/Syphilis#14553284), [herpes simplex virus \\[HSV\\]](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14078065/Herpes-Simplex#14548994), [chancroid](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14076058/Chancroid-and-Cutaneous-Ulcers#14546921), [varicella zoster](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14083489/Varicella-Zoster-Virus-Infections#14554441), and [molluscum contagiosum](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14079612/Molluscum-Contagiosum#14550472)). In addition, some patients have been coinfected with syphilis or HSV and mpox. A high index of suspicion for mpox is warranted when evaluating patients with a new onset of clinically compatible rash, who present with lesions in the genital/perianal area or for patients who had contact with a suspected or known case of mpox.\n  - Pediatricians can review the case definition for more information: [Mpox Case Definitions \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/case-definitions/)\n\n- **Diagnosis:** If a patient is suspected of having mpox, the clinician should contact the health department to discuss testing. Testing is performed on skin lesion material (dry swab, swab placed in viral culture media, or crusts) or mucosal lesion material. Testing on blood or other body fluids is not available. For information on testing specimens that will be sent to a Laboratory Response Network (LRN) site see [Guidelines for Collecting and Handling Specimens for Mpox Testing \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/diagnosis-testing/collecting-specimens.html). Clinicians should be aware that false positive tests have occurred in patients (including children) who were at low risk, without a known epidemiological link, and who had a high real-time PCR cycle threshold value; for more information see [_MMWR_](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7136e1.htm).\n- **Complications:** Patients with mpox can develop a variety of complications, including encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, pneumonia, sepsis, hemorrhagic disease, myocarditis, pericarditis, other conditions requiring hospitalization, blindness (secondary to ocular infection), and bacterial skin infections. If the patient is pregnant, there may be complications, including preterm delivery, fetal death, or congenital disease; data are very limited. For more information: [Mpox Monitoring and Risk Assessment for People Exposed in the Community \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/php/monitoring/)\n- **Precautions:** Mpox spreads person to person primarily through contact with infectious rashes, prolonged face-to-face contact, or items that previously touched the infectious rash or body fluids. Standard precautions should be applied for all patient care, including for patients with suspected mpox. If a patient seeking care is suspected to have mpox, infection prevention and control personnel should be notified immediately. In the inpatient setting, persons with suspected or confirmed mpox should be placed in a single patient room with a dedicated bathroom. Special air handling for mpox is not required except during aerosol-generating procedures (although airborne isolation is required for some infections associated with rash, such as varicella or measles). Intubation, extubation, and any procedure likely to spread oral secretions should be performed in a negative pressure isolation room. In ambulatory healthcare settings, the lesions of patients with suspected or confirmed mpox should be covered and patients who are at least 2 years of age should be masked. Patients should be put in an exam room promptly. In both inpatient and ambulatory settings, the PPE used by healthcare personnel who enter the patient’s room should include a gown, gloves, eye protection (ie, goggles or face shield), and a NIOSH-approved particulate respirator equipped with N95 filters or higher. For more information: [How Mpox Spreads \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/causes/index.html).\n- **Infection Prevention and Control:** In addition to Standard Precautions, if a patient seeking care is suspected to have MPXV infection, additional infection control precautions should be implemented. Recommendations can be found at: [Mpox Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Settings \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/infection-control/healthcare-settings.html)\n- **Home Isolation:** Children and adolescents with mpox who do not require hospitalization should be isolated at home. Infected persons should avoid contact with uninfected people and pets until the rash has resolved, the scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed. When possible, the number of caregivers should be limited to one person who has been educated about infection prevention strategies. Caregivers should wear a respirator or well-fitting face mask, cover areas of broken skin with bandages and clothing to the extent possible and avoid direct skin-to-skin contact with the rash. During interactions with uninfected caregivers, children over 2 years of age with mpox should wear well-fitting source control (eg, a medical mask) when possible. Caregivers assisting with changing bandages or clothes covering the rash should wear gloves to avoid infection, dispose of gloves after use and perform handwashing. For questions about home isolation for individual patients and circumstances, discussion with local or state health departments is recommended. For more information: [Isolation and Infection Control At Home \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/infection-control/at-home.html)\n\n**Risk Mitigation**\n\n- **Exposure Reduction:** Pediatricians should educate patient and families traveling to the DRC or neighboring countries about how to avoid exposure to mpox:\n\n  - Avoid close contact with people who are sick with [signs and symptoms of mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/signs-symptoms/), including those with skin or genital lesions.\n  - Avoid contact with wild animals (alive or dead), such as small mammals, including rodents (rats, squirrels), and non-human primates (monkeys, apes).\n  - Avoid contact with contaminated materials used by people who are sick (such as clothing, bedding, or materials used in healthcare settings) or that came into contact with wild animals.\n  - Avoid eating or preparing meat from wild animals ( [bushmeat](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/animal-products/bushmeat.html)) or using products (creams, lotions, powders) derived from wild animals.\n  - Some persons aged 18 and older may qualify for mpox vaccine before travel.\n- **Vaccination:** CDC recommends that people whose jobs (clinical or research laboratories and certain healthcare and public health team members) may expose them to orthopoxviruses, such as mpox, get vaccinated with JYNNEOS or ACAM2000 to protect them from an orthopoxvirus infection. At this point, vaccination is not recommended for most healthcare providers. [ACIP recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations) vaccination with the 2-dose JYNNEOS vaccine series for persons aged 18 years and older at risk for mpox. The standard regimen for JYNNEOS vaccine is a 0.5 mL dose administered subcutaneously followed by a second dose 28 days later.  Persons at risk:\n\n  - Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, transgender or nonbinary people who in the past 6 months have had one of the following:\n    - A new diagnosis of ≥1 sexually transmitted disease\n    - More than one sex partner\n    - Sex at a commercial sex venue\n    - Sex in association with a large public event in a geographic area where mpox transmission is occurring\n    - Sexual partners of persons with the risks described above\n    - Persons who anticipate experiencing any of the above\n- **Post-exposure Prophylaxis:** Children and adolescents who have had close physical contact withsomeone with a known or suspected mpox infection may qualify for [post-exposure prophylaxis](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/vaccines/index.html).\n\n  - Public health officials may recommend vaccine for contacts of mpox cases, especially those that are found to be at high risk. Healthcare providers who have unprotected, high risk contact with patients with mpox may be eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis in consultation with public health authorities.\n  - JYNNEOS vaccine may be recommended for and given to children <18 years of age for post-exposure prophylaxis under an emergency use authorization protocol. Clinicians should discuss use of vaccine in a child as post-exposure prophylaxis with the state or local health department. Only subcutaneous administration of JYNNEOS vaccine is authorized for children <18 years of age.\n  - Vaccinia immune globulin is available through an IND protocol for the potential prevention of mpox, but its effectiveness is unknown. Vaccinia immune globulin is an alternative to vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis, especially in children <6 months of age.\n  - Tecovirimat (TPOXX, ST-246) may be considered for post-exposure prophylaxis when vaccine is contraindicated; its effectiveness is unknown. Information about tecovirimat availability through the STOMP study or EA-IND: [Tecovirimat (TPOXX) for Treatment of Mpox \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-care/tecovirimat.html)\n- **Treatment:** Mpox is typically a self-limiting condition. Some patients are at higher risk for severe disease and should be considered for treatment on a case-by-case basis, including immunocompromised patients, pregnant or breastfeeding persons, children under 1 year, and those with atopic dermatitis or another condition that affects skin integrity. In addition, those with complicated or severe disease, or with lesions in the areas that might result in severe sequelae, including scarring and strictures (eye, mouth, genitals, or anus/rectum), should be considered for treatment. Tecovirimat is considered first-line treatment for those patients who require treatment. Additional potential treatments for mpox in children include tecovirimat, vaccinia immunoglobulin, brincidofovir, and cidofovir. For more information: [Clinical Considerations for Mpox in Children and Adolescents in the U.S. \\| Mpox \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-care/pediatric.html)\n- **Reporting and assistance:** Clinicians should report cases to state or local health departments ( [State Contacts](https://www.cste.org/page/EpiOnCall)) as soon as mpox is suspected.

In addition, several mpox cases linked to the DRC outbreak have now been identified in some non-African countries, including Sweden and Thailand. Due to these circumstances, in mid-August 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) each declared mpox to be a public health emergency requiring a globally coordinated response.\n- This is the second time mpox has been declared an international emergency, with the first spanning 2022-2023. The current mpox outbreak centered in the DRC is being driven by the “clade I” strain of the virus, with a clade Ia variant that is primarily affecting children and a more recently identified clade Ib variant that is spreading primarily via sexual contact among adults. The previous international emergency was driven by a “clade II” strain, and primarily affected adult gay and bisexual men. Currently, there is ongoing transmission of both clades affecting mostly different geographic areas.\n- The U.S. government has provided technical and financial assistance for mpox response in DRC and elsewhere for years. Following the emergency declarations it has increased this support, including by delivering 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the DRC and 10,000 doses to Nigeria, as well as providing $10 million in mpox response-specific funding. On September 24, President Biden also pledged to donate up to 1 million more vaccine doses and an additional $500 million in funding to support mpox response across Africa.\n- Since the emergency declarations, the Africa CDC, WHO, and governments of affected countries have accelerated efforts to respond to the situation by developing updated response plans, mobilizing more funds and attention from policymakers, and working to obtain more mpox vaccine doses. Still, the response faces a number of challenges including an uncertain path to delivering mpox vaccines at scale, lack of access to prevention tools, poor health infrastructure in many affected areas along with ongoing conflicts and instability, and high levels of distrust and misinformation in affected communities.\n- No cases of clade I mpox have been identified in the U.S. as of September 26, 2024, and the CDC estimates the risk to the general public in the U.S. from the current outbreak in African countries is very low. However, clade II mpox infections continue to occur in the U.S. primarily among adult gay and bisexual men, though case numbers have declined since the previous mpox emergency in 2022-2023.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMajor outbreaks of [mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/index.html) are again raising significant international concern. The DRC in particular has reported a large increase in cases driven by the “clade I” strain of the mpox virus, including a “clade Ia” variant that is primarily affecting children and a more recently identified “clade Ib variant” that is spreading primarily via sexual contact among adults. Clade I cases are also being reported in some other African nations, and several cases of the clade Ib variant have now been identified in non-African countries. At the same time, there continue to be mpox cases caused by “clade II” mpox, which was the variant that led to an earlier public health emergency in 2022-2023 in many different regions and countries around the world, including in the U.S. The recent circumstances led to two public health emergency declarations: the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) [declared](https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-declares-mpox-a-public-health-emergency-of-continental-security-mobilizing-resources-across-the-continent/) mpox to be a “public health emergency of continental security” (PHECS) for Africa on August 13, 2024, and the WHO Director-General [declared](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern) the mpox outbreaks a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) on August 14, 2024.\n\nThis explainer answers key questions about the international response to date, including the U.S. government’s role globally, and identifies issues and challenges that may affect the response going forward. It also discusses how the global emergency might affect the U.S. and the current status of mpox circulation within the U.S. It will be updated as needed.\n\n## Key Questions\n\n### What is mpox?\n\nMpox is a disease caused through infection with the mpox virus (MPXV). The first human case of mpox was identified in 1970, and since then, the virus has caused intermittent outbreaks. It is considered [endemic](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/about/index.html) in several Central, East, and West African countries, where infections have traditionally occurred through exposure to rodents or other animals carrying the virus. Human-to-human spread is [also possible](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/causes/), primarily through close contact such as skin-to-skin contact and sexual or other contact with infected body fluids. Mpox can also pass from mother to fetus during pregnancy and during or after birth. Mpox infections can lead to symptoms such as fever, headaches, and body aches, and the development of a rash with lesions. Some infections can cause severe illness and even death, and there is a higher risk for severe outcomes in those with [weaker immune systems](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/people-with-HIV.html) such as [people with HIV](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/hiv.htm) who are not virally suppressed and [children](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/pediatric.html). In areas with poor health care infrastructure and a lack of access to prevention tools, testing, treatment, and supportive care, mpox can be more difficult to identify, treat, and contain.\n\nIn recent years, more sustained human-to-human transmission and larger mpox outbreaks have been recorded from two genetic families of mpox virus (known as clade I and clade II mpox viruses; see Box 1). Most notably, in 2022, an outbreak of clade II mpox virus emerged from West Africa and spread globally, eventually affecting more than 100 countries and causing over 100,000 reported cases, including over 30,000 cases [in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7220a2.htm) alone. That global outbreak was declared a PHEIC by WHO between [July 2022](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/23-07-2022-who-director-general-declares-the-ongoing-monkeypox-outbreak-a-public-health-event-of-international-concern) and [May 2023](https://www.paho.org/en/news/11-5-2023-who-declares-end-mpox-emergency-calls-sustained-efforts-long-term-management-disease) , and also declared a public health emergency [in the U.S.](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/key-questions-about-the-current-u-s-monkeypox-outbreak/) in [August 2022](https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PHE/Pages/monkeypox-4Aug22.aspx), marking the first time mpox had become a significant public health threat in non-endemic countries. Adult gay and bisexual men, especially men of color, made up the [vast majority](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/mpox-one-year-later-where-is-the-u-s-today/) of cases during that outbreak in the U.S.\n\nStrains of mpox virus (MPXV) from both clades have [continued](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/situation-summary/index.html) to circulate in largely [geographically separate](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MPox-Situation-in-Africa.pdf) sets of endemic African countries, with clade II mpox infections primarily found in West African and Southern African countries and clade I infections found in Central African countries, the DRC in particular. In addition, clade II infections continue to be identified in [many countries](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/) outside endemic regions, including in the U.S., primarily in gay and bisexual men, though the number of reported cases has declined significantly since the 2022 global outbreak.\n\nBox 1: Epidemiology of Mpox Virus (MPXV) Clades I and II\n\nThere are two main genetic families of MPXV, known as [**clade I** and **clade II**](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00055-5/fulltext), and each clade is divided into sub-clades ( **clade Ia**, **clade Ib**, **clade IIa**, and **clade IIb**) based on genetic similarities and differences.\n\n[Historically](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.81215-0), clade I MPXV infections have been identified primarily in Central African countries, the DRC in particular, while clade II MPXV infections have been identified primarily in West African countries. In 2022, clade II MPXV emerged from West Africa to cause a global outbreak, primarily spread via sexual contact among adult gay and bisexual men. While that outbreak subsided following its 2022 peak, new cases of clade II MPXV infection continue to be reported in a number of countries worldwide, including African countries and the U.S.\n\nIn recent years, clade Ia and clade Ib MPXV have been circulating [concurrently](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.13.24311951v2) in the DRC and in Africa, and some clade Ib infections have also been identified outside of Africa:\n\n- Clade Ia MPXV: Infections continue to occur mostly in central DRC, affecting children exposed to infected animals with some additional ongoing human-to-human transmission due to close contact among family members or caregivers.\n- Clade Ib MPXV: [First](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2024.29.11.2400106) [described](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) in 2023; infections have been found primarily in eastern DRC and neighboring African countries. This includes several countries [reporting](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report-35--12-august-2024) mpox cases for the first time ever, such as Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. In areas affected by clade Ib, the majority of cases have occurred in adults and transmission appears to be [sustained](https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2024-first-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024) “largely, but not exclusively, through transmission linked to sexual contact and amplified in networks associated with commercial sex and sex workers.”\n\nAvailable data suggest clade Ia MPXV infections are more likely to be [severe cases and cause deaths](https://www.science.org/content/article/deadlier-strain-mpox-spreads-more-african-countries) than infections from clade IIa or clade IIb MPXV. While there is limited data on the severity of clade Ib, early indications are that it may not be as severe as clade Ia. Still, more data and studies are needed to fully understand the extent of biological and epidemiological differences across mpox sub-clades.\n\n### Why has mpox again been declared a public health emergency this year?\n\nWHO and Africa CDC issued the emergency declarations due to the recent rapid rise in case numbers and expanded geographic reach of mpox. Of primary concern has been mpox in the DRC. In 2023, the DRC reported more than 14,000 suspected cases (three times as many as in 2022) and over 500 deaths from mpox. In 2024, these trends have accelerated, and in only the first half of this year, the country has [reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e84jw9qdjo) over 14,000 suspected cases across 23 different provinces, with over 450 deaths. Children have been heavily affected in the DRC outbreaks, with an [estimated](https://apnews.com/article/what-is-mpox-monkey-pox-congo-emergency-415d11f9e62d104b4c40dd8fe8e80b47) 70% of mpox cases and 85% of mpox deaths in the country since 2022 occurring in children under 15.\n\nMoreover, the emergence and rapid spread of a new strain of the mpox virus (known as [clade Ib](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3); see Box 1) that “appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks” was first identified in eastern DRC in 2023 has not only caused a growing number of cases in the DRC, it has been found in a number of other countries in the region and outside Africa with one case detected in [Sweden](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gqr5lrpwxo) and one in [Thailand](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-08-27/Thailand-confirms-mpox-case-is-clade-1b-second-outside-Africa-1woV9vm7uUM/p.html). There are concerns that clade Ib virus may be more readily transmissible (including via sexual contact) compared to clade Ia, which could be contributing to the increased numbers of cases and the cross-border spread of the disease.\n\n### What has been the global response to the current mpox emergency?\n\nAlongside its PHEIC declaration on August 14, WHO [released](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern) $1.45 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to help scale up the response in affected countries. On August 26, WHO issued a [Global Mpox Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP)](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan) that outlined a set of global, regional, and country level response steps and needs to address the spread of clade Ib in eastern DRC and to control outbreaks of clades I and II in the DRC and other African countries. The plan emphasized the need for better mpox surveillance, strengthening clinical care for the disease, more global cooperation to increase vaccine access, implementation of strategic vaccination efforts in populations at highest risk, and public health communication efforts and community empowerment.\n\nAlong with its declaration on August 13, Africa CDC requested $20 million for immediate mpox response needs (and reported it had been granted [$10.4 million](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mpox-vaccines-likely-months-away-even-who-africa-cdc-discuss-emergency-2024-08-14/)) from the African Union, and initially requested an additional $16 million from WHO and other international partners for a continent-wide response. The Africa CDC and WHO also launched a joint plan, the [Mpox Continental Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa](https://africacdc.org/download/mpox-continental-preparedness-and-response-plan-for-africa/), covering the September 2024 through February 2025 period identifying the following:\n\n- 10 “pillars” for the continental response including coordination and leadership, case management, vaccination, and logistics and financing;\n- roles and responsibilities for the primary international organizations involved in the response, including Africa CDC, WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and UNICEF;\n- the need for approximately $600 million to address the outbreak on the continent during the plan period (with 55% to be allocated to the mpox response in 14 affected countries and to boost readiness in 15 other countries at risk and 45% to be allocated to operational and technical support through partners), calling on donor governments, philanthropic organizations, and the private sector to provide this funding. Recent pledges from the U.S. and other donors totalled\n\nIn addition, Africa CDC [activated](https://africacdc.org/news-item/mpox-response-plan-envisions-support-across-22-countries/) its Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC), initiated negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers and others to obtain mpox vaccines for use in outbreak response on the continent (see Box 2 for more on mpox vaccines), began supporting laboratory testing capacity building for mpox, and deployed epidemiologists to affected areas, among other activities.\n\n### Are mpox vaccines available, and are they getting to affected countries quickly?\n\nThere are several vaccines that can be used to prevent mpox (see Box 2). Africa CDC and WHO consider vaccines to be a key prevention tool for the response, and the joint Africa CDC and WHO continental response plan calls for enough vaccine doses to vaccinate 10 million people in African countries from September 2024 through February 2025. However, there are a limited number of vaccine doses available other than those already stockpiled by high-income countries.\n\nSome high-income countries have agreed to donate vaccine doses from their existing stockpiles in support of the global response. For example, the European Commission [announced](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/mpox-hera-donate-over-215000-vaccine-doses-africa-cdc-amid-urgent-outbreak-2024-08-14_en) a donation of 175,000 doses to Africa CDC, and Japan [agreed](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/08/20/mpox-cases-on-the-rise-in-dr-congo-as-nations-pledge-vaccines_6718522_4.html) to donate up to 3.5 million doses for response in the DRC. The U.S. has [pledged](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-donate-1-million-mpox-vaccine-doses-halt-outbreak-africa-2024-09-24/) to provide 1 million doses for the response, and has already delivered 50,000 doses to the DRC and [10,000 doses](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/nigeria-receives-10000-doses-mpox-vaccines-us-2024-08-29/) to Nigeria (see more on the U.S. role in mpox response below). In addition, Bavarian Nordic, the company that manufactures one of the mpox vaccines, pledged to donate 40,000 of the doses it has on hand to the DRC and to ramp up production of more doses for use in African countries in the coming months. Taken together, donors have pledged to provide a total of [over 5.4 million doses](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/donors-making-a-difference--united-against-mpox--swift-and-effective-response-in-action) of mpox vaccine for this response, according to WHO.\n\nUNICEF and Gavi are also assisting in the process of acquiring vaccine doses and implementing vaccination in affected areas. Gavi [announced](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/15000-mpox-vaccine-doses-arrive-democratic-republic-congo) it would redirect $2.9 million in funding to support mpox vaccinations in the DRC, and also is talking with vaccine manufacturers to help purchase doses directly, using funds drawn from its [First Response Fund](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-day-zero-financing-could-help-protect-world-during-next-pandemic). Gavi is also helping coordinate the delivery of donated vaccines to countries in need. UNICEF [reports](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-scales-efforts-protect-children-mpox-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo) that it is providing vaccination supplies and logistics support, health worker trainings, transportation, storage, and vaccine administration in the country.\n\nAs of September 24, 2024, 250,000 doses – [200,000 doses](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mpox-vaccines-outbreak-congo-cases-death-toll-rising-fast/) from the European Commission and Bavarian Nordic, along with the [50,000 doses](https://www.usaid.gov/democratic-republic-congo/press-release/sep-11-2024-50000-doses-mpox-vaccines-donated-united-states-arrived-today-kinshasa) from the U.S. – have arrived in the DRC. However, this is just a [small fraction of the over 3 million doses](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mpox-vaccines-outbreak-congo-cases-death-toll-rising-fast/) that health authorities say are needed in the country in the near term. The DRC government [announced](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/congo-brings-forward-launch-mpox-vaccine-drive-oct-2-2024-09-11/) it expects mpox vaccinations to begin in the country in the first week of October.\n\nIn other nearby countries reporting recent clade I mpox cases (such as Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda), there is little information so far about if mpox vaccines will be provided in-country and when vaccinations may begin.\n\nBox 2: Mpox vaccines and the international response\n\nThere are three [vaccines](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/378522/WER9934-eng-fre.pdf), initially developed for smallpox prevention, that are considered effective in preventing mpox infection:\n\n- **MVA-BN:** Also known under the brand names Jynneos, Imvamune, and Imvanex, it is manufactured by Bavarian Nordic in Denmark and licensed by a number of countries for use in adults for the prevention of mpox.1 The MVA-BN vaccine is administered in a two-dose series.\n- **ACAM2000:** Manufactured by Emergent in the U.S., it has been made available for mpox prevention in adults under expanded access by the FDA in the U.S. The ACAM2000 vaccine is administered as a single dose.\n- **LC16m8:** Manufactured by KM Biologics in Japan, it has been licensed by Japan for smallpox prevention in children and adults and authorized by Japan for use against mpox since 2022. The LC16m8 vaccine is administered as a single dose.\n\nAfrica CDC has primarily focused on acquiring MVA-BN and LC16m8 doses for African countries, and estimates that enough doses to vaccinate 10 million people on the continent are needed.1 In the U.S., a [2022](https://www.fda.gov/media/160774/download) [emergency use authorization](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#monkeypoxvaccines) issued by the FDA allows for the use of MVA-BN (JYNNEOS) vaccine in children and adolescents under some circumstances. WHO representatives have [stated](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/africa-launches-single-mpox-response-plan-as-drc-prepares-to-get-vaccine-donations-to-hotspots/) that the same vaccine could be used “off label” to vaccinate children and adolescents on the African continent during the current emergency response.\n\n### What assistance has the U.S. provided to the DRC for mpox response?\n\nThe U.S. government has long provided support to help DRC address mpox. For example, CDC has [supported](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/outbreak/2023-drc.html) mpox research and response efforts in country for decades. Over the last few years, U.S. support for mpox response has included [efforts](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a3.htm) to build laboratory testing capacity in-country, conduct mpox vaccine research, and training health care workers.\n\nWith the growth in mpox cases in the DRC and the emergency declarations from Africa CDC and WHO, the U.S. government has [announced](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/14/united-states-governments-response-clade-i-mpox-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo-other-countries-region.html) a number of additional actions. This includes a U.S. [commitment](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0822-mpox-outbreak.html) to provide over $55 million in emergency health assistance through USAID and the U.S. CDC for mpox response in DRC and other affected countries in Africa, including $10 million in additional funding [announced](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo) in August specifically for clade I mpox response efforts. Also, the U.S. [donated](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/nigeria-receives-10000-doses-mpox-vaccines-us-2024-08-29/) 10,000 doses of mpox vaccine to Nigeria in August and [delivered](https://www.usaid.gov/democratic-republic-congo/press-release/sep-11-2024-50000-doses-mpox-vaccines-donated-united-states-arrived-today-kinshasa) 50,000 doses of mpox vaccine to the DRC in September, along with additional support for vaccine delivery.\n\nOn September 24, President Biden [stated](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-donate-1-million-mpox-vaccine-doses-halt-outbreak-africa-2024-09-24/) the U.S. would increase its support over the coming months, and expects to [provide](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/24/fact-sheet-the-united-states-commitment-to-address-the-global-mpox-outbreak/) over $500 million in additional assistance for the mpox response in African countries as well as donate as many as [1 million mpox vaccines](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/09/24/hhs-announces-mpox-vaccine-donations-boosting-domestic-and-international-supply.html) in support of the response.\n\nBesides its mpox-specific support, the U.S. government has also long provided significant amounts of global health and humanitarian assistance to the country, and recently [stated](https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo) it would be expanding assistance for broad humanitarian efforts in the DRC.\n\n### What are key challenges in responding to the current mpox emergency?\n\nAddressing the current mpox emergency in the DRC and other affected countries in Africa poses a number of [challenges](https://www.who.int/news/item/19-08-2024-first-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-upsurge-of-mpox-2024), including:\n\n- **Limited testing, surveillance, and epidemiological capacity.** There is a lack of point of care testing and laboratory capacity in many affected areas, which means many suspected cases of mpox may be undiagnosed and suspected cases unconfirmed. This is particularly true in regard to genomic sequencing. This hampers epidemiological investigations and leaves many questions unanswered about the current state of mpox in the DRC and elsewhere. More testing and epidemiological information on modes of disease transmission, risk factors, and disease severity associated with the different MPXV clades, as well as outcomes of pregnancy in women infected with different MPXV clades, would help authorities target response efforts.\n- **Difficulties with obtaining and distributing mpox vaccines at scale.** There is currently a limited global supply of mpox vaccines, with many of the existing doses found only in national stockpiles of high-income countries so the response relies in large part on donations. Also, there is a lack of formal authorization to use these vaccines in a number of the affected countries in Africa and little data on the effectiveness of these vaccines against clade I mpox or their effectiveness in children. A new, large-scale vaccination campaign to reach the populations at greatest risk for mpox is also a challenge.\n- **Stigma and overlapping risks of mpox and HIV infection.** There are relatively high rates of HIV infection in some mpox-affected countries in Africa, which raises concerns about the potential overlap in risks between these infectious diseases. Unsuppressed HIV infection could raise the risk for mpox transmission, especially in the context of sexual contact, and for development of more severe outcomes from mpox infection. In addition, both infections can lead to stigma for those affected, making the response more challenging. Therefore, ensuring public health authorities plan to address HIV and mpox in a coordinated fashion will be important.\n- **Health systems and health care workforce.** Lack of access to health care and a limited health care workforce increase risks from mpox for individuals and communities. Linking mpox cases to health care services as early as possible and ensuring the health care workforce is adequately trained and supplied to address mpox improves outcomes.\n- **Travel restrictions.** To date, countries have not put into place harsh restrictions on travel to and from areas affected by this mpox emergency. However, if the outbreak worsens and spreads to more countries, there is the potential for countries to impose travel bans or other restrictions, as has occurred during past outbreaks. There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of such restrictions in interrupting international transmission of mpox.\n- **Competing priorities amid instability, conflict, and community distrust.** Many of the affected countries – the DRC in particular – face multiple simultaneous humanitarian crises, health emergencies, and other urgent issues in addition to mpox. This makes focusing attention on and implementing a response to mpox more challenging, especially in the context of limited resources. For example, in some affected areas in the DRC, there is a history of instability and conflict and an ongoing lack of trust in authorities in many communities, which complicates response and risk communication efforts particularly those focused on reaching the most at-risk populations.\n\n### How might this latest outbreak affect people in the U.S.?\n\nAlthough cases of mpox due to clade II infections continue to occur in the U.S. (see below), so far no cases of mpox due to clade I infections – the genetic family linked to the current DRC outbreak – have been identified in the U.S. The U.S. CDC [estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-risk-assessment.html) that the risk to the general public from the current mpox outbreak in African countries remains very low. The CDC also estimates there is a low to moderate risk from the current DRC-based clade I outbreak for U.S. gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner as well as for people who have sex with MSM, regardless of gender, particularly if there is a history of travel to any of the African countries affected in the current mpox emergency.\n\nIn light of the evolving mpox situation in parts of Africa and the potential risk of imported cases, CDC has issued a [travel warning](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/mpox-drc-neighboring-countries) for the DRC and has issued [several](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp) [health alerts](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) for U.S. clinicians, which provide guidance on prevention strategies and also suggest a “heightened index of suspicion” for mpox in patients recently arriving from affected areas in Africa who demonstrate signs and symptoms consistent with the disease.\n\nGiven the rise in anti-immigrant rhetoric and a history of charged debates about travelers entering the U.S. during health emergencies, there is the potential for mpox to become politicized this election year, especially if cases linked to the ongoing outbreaks in Africa are eventually identified in the U.S.\n\n### What is the status of ongoing mpox circulation in the U.S.?\n\nAs mentioned above, in 2022-2023, the U.S. had over 30,000 mpox cases during the global outbreak of clade II mpox, which had initially emerged from West African countries. While case numbers have declined in the U.S. since 2022, some clade II mpox cases continue to be identified, with CDC [reporting](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/response/2022/mpx-trends.html) 1,968 mpox (clade II) cases so far this year nationwide as of September 1, 2024. These cases have primarily occurred among adult gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) who have multiple sexual partners, especially men of color and with people with HIV being disproportionately impacted. [According to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7132e3.htm), during the peak of the epidemic in 2022 over 99% of mpox clade II cases in the U.S. occurred among men, and of those, 94% were among men who had sexual contact with other men.\n\nMore On\n\n[Global Health Policy](https://www.kff.org/topic/global-health-policy/) [International Cooperation](https://www.kff.org/tag/international-cooperation/) [Mpox](https://www.kff.org/tag/mpox/)\n\n## Also of Interest\n\n[**Global Disease Outbreaks: A 2025 Snapshot and Implications for the U.S.**](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/global-disease-outbreaks-a-2025-snapshot-and-implications-for-the-u-s/)\n\n[**The International Health Regulations and the U.S.: Implications of an Amended Agreement**](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-international-health-regulations-and-the-u-s-implications-of-an-amended-agreement/)\n\n[**The U.S. Government and the World Health Organization**](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-u-s-government-and-the-world-health-organization/)\n\n## More On\n\n- [Global Health Policy](https://www.kff.org/topic/global-health-policy/)\n- [International Cooperation](https://www.kff.org/tag/international-cooperation/)\n- [Mpox](https://www.kff.org/tag/mpox/)\n\n[View all Topics](https://www.kff.org/topics/)\n\n© 2025 KFF\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\n[Privacy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) \\- [Terms](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/)\n\nprotected by **reCAPTCHA**\n\nreCAPTCHA is changing its terms of service.
