When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

In 2023, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles. Right now, measles outbreaks are happening in every region of the world. Anyone who is not protected against measles can get measles while abroad and easily spread it to others when they return home.\n\nAlthough measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States due to unvaccinated international travelers. Large measles outbreaks are possible when travel-related measles cases reach at-risk U.S. populations with low immunization against measles. In 2019, the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status with [almost 1,300 measles cases from a large outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research) in New York and cases in 30 additional states. After a decrease in global measles incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles activity globally and in the United States continues to rise.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Cases and Outbreaks in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)\n\n## Top 10 countries with measles outbreaks\n\n| Country | Number of Cases |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yemen | 17,059 |\n| Mongolia | 12,197 |\n| Pakistan | 11,463 |\n| Nigeria | 10,959 |\n| India | 8,035 |\n| Indonesia | 7,419 |\n| Russian Federation | 4,573 |\n| Mexico | 4,550 |\n| Afghanistan | 4,525 |\n| Canada | 3,844 |\n\nSource: World Health Organization\n\nThis table is based on provisional monthly surveillance data reported to the World Health Organization (Geneva) as of October 2025.

As of April 17, a total of 800 cases have been reported in the United States in 2025; 654 (82%) cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas have been associated with the ongoing outbreak. These cases represent an approximately 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024, and the second highest annual case count in the United States in 25 years. Overall, 771 (96%) patients have been unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status (77% were unvaccinated, and 14% had unknown vaccination status when excluding 590 cases reported by Texas, which requires explicit consent by law \\[i.e., opt-in\\] to enroll in the Texas Immunization Registry), 85 (11%) patients have been hospitalized, and three patients have died. Among 48 (6%) internationally imported cases, 44 (92%) occurred among U.S. residents. Endemic measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 as a direct result of high 2-dose childhood coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur when travelers with measles return to the United States while they are infectious; larger U.S. outbreaks typically follow importation into close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage. Nationally, risk for widespread measles transmission remains low because of high population-level immunity. To prepare for and prevent measles cases and outbreaks, public health departments should continue working with trusted community messengers on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and other community infection prevention approaches (e.g., case isolation, contact monitoring, and post-exposure prophylaxis) and coordinating with health care facilities and schools. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#)\n\n## Introduction\n\nMeasles is the most highly contagious febrile rash illness, infecting up to 90% of susceptible close contacts and resulting in serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Among the 4,056 measles cases reported in the United States during 2001–2022, a total of 727 (18%) were hospitalized, and three deaths were reported\\*; of the 727 hospitalized patients, 473 (65%) were unvaccinated, and 187 (26%) had unknown vaccination status ( _1_). Worldwide, measles vaccination is estimated to have saved 93.7 million lives during 1974–2024 and played a substantial role in reducing childhood mortality ( _2_) by preventing complications associated with measles and deaths from other infectious diseases as a consequence of measles-related immunosuppression ( _3_).\n\nEndemic measles transmission was declared eliminated† in the United States in 2000 after a change from a 1-dose to a 2-dose measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination schedule in 1989 ( _4_). However, a recent resurgence in global measles, resulting from COVID-19 pandemic–related challenges in implementing measles vaccination routine services and campaigns, has increased the risk for imported cases and outbreaks in the United States, particularly when U.S. travelers are exposed to measles abroad and return to the United States while they are infectious ( _5_). Although the United States still benefits from high population immunity from routine MMR vaccination, declining immunization rates among school-aged children and communities with already low vaccination coverage threaten a resurgence of measles, along with its potentially serious associated complications. For this report, CDC used national surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of measles cases and outbreaks reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#)\n\n## Methods\n\n### Data Source and Case Classification\n\nState health departments notify CDC of confirmed measles cases§ ( _6_) through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and directly (by email or telephone) to the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Measles vaccination status is ascertained by health departments during each case investigation; patients with written or electronic documentation of receipt of ≥1 dose of a measles-containing vaccine ≥14 days before rash onset are considered vaccinated, and all other patients are classified as unvaccinated or as having unknown measles vaccination status.¶ Measles cases are classified by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists as internationally imported if 1) at least part of the exposure period (7–21 days before rash onset) occurred outside the United States, 2) rash onset occurred within 21 days of entering the United States, and 3) no known exposure to measles occurred in the United States. All other cases are classified as U.S.-acquired ( _6_). For this analysis, patients with imported measles cases were classified as age-eligible for vaccination if they were aged ≥6 months and were not vaccinated according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations ( _4_).\n\n### Analysis of Outbreaks\n\nA measles outbreak was defined as the occurrence of three or more epidemiologically linked\\*\\* cases. Unique measles virus sequences are defined as those differing by at least one nucleotide in the N-450 sequence (i.e., the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminal 150 nucleoprotein amino acids) based on standard World Health Organization recommendations for describing sequence variants†† ( _7_). Patients with confirmed vaccine reactions (i.e., rash caused by a reaction to vaccine strain virus) were not included as persons with measles cases, as studies have found no confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission of the measles vaccine strain virus ( _6_). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#)\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of Reported Measles Cases\n\nDuring January 1–April 17, 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported in 25 U.S. jurisdictions ( [Figure 1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#F1_down)). The highest number of weekly cases (99) was reported during the week ending March 22 ( [Figure 2](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#F2_down)). Median patient age was 9 years (IQR = 4–23 years); 249 (31%) patients were aged <5 years, 304 (38%) were aged 5–19 years, 231 (29%) were aged ≥20 years, and age was unknown for 16 (2%) patients ( [Table](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#T1_down)). Among all measles patients, 771 (96%) were unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, 10 (1%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and 19 (2%) had received 2 doses. For Texas cases, it was not possible to disaggregate unvaccinated patients from those with unknown vaccination status because the Texas Immunization Registry requires explicit consent by law (i.e., opt-in) to enroll. Among 210 measles patients (excluding 590 cases reported by Texas), 162 (77%) were unvaccinated, six (3%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, 12 (6%) had received 2 doses, and the vaccination status of 30 (14%) was unknown. Among all 800 cases, 790 (99%) occurred among U.S. residents. Overall, 85 (11%) patients were hospitalized; 56 (66%) of those were unvaccinated, one (1%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and the vaccination status of 28 (33%) was unknown. Three measles deaths were reported to CDC; two confirmed in Texas in unvaccinated school-aged children with no known underlying medical conditions, and one confirmed in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. Most cases (557; 70%) were laboratory-confirmed; among 251 (31%) cases from which specimens were available for molecular sequencing, all were confirmed as wild-type virus strain with 225 (90%) identified as genotype D8 and 26 (10%) as genotype B3.\n\n### International Importations\n\nForty-eight (6%) cases were directly imported from other countries, including 44 (92%) among U.S. residents who had traveled abroad; 752 (94%) cases were U.S.-acquired. Fifteen (31%) importations resulted in secondary cases. Among the 48 internationally imported measles cases, 33 (69%) patients were unvaccinated, one (2%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, four (8%) had received 2 doses, and the vaccination status of 10 (21%) patients was unknown. All 33 of the unvaccinated persons with imported measles were age-eligible for vaccination per ACIP, including 10 infant travelers aged 6–11 months. Source countries of the 48 imported measles cases included Canada (10 cases), Vietnam (10), Mexico (seven), Pakistan (three), the Philippines (two), Saudi Arabia (two), and one imported case each from Afghanistan, Australia, Guinea, Netherlands, Somalia, Spain, and Uganda; a source country could not be determined for seven travelers who visited multiple countries during their exposure period: Tanzania and United Arab Emirates (two cases); China, Japan, and Vietnam (one); France, South Korea, and Vietnam (one); Thailand and Vietnam (one); Indonesia and the Philippines (one); and Southeast Asia (one).\n\n### Measles Outbreaks\n\nTen measles outbreaks have been reported in 2025¶¶; 751 (94%) of all reported confirmed measles cases were outbreak-associated. An imported source was identified for seven outbreaks, and the source of three outbreaks remains unknown. Outbreak-related cases have been reported in 12 states (Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas). The largest outbreak began among a close-knit community with low vaccination coverage in Gaines County, Texas in January 2025 and has accounted for 654 (82%) cases reported during 2025 (584 patients in 24 Texas counties, 63 patients in four New Mexico counties, and seven patients in northeastern Oklahoma); the source of this outbreak remains unknown. Thirty-seven confirmed cases in Kansas are suspected to be linked to this outbreak. In addition, an expanding outbreak in Chihuahua, Mexico\\*\\*\\* began in late February after a Mexican resident became infected after reported travel to Gaines County, Texas. All 208 genotyped specimens obtained from measles patients in Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas were genotype D8, 196 (94%) of which had identical N-450 sequences; 12 differed by one nucleotide, which can be expected in prolonged outbreaks.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#)\n\n## Discussion\n\nA total of 800 measles cases and 10 outbreaks were reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025, representing approximately a 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024. Most cases have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n\nOverall, 11% of measles patients have been hospitalized, and three deaths have been reported. Similar to previous years ( _1_), nearly all (96%) cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, and 77% of cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated when excluding cases reported by Texas. Most (92%) imported cases occurred among U.S. residents returning to the United States while infectious and from all six World Health Organization regions. Adherence to standard measles control measures, including isolation and quarantine, as well as high vaccination coverage locally, prevented secondary transmission from most of these persons who were infectious after returning from travel abroad.\n\nMost cases reported during 2025 have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, resulting in the second largest outbreak in the United States since elimination was declared in 2000. During 2001–2023, approximately 90% of U.S. measles outbreaks with 50 or more cases occurred in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage ( _8_). Such communities might have frequent communal gatherings and have concerns about engaging with public health and health care systems for testing, treatment, and vaccination. The United States, Canada,††† and Mexico are all experiencing large, expanding outbreaks in similar interconnected communities. Frequent travel among similar communities across multiple states and countries might facilitate the rapid spread of measles outbreaks. The risk for widespread measles transmission in the United States remains low because of high population immunity resulting from high measles vaccination coverage. However, recent increasing global measles incidence in areas frequently visited by U.S. travelers, coupled with declines in MMR vaccination coverage in many U.S. jurisdictions to <95% (the estimated population-level immunity necessary to prevent measles outbreaks), and spread of measles from ongoing domestic outbreaks to other jurisdictions, have increased the risk for ongoing measles transmission within the United States ( _8_, _9_).\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, imported cases were likely underreported because 30% of reported outbreaks had no known source. Second, outbreak-related cases were likely underreported because certain persons in affected communities might not engage with the health care and public health systems. Third, distinguishing unvaccinated patients from patients with unknown measles vaccination status in Texas was not possible; the Texas Immunization Registry legally requires explicit consent, or opt-in, for adults and by parent or guardian for children to enroll.§§§ Persons with no records available are considered to have an unverified vaccination history. Finally, definitive linkages between the large outbreak in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas and cases reported in Kansas could not be identified.\n\n### Implications for Public Health Practice\n\nTo protect against measles and its complications before traveling internationally, all persons aged ≥12 months should have documented receipt of 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine, and infants aged 6–11 months of age should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine ( _10_). Persons residing in or traveling domestically to outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance, which is developed based on review and analysis of the local outbreak epidemiology ( _6_). Infants aged <6 months are at high risk for measles complications but are too young to be vaccinated, and therefore depend upon population immunity and passively transferred maternal measles antibodies (from previously vaccinated or infected mothers) to prevent infections and related complications.\n\nHealth care providers continue to serve on the front lines to identify measles cases, alert public health departments¶¶¶, ensure recommended testing, and implement measles isolation precautions to prevent health care–associated and community-based transmission. Health care providers should consider measles in the differential diagnosis for all patients (especially those who are unvaccinated) who 1) have fever (temperature ≥101°F \\[≥38.3°C\\]) and a generalized maculopapular rash with cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis, 2) have recently traveled outside the country or to a U.S. region with a known measles outbreak, or 3) have other known or suspected exposure to measles ( _6_). Although no specific Food and Drug Administration–approved antiviral therapy for measles exists, rapid access to supportive care can help relieve symptoms and treat complications such as pneumonia and secondary bacterial and viral infections. Providers should also offer and encourage vaccination for eligible patients who lack presumptive evidence of immunity to measles ( _4_).\n\nPublic health departments might benefit from using a CDC checklist\\*\\*\\*\\* to help guide their readiness activities such as preparing for laboratory testing and data reporting needs, conducting tabletop exercises, and facilitating early engagement with communities with low vaccination coverage and their trusted messengers before measles and other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks occur. To identify communities at risk, public health departments should consider using both MMR vaccination coverage data from immunization information systems and kindergarten entry and vaccination exemption data from kindergarten entry records. Standard measles control interventions, including vaccination, isolation, quarantine, and postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., administration of MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure for certain persons) ( _10_), might be challenging to implement in certain communities. Therefore, public health departments should consider partnering with trusted community messengers (e.g., clinicians and religious leaders) on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and potentially acceptable community infection control approaches. Coordination with health care facilities, early childhood education facilities and schools, and other congregate settings that surround or serve these communities to prepare for measles cases regarding appropriate infection prevention and control, testing, public health follow-up, and early childhood education or school exclusion policies is crucial to limit transmission. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#)\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nMichael Thomas, CDC; Sierrah Haas, Allison Zaldivar, Kansas Department of Health and Environment; Chad Smelser, New Mexico Department of Health; Anna Marie McSpadden, Ashlyn Wayman, Oklahoma State Department of Health.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm#)\n\nCorresponding author: Adria D.

The U.S. has now confirmed [1,596 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest annual number [in more than three decades](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health).\n\nBut the true total could be even higher, says [Dr. Paul Offit](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a), director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\"If you talk to people on the ground, including not only in Texas, but other states, they all say the same thing, which is that the numbers are much worse than that. Probably closer to 5,000 cases,\" Offit says. \"And it's not done.\"\n\nHe points to the current outbreak in South Carolina, where 139 schoolchildren at two schools are now subject to a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The state Department of Public Health on Tuesday [reported its 16th measles](https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-16-total-2025-12-related-upstate) case since July, including 12 cases directly linked to an ongoing outbreak in Spartanburg County.\n\n[![Routine childhood vaccination rates have been dropping across the U.S. and vaccine-preventable childhood diseases have been rising.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1414x1414+543+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2F92%2F8c8c7286468ab47e022ef7d65d23%2Fgettyimages-1313998982-1.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5188676/trump-election-2024-vaccines-rfk)\n\n### [Shots - Health News](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/)\n\n### [What happens when a vaccine skeptic leads health policy? Ask Florida](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5188676/trump-election-2024-vaccines-rfk)\n\n\"There is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring,\" [Dr. Linda Bell](https://studysc.org/sc-people/linda-bell), South Carolina's state epidemiologist, told reporters during a [briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g) last week. She said that makes it vital that the public receive the recommended measles vaccination.\n\nMeanwhile, a large measles outbreak along the border areas of Arizona and southwestern Utah continues to grow, with Utah now [reporting 56 cases](https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/) this year as of Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated. Six people required hospitalization. According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, wastewater testing shows that the measles virus is more widespread in the state than previously known.\n\nIn neighboring Arizona, officials have reported [77 cases](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php) so far this year as of Tuesday — including 14 new cases since last week.\n\nAnd in Minnesota, officials last week reported that a small, recent surge in measles cases there has brought the state's [total for the year to 20](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/stats.html).\n\nAll told, the CDC [has confirmed](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) 44 measles outbreaks in 41 states this year. The agency defines an outbreak as three or more cases that are linked.The vast majority of cases were in people who were unvaccinated; 27% percent have been in children under the age of 5. About 1 in 8 measles cases have resulted in hospitalization.\n\n### Widespread vaccination in the U.S. has saved hundreds of lives each year\n\nMeasles is one of the most [contagious diseases](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread) known to humans. On average, an infected person will infect as many as 18 other unvaccinated people. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left a room. That's why it's so highly transmissible.\n\nBefore widespread vaccination, pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 people in the U.S. used to die from it each year.\n\n[![A person enters a CVS store in Monterey Park, California,  where flu and COVID-19 vaccines are offered. ](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5312x5312+1937+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fe5%2F0ed7355d4925837197c6108f9630%2Fgettyimages-2237018794.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation)\n\n### [Living Better](https://www.npr.org/series/1176326550/living-better)\n\n### [The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation)\n\nThe disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. To protect communities against outbreaks, they need a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC.\n\nNationwide, measles vaccination rates have been slipping for years — [they're currently at 92.5%](https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html). The trend predates the current administration, but Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, says it doesn't help that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long history of criticizing vaccines. Ratner notes that acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill has suggested breaking up the standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine [into three separate shots](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation), which Ratner says is neither feasible nor is it backed by evidence.\n\nIn a statement to NPR on Tuesday, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, \"Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,\" and wants to ensure that vaccines \"are backed by gold standard science.\" He added, \"Secretary Kennedy has been outspoken in his support for the measles vaccine.\"\n\nKennedy [endorsed the measles vaccine](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury) earlier this year. But senators from both parties have [accused Kennedy of undermining vaccine access and politicizing vaccines](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5528966/rfk-kennedy-hearing-covid-vaccines-cdc) with his approach to vaccine policy.\n\n\"It's no wonder that parents are, you know, confused and frightened,\" says Ratner, the author of _Booster Shots_, a history of the fight against measles and its recent resurgence.\n\nIn some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower than the national average. That's created pockets of opportunity for measles to spread, Ratner says.\n\n\"If a measles case comes into a place with a low vaccination rate, it can really take off,\" Ratner says. \"That's what we saw in Gaines County\" — the epicenter of the Texas outbreak that saw [762 cases and two deaths](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak) — \"and that's what we're seeing in lots of places.\"\n\n- [measles](https://www.npr.org/tags/136620805/measles)\n\n- **Facebook**\n- **Flipboard**\n- **Email**\n\n![NPR Plus logo](https://prod-eks-static-assets.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-plus/npr-plus-combo-logo.svg)\n\n##### Exclusive benefits\n\n###### Give a little.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.\n\nPeople who live in or visit the counties in the outbreak counties listed above should follow the [outbreak vaccination recommendations](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-infographic.pdf).\n\nTo get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the [measles outbreak page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles) to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.\n\nAdditional information for the public and health care providers is available at the links below:\n\n[Measles Outbreak page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles)\n\n[Measles FAQ page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Jan. 30 Announcing Cases in Gaines County](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/state-health-officials-urge-vigilance-additional-measles-cases-are-identified)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Feb. 25 Outbreak Update](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/dshs-provides-update-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Feb. 26 Texas Announces First Death in Measles Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS News Release – April 6 Texas Announces Second Death in Measles Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – Feb. 5 Gaines County Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – Feb. 24 Measles Exposures in South & Central Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-exposures-central-south-central-texas)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – March 6 Measles Outbreak Case Definition](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-case-definition)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – April 7 Texas 2025 Measles Outbreak – Expanded Outbreak Counties](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-texas-2025-measles-outbreak-expanded-outbreak-counties)\n\n## Data\n\n[School Coverage](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage)\n\n[Conscientious Exemptions](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions)\n\n[Measles (Rubeola) Data \\| Texas DSHS](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola/measles-rubeola/measles-rubeola-data)\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other 2025 Texas Measles Cases**\n\n| County | Cases |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bell | 1 |\n| Bexar | 1 |\n| Brazoria | 1 |\n| Collin | 3 |\n| Dallas | 1 |\n| Denton | 2 |\n| El Paso | 2 |\n| Fort Bend | 1 |\n| Harris | 5 |\n| Harrison | 1 |\n| Hays | 1 |\n| Midland | 1 |\n| Randall | 2 |\n| Rockwall | 1 |\n| Scurry | 1 |\n| Shackelford | 1 |\n| Tarrant | 4 |\n| Travis | 2 |\n| Williamson | 8 |\n| **Total** | **39** |\n\n2025 Texas Measles Cases Not Associated with the Outbreak in West Texas\n\nCases on this table may be moved to the West Texas outbreak dashboard if further investigation indicates a connection to the outbreak.\n\nSubscribe to our email list\n\nSign up to receive DSHS email and text updates\n\n[Sign up for Updates](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXHHSC/subscriber/new?topic_id=TXHHSC_85 \"\")",

Of note, 92% of case-patients are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, 4% have only one measles, mumps, and rubella dose, and 4% were fully vaccinated.\n\nTwelve percent of cases have required hospitalization, with 29% of those hospitalized aged 19 years or younger. There have been 3 confirmed measles deaths this year.\n\n### **Georgia reports 3 new cases**\n\nGeorgia's health department reported three more measles infections with links to its most recent case; two patients were unvaccinated and one had an unknown vaccination status. Georgia now has 10 confirmed cases in 2025. In 2024, Georgia officials reported six cases.\n\nFinally, as many as 11 babies exposed to measles in Utah were given postexposure prophylaxis (prevention) after four cases were identified in the Bear River Health Department's jurisdiction.\n\n[The infants](https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/northern-utah/bear-river-health-department-treats-11-unvaccinated-infants-after-measles-exposure \"(opens in a new window)\") under 1 year of age, who cannot be vaccinated, were administered an immunoglobulin that provides short-term immunity.\n\n# Ebola outbreak in DR Congo adds 11 new cases in past week\n\nNews brief\n\nSeptember 24, 2025\n\n[Mary Van Beusekom, MS](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mary-van-beusekom-ms)\n\nTopics\n\n[Ebola](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola)\n\n![Nurse helping aid worker don personal protective equipment](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/Ebola%20tx%20unit-UNMEER%20(1).jpg)_UNMEER, Martine Perret / Flickr cc_\n\nEleven new Ebola virus cases have been added to the [outbreak](https://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/8439813c-2dfb-4220-8853-3e64dc300bf6/content \"(opens in a new window)\") in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the past week, pushing the case total to 57, including 35 deaths, for a death rate of 61.4%, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported yesterday.\n\nFirst declared on [September 4](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/dr-congo-declares-ebola-outbreak-kasai-province), the outbreak is still confined to the Bulape Health Zone in Kasai Province. Of the 57 cases, 47 were confirmed, and 10 were probable; of the 35 deaths, 25 were confirmed, and 10 were probable. Five of the confirmed cases were diagnosed in healthcare workers.\n\nEbola, which spreads through infected blood and other body fluids, typically causes fever and weakness, followed by diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n### **Children account for 23% of all infections**\n\nInfected patients range in age from 0 to 65 years, with those 0 to 9 years making up 23% of all cases. While females account for most cases (61%), their death rate is lower than that of males (56% vs 73%).\n\n> No international traffic-related measures are currently warranted.\n\n\"The outbreak shows a decreasing trend of cases in the recent week, nevertheless the attention remains high, and response activities are ongoing in all affected health areas including early case detection, isolation, case management, contact tracing, vaccination as well as risk communication and community engagement,\" the WHO wrote.\n\nAs of September 21, investigators have identified 1,180 contacts for follow-up. Of all contacts, 94 completed 21 days of monitoring, while the rest are still being tracked. Of 26 patients admitted to the Ebola Treatment Centre since the outbreak began, 2 recovered and were released on September 16, 5 died, and 19 are still being treated.\n\nIn total, 1,740 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the Bulape, Bulambae, and Mweka Health Zones in the 9 days since the campaign began.\n\n\"No international traffic-related measures are currently warranted,\" the statement said. Health authorities are reinforcing surveillance at border crossings through activities such as health screening, risk communication, and the integration of border communities in affected areas into early warning systems and the national surveillance network, it added.\n\n# Michigan reaches 16 CWD-positive counties with addition of Genesee\n\nNews brief\n\nSeptember 24, 2025\n\n[Mary Van Beusekom, MS](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mary-van-beusekom-ms)\n\nTopics\n\n[Chronic Wasting Disease](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chronic-wasting-disease)\n\n![White-tailed buck in woods](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/Curious%20white-tailed%20deer.jpg)James Marvin Phelps / Flickr\n\nGenesee County, Michigan, has become the state's 16th county positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in wild deer, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) [reported](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/MIDNR/bulletins/3f406bb \"(opens in a new window)\") today.\n\nGenesee County is in the southeastern part of the state's Lower Peninsula. The case was identified in an emaciated 2.5-year-old doe that was continuously drinking water and walked directly up to the responding conservation officer.\n\n\"Genesee County was under focused CWD surveillance in 2022, when approximately 300 deer were tested, with none testing positive,\" the press release said. \"The DNR has continued to test deer that appear sick in Genesee County when possible.\"\n\n### **State's first case in wild deer found in 2015**\n\n\"We appreciate the support and cooperation of the public as they continue to report sick deer so our team can follow up with the necessary testing for confirmation,\" Brent Rudolph, PhD, DNR deer, elk and moose management specialist, said in the release.\n\nSince CWD was first detected in Michigan wild deer in 2015, more than 110,000 deer have been tested for the disease in the state. In total, more than 144,000 wild deer have been tested since surveillance began in 2002, with 263 infected deer identified. Since direct hunter submissions of deer to the state's veterinary diagnostic laboratory began in 2020, more than 3,200 samples have yielded 56 additional confirmed cases.\n\nWe appreciate the support and cooperation of the public as they continue to report sick deer so our team can follow up with the necessary testing for confirmation.\n\nBrent Rudolph, PhD\n\nCWD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cervids such as deer, elk, and moose. Caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions, the disease has also been found in Clinton, Dickinson, Eaton, Gratiot, Hillsdale, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Jackson, Kent, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, Ogemaw, and Washtenaw counties.\n\nNo cases of CWD infection have been reported in people, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that infected animals not be consumed by people or domestic animals.\n\nThe DNR said deer remains should be taken to a landfill or disposed of through regular bagged trash pickup. Deer harvested from known CWD-positive areas should never be left on the landscape.\n\n# Outpatient antibiotic use in COVID patients linked to 'downstream' antibiotic resistance\n\nNews brief\n\nSeptember 24, 2025\n\n[Chris Dall, MA](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chris-dall-ma)\n\nTopics\n\n[Antimicrobial Stewardship](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship)\n\n![Gloved hand with pills](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/iStock-1286336605.jpg)Plyushkin / iStock\n\nA [study](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2400108 \"(opens in a new window)\") of more than 50,000 Canadian seniors diagnosed as having COVID-19 during the first 18 months of the pandemic found that antibiotic use within 7 days of diagnosis was associated with detection of antibiotic resistance organisms, researchers reported today in _NEJM Evidence._\n\nThe population-wide cohort study, led by researchers with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, analyzed data on residents of Ontario aged 66 years and older who had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021.\n\nBecause antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients was common in the early months of the pandemic in most countries, particularly in older patients, the researchers wanted to evaluate the relationship between peri–COVID-19 antibiotic exposure (within 7 days of index SARS-CoV-2 reporting) and isolation of an antibiotic-resistant organism from a clinical culture within 6 months.\n\nOf the 53,533 eligible patients included in the study, 8,228 (15%) were prescribed a peri–COVID-19 antibiotic, and 1,477 (3%) had a downstream drug-resistant organism identified. Peri–Covid-19 antibiotic use was significantly associated with the presence of any antibiotic-resistant organism (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\], 1.24; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.09 to 1.41) and the presence of gram-negative antibiotic-resistant organisms (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.46) but not gram-positive antibiotic-resistant organisms (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.48).\n\n### Stewardship in older adults, nursing home residents\n\nAmong all individuals who received an antibiotic, the attributable fraction of downstream antibiotic resistance related to peri–Covid-19 antibiotic use was 17% (95% CI, 7% to 26%). Among all individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the population-attributable fraction of downstream antimicrobial resistance related to peri–Covid-19 antibiotic use was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 7%).\n\n\"As antibiotics are often used in the outpatient setting in patients with Covid-19, without clear indications, this study suggests that a substantial burden of antimicrobial resistance in individuals with Covid-19 may have been avoidable,\" the study authors wrote\n\nThey add that the disproportionate impact on older, more vulnerable patients suggests that antimicrobial stewardship programs targeting antibiotic prescribing in older adults and those residing in nursing homes may be beneficial.\n\n# European Union launches One Health initiative for antimicrobial resistance\n\nNews

\"(opens in a new window)\") from the European Commission.\n\nThe One Health concept views the health of humans, animals, and the environment as interconnected.\n\nPlanned activities of OHAMR include strengthening research capacity in participating countries, supporting access to and better use of AMR data, promoting the translation of research into practice and policy, joint transnational calls for collaborative research and innovation projects, and coordinating and aligning national and European efforts to increase impact.\n\n\"Europe is ready to lead in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance,\" said Ekaterina Zaherieva, European Commissioner for Startups, Research and Innovation. \"This partnership embodies our commitment to step up, innovate, and protect

Dashboards are no longer being updated.\n\nHowever, due to ongoing activity in other states and countries, we anticipate that there will continue to be isolated cases of measles. Below are valuable guidance and resources about measles as well as how to obtain the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent this very contagious virus.\n\nFor questions about vaccinations, measles, or other health questions, please call the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773.)\n\n## Key points\n\n- From February to September 2025, New Mexico had a measles outbreak totaling 100 cases in nine counties with one death. It was New Mexico’s first measles outbreak since 1996, and its largest in decades.\n- Measles is very contagious and can be serious.\n- Two doses of MMR vaccine provide the best protection against measles. For anyone still wanting to be vaccinated, the MMR vaccine is still widely available in New Mexico.\n- Call the Department of Health Helpline at 1-833-796-8773:\n\n  - Ask questions about measles, vaccines or other medical questions.\n  - Guidance on measles exposures.\n  - Vaccination records.\n  - Reporting cases.\n- To access your vaccination record, click on the button below. If you have problems, call 1-833-882-6454.\n\n\n[Your Vaccination Records](https://vaxview.doh.nm.gov/)\n\n## Overview\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can cause fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads over the body. Serious complications can occur, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and even death.\n\nThe best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized against measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.\n\n## Reports\n\nBelow are two dashboards outlining measles cases during the 2025 outbreak as well as the number of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations statewide from February through September 2025, compared to the same time period in 2024. Tens of thousands of New Mexico residents got their MMR vaccinations over the course of the 2025 outbreak, at times nearly doubling the number of doses given during the same time period in 2024. This effort will provide community protection against measles in the years to come. Measles cases continue to be [reported nationwide to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.nmhealth.org/resource/view/2633/ \"\").\n\n### 2025 Measles Cases\n\nFeb 09Feb 16Feb 23Mar 02Mar 09Mar 16Mar 23Mar 30Apr 06Apr 13Apr 20Apr 27May 04May 11May 18May 25Jun 01Jun 08Jun 15Jun 22Jun 29Jul 06Jul 13Jul 20Jul 27Aug 03Aug 10Aug 17Aug 24Aug 31Sep 07Sep 14Sep 2102468101214\n\nMeasles Casesby WeekMeasles Cases\n\n[plotly-logomark](https://plotly.com/)\n\n##### \\*If date of rash not available, the following hierarchy is used for date: symptom onset date, specimen collection date, hospital admission date, or date reported.\n\n### Measles Cases by County  (as of 09/25/2025)  \\*If date of rash not available, the following hierarchy is used for date: symptom onset date, specimen collection date, hospital admission date, or date reported.\n\n[+](https://nmdoh-reports.shinyapps.io/Measles/_w_a970c4fd012c47959072774c1013e838/# \"Zoom in\") [−](https://nmdoh-reports.shinyapps.io/Measles/_w_a970c4fd012c47959072774c1013e838/# \"Zoom out\")\n\n1–5 cases\n\n6–10 cases\n\n11–20 cases\n\n21+ cases\n\n* * *\n\n>42 days since\n\nlast known case\n\nwas contagious\n\n#### If there are no new cases identified within 42 days after the last case in the county was contagious, it is very unlikely that there have been any additional infections associated with exposures to this case. Therefore, the risk of measles in the county is considered to be at the level of other counties without recent measles cases.\n\n### Measles Virus Detected in Wastewater  by Treatment Plant Site  (as

As of March 7, 2025, Texas and New Mexico have reported 208 confirmed cases associated with this outbreak (198 in [Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025) and 10 in [New Mexico](https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/)). As a part of this outbreak, two deaths have been reported: one in [Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak) and one in [New Mexico](https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188). More cases are expected as this outbreak continues to expand rapidly.\n\nWith spring and summer travel season approaching in the United States, CDC emphasizes the important role that clinicians and public health officials play in preventing the spread of measles. They should be vigilant for cases of febrile rash illness that meet the measles [case definition](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/measles-2013/) and share effective measles prevention strategies, including vaccination guidance for international travelers.\n\nThe risk for widespread measles in the United States remains low due to robust U.S. immunization and surveillance programs and outbreak response capacity supported by federal, state, tribal, local, and territorial health partners. [**Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination**](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html) **remains the most important tool for preventing measles**. To prevent measles infection and spread from imported cases, all U.S. residents should be up to date on their MMR vaccinations, especially before traveling internationally, regardless of the destination.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of March 6, 2025, a total of [222 measles cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) have been reported by twelve U.S. jurisdictions this year: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington; 201 of which occurred in New Mexico and Texas. Most of the 222 cases are among children who had not received the MMR vaccine. There have been three outbreaks, with an outbreak defined as three or more related cases, reported in 2025, and 93% of cases are outbreak-associated. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024 and 69% of cases were outbreak-associated.\n\n[Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html) is a highly contagious viral illness that typically begins with fever, cough, coryza (runny nose), and conjunctivitis (pink eye), lasting 2-4 days prior to [rash](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html) onset. Measles can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and death. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles virus can remain infectious in the air and on surfaces for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area.\n\nInfected people are contagious from 4 days before the rash starts through 4 days afterward. The incubation period for measles, from exposure to fever, is usually about 7–10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10–14 days (with a range of 7 to 21 days).\n\n## Recommendations for Healthcare Professionals\n\n- Ensure all patients without other evidence of immunity, especially those planning international travel, are up to date on [MMR vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html) per routine ACIP recommendations:\n  - Children are recommended to receive 2 doses of MMR. The first dose is given at 12–15 months of age and the second is given at 4–6 years of age before school entry.\n  - Infants 6 months of age or older can receive MMR prior to international travel or in outbreak settings (see below). MMR is not licensed for children <6 months of age.\n  - Adults not at high risk of exposure are recommended to have at least 1 documented dose of MMR in their lifetime, or other evidence of immunity (e.g., positive measles immunoglobulin G (IgG)). Adults at [high exposure risk](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/specific-groups.html), including students at post-secondary institutions, healthcare workers, and international travelers, should have two documented doses.\n- Ensure patients who reside in areas with an ongoing measles outbreak follow state and local guidance. [Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS)](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-case-definition) has issued the following recommendations for the affected counties in Texas:\n  - Infants 6 through 11 months receive an early dose of MMR vaccine (i.e., infant dose). Subsequent doses should follow CDC's recommended childhood schedule:\n    - Another dose at 12 through 15 months of age.\n    - A final dose at 4 through 6 years of age.\n  - Children older than 12 months who have not been vaccinated should receive one dose immediately and follow with a second dose at least 28 days after the first. Children older than 12 months with one prior dose should receive an early second dose of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.\n  - Teenagers and adults previously vaccinated with one dose of MMR vaccine should receive a second dose. Those with no [evidence of immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html) should receive one dose of MMR vaccine immediately and follow with a second dose at least 28 days later.\n- Ensure all U.S. residents older than age 6 months without [evidence of immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html) who are [traveling internationally](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fplan-for-travel.html) receive MMR vaccine prior to departure:\n  - Infants 6 through 11 months of age should receive one dose of MMR vaccine before departure. Infants who receive a dose of MMR vaccine before their first birthday should receive 2 more doses of MMR vaccine; the first of which should be administered when the child is 12 through 15 months of age and the second at least 28 days later (generally at age 4-6 years of age but can be administered sooner if indicated).\n  - Children 12 months of age or older should receive two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days.\n  - Teenagers and adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.\n- Be aware that some patients may develop a mild rash reaction in the 3 weeks following MMR vaccination. This does not typically require testing or public health intervention since a person with a rash due to a vaccine reaction is not infectious. If a symptomatic person who has been recently vaccinated also has a known or suspected measles exposure, consultation and additional testing may be required from the local or state health department to evaluate for acute measles.\n- Consider measles as a diagnosis in anyone with fever (≥101°F or 38.3°C) and a generalized maculopapular rash with cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis who has recently traveled internationally, or domestically to a region with a [known measles outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html), or has other known or suspected exposure to measles.\n- If you suspect measles:\n  - **Isolate:**\n    - [**Isolate patients with suspected measles**](https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/) **immediately,** ideally in a single-patient airborne infection isolation room (AIIR), or in a private room with a closed door until an AIIR is available. Patients with suspected measles should not remain in the waiting room or other common areas of a healthcare facility\n    - [Protect healthcare providers](https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/healthcare-personnel-epidemiology-control/measles.html) against measles by adhering to Standard and airborne precautions when evaluating confirmed or suspect cases, regardless of their vaccination status. Healthcare providers without presumptive evidence of measles immunity who are exposed to measles should be excluded from work from day 5 after the first exposure until day 21 following their last exposure and offered post-exposure prophylaxis, as appropriate.\n    - Healthcare systems should ensure all healthcare providers have presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, ensure they can rapidly retrieve healthcare provider immunization status in case of exposures and offer postexposure prophylaxis when indicated.\n    - Offer measles testing outside of facilities to avoid possible transmission in healthcare settings. Call ahead to ensure immediate isolation for patients referred to hospitals for a higher level of care.\n  - **Notify:** Immediately notify state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments ( [24-hour Epi On Call contact list](https://libraries.cste.org/after-hours-contact/)) about any suspected case of measles to ensure rapid testing and investigation. States report measles cases to CDC.\n  - **Test:** [Laboratory confirmation](https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/media/pdfs/2025/02/MMRV-Testing-for-Clinicians_Jan2025.pdf) should be pursued for all patients with suspected measles. CDC recommends collecting either a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or throat (OP) swab for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing as well as a blood specimen for serology testing from all patients with clinical features compatible with measles. Collecting a urine specimen along with an NP/OP swab may improve sensitivity of testing.\n  - **Manage:**\n    - [Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-post-exposure-prophylaxis-for-measles): In coordination with local or state health departments, provide appropriate measles PEP to close contacts without evidence of immunity, as soon as possible after exposure, either with MMR vaccine (within 72 hours) or immunoglobulin (within 6 days). The choice of PEP is based on elapsed time from exposure or medical contraindications to vaccination.\n    - **Supportive care**: There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles. Medical care is supportive to help relieve symptoms and address complications such as pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections. Consistent with guidance from the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/book/755/chapter/14079321/Measles), [vitamin A](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#cdc_clinical_overview_treat_pat-patient-management) may be administered to infants and children in the United States with measles as part of supportive management. Children with severe measles, such as those who are hospitalized, should be managed with vitamin A. Vitamin A should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare provider and is not a substitute for vaccination. [Overuse of Vitamin A can lead to toxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532916/) and cause damage to the liver, bones, central nervous system, and skin. Pregnant women should avoid taking high levels of vitamin A as it has been [linked to severe birth defects](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/reducing-risks-of-birth-defects).\n\n## Recommendations for State and Local Health Departments\n\nState and local health departments have the lead in investigating measles cases and outbreaks.\n\n- Report measles immediately (within 24 hours) to CDC ( [measlesreport@cdc.gov](mailto:measlesreport@cdc.gov)) and through the [National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/). Measles is a nationally notifiable disease.\n- Establish measles case reporting within hospitals and to public health authorities.\n- Record and report details about cases of measles, including close contacts and locations visited while infectious (i.e. 4 days before and after rash onset).\n- Conduct active surveillance for any additional cases and facilitate transportation of specimens immediately to confirm diagnosis if measles is identified.\n- Enhance outreach and communications to under-vaccinated communities through trusted messengers.\n- Consider utilizing state-based [syndromic surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/php/about/index.html) to monitor for changes with healthcare seeking behavior for febrile rash illness or vitamin A toxicity.\n\n## Recommendations for Domestic Travelers to Outbreak Areas and International Travelers\n\n- Talk to your doctor about the MMR vaccine, especially if you or your child plan to travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak or internationally. Two doses of MMR vaccine provide better protection (97%) against measles than one dose (93%).\n\n- Check your [destination](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) and CDC's [Global Measles Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/measles-globe) for more travel health advice if you plan to travel internationally, including countries measles outbreaks have been reported.\n- After domestic travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak or international travel, watch for signs and symptoms of measles for 3 weeks after returning to the United States. If you or your child gets sick with a rash and a high fever, call your healthcare provider. Tell them you traveled to an area where they identified measles or another country and whether you or your child had received MMR vaccine.\n\n## For More Information\n\n- [Clinical Overview of Measles \\| Measles (Rubeola) \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html)\n- [Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Measles in Healthcare Settings \\| Infection Control \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/measles/index.html)\n- [Chapter 7: Measles \\| Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases \\| CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/surv-manual/php/table-of-contents/chapter-7-measles.html)\n- [Rubeola / Measles \\| CDC Yellow Book 2024](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/rubeola-measles)\n\n_The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects people’s health and safety by preventing_\n_and controlling diseases and injuries; enhances health decisions by providing credible information on_\n_critical health issues; and promotes healthy living through strong partnerships with local, national_\n_and international organizations._\n\n**[U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES](http://www.hhs.gov/)**\n\n**HAN message types**\n\n- **Health Alert:** Conveys the highest level of importance about a public health incident.\n- **Health Advisory:** Provides important information about a public health incident.\n- **Health Update:** Provides updated information about a public health incident.\n\n###\n\n\nThis message was distributed to state and local health officers, state and local epidemiologists, state and local laboratory directors, public information officers, HAN coordinators, and clinician organizations.\n\n###\n\n\n[HAN-00521: Ebola Outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00521.html)\n\nMarch 7, 2025\n\n[Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00522.html#content-sources) [Print](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00522.html#print) [Share](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00522.html#share)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Fphp%2Fnotices%2Fhan00522.html \"Share to Facebook\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Fphp%2Fnotices%2Fhan00522.html&title=Expanding%20Measles%20Outbreak%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Guidance%20for%20the%20Upcoming%20Travel%20Season \"Share to LinkedIn\") [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Fphp%2Fnotices%2Fhan00522.html&text=Expanding%20Measles%20Outbreak%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Guidance%20for%20the%20Upcoming%20Travel%20Season \"Share to Twitter\") [Syndicate](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/sharecontent/https://https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00522.html \"Embed this Page\")\n\nContent Source:\n\n[Office of Emergency Risk Communication (OERC)](https://www.cdc.gov/orr/index.html)\n\n## Related Pages\n\n- [Health Alert Network (HAN) Archive](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/index.html)\n- [HAN-00524: Ebola Outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00524.html)\n- [HAN-00523: Dengue Virus Infections](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00523.html)\n- [HAN-00521: Ebola Outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00521.html)\n- [HAN-00520: Subtyping of Influenza A](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00520.html)\n\n[View AllHAN](https://www.cdc.gov/han/site.html#php)\n\nBack to Top\n\n## [HAN](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html)\n\nHAN provides urgent notifications about public health incidents and emerging health threats.\n\n[View All](https://www.cdc.gov/han/site.html)\n\n- [Health Alert Network (HAN)](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html)\n- [Health Alert Network (HAN) Archive](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/index.html)\n- [A-Z Index](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/jurisdictions/index.html)\n\n[Sign up for Email Updates](https://tools.cdc.gov/campaignproxyservice/subscriptions.aspx?topic_id=USCDC_486)\n\n[Go to top](https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00522.html# \"Go to top\")",

More than 150 people have been hospitalized due to the growing outbreak and three have died, including two unvaccinated children in Texas. Amna Nawaz discussed more with Dr. Adam Ratner, author of \"Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children's Health.\"\n\n## Read the Full Transcript\n\n_Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors._\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\n2025 is now the worst year for measles cases in this country in more than three decades. That's according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 150 people have been hospitalized due to the growing outbreak, and three have died, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.\n\nTo help us break down the new data, we're joined now by Dr. Adam Ratner. He's a member of the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the author of \"Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children's Health.\"\n\nDr. Ratner, thanks for joining us.\n\nWhen we say it's the worst year in all those years, here's a quick look at the numbers. The national case count reached 1,288 on Wednesday. That is across 38 states. There have been 162 hospitalizations. About half of those are children under the age of 5.\n\nDoctor, put that into context for us. How do these numbers compare to years past?\n\nDr. Adam Ratner, American Academy of Pediatrics: Right. So this is the largest number of cases in more than 30 years. It goes back to before we had eliminated measles from the United States, which happened in the year 2000.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, we had large outbreaks in a number of cities. And that's when we had these really high case counts. And we're rivaling those numbers now. So this is a really disappointing milestone we have hit.\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nAnd the year is only half over at this point. Do you expect this trend to continue?\n\n**Dr. Adam Ratner:**\n\nI mean, I think that the case numbers this year have really been driven by the outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico. That appears to be slowing down.\n\nBut I think it's alarming that we have measles in many states now. And I'm concerned that there will be other unvaccinated communities where measles gets in and starts to spread.\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nYou mentioned the number of active outbreaks in states, but the largest outbreak, as you pointed out, starting a few months ago in an undervaccinated community in West Texas. You described outbreaks like that as the canary in the coal mine. Why?\n\n**Dr. Adam Ratner:**\n\nBecause measles is our most contagious disease. It is more contagious than flu or COVID or polio or Ebola or anything else that you can think of.\n\nAnd so, when we start to see vaccination rates drop, when we start to see local public health departments struggle to maintain funding and personnel, the first thing that we see are measles outbreaks. Measles outbreaks are important, in and of themselves, as we have seen in West Texas this year. We have had a couple of children die there.\n\nThey can be very serious. But it's also a warning sign that other things are coming. And we're already starting to see some of these other vaccine-preventable diseases like whooping cough coming back this year as well.\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nWhat role do medical and religious exemptions play in all of this? And how do you look at that balance between public health and personal freedom?\n\n**Dr. Adam Ratner:**\n\nRight.\n\nSo vaccine mandates, meaning school-based vaccine requirements, were an integral part of getting to measles elimination. And I think that, without those sorts of mandates, we don't get to the levels of vaccination that we need to control a disease as contagious as measles.\n\nThere will always be, there have to be medical exemptions to vaccine mandates for the very rare children that have an allergy to something that's in one of the vaccines. Clearly, you don't require that child to get that vaccine.\n\nBut it's the non-medical exemptions that have grown over the last decade or so and that really put some of these communities at much higher risk.\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nThis is all, of course, happening in the context of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last month firing all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. He replaced them with his own choices.\n\nKennedy, of course, as we know has expressed anti-vaccine views in the past. But he argues, Dr. Ratner, that this will help to restore public trust in vaccines. How do you look at these changes?\n\n**Dr. Adam Ratner:**\n\nI think that these changes are alarming and that this is the least qualified and least transparent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that we have ever seen.\n\nIt's — the meeting that happened last month of that committee was alarming, because they talked about revisiting the entire vaccine schedule. There were presentations from anti-vaccine groups. And I think that we're in a very dangerous place with measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases spreading and with the HHS secretary and now the ACIP seemingly working against vaccination.\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nDr. Adam Ratner, a member of the Committee on Infectious Diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.\n\n**Dr. Adam Ratner:**\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you.\n\n## Listen to this Segment\n\n[Play](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/measles-cases-surge-to-highest-levels-in-over-30-years-cdc-data-shows#)\n\n00:00\n\n…\n\n[Volume](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/measles-cases-surge-to-highest-levels-in-over-30-years-cdc-data-shows#)\n\n[Watch\\\\\n\\\\\n![FILE PHOTO: Aftermath of deadly flooding in Hunt, Texas](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/july-10-2025-pbs-news-hour-full-episode)\n\nWatch the Full Episode\n\n[PBS NewsHour from Jul 10, 2025](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/july-10-2025-pbs-news-hour-full-episode)\n\n[![Amna Nawaz](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2018/06/mmorgan_240724_104609-crop3-web-150x150.jpg)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/amna-nawaz)\n\nBy —\n\n[Amna Nawaz](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/amna-nawaz) [Amna Nawaz](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/amna-nawaz)\n\nAmna Nawaz serves as co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS News Hour.\n\n* * *\n\n[@IAmAmnaNawaz](https://twitter.com/IAmAmnaNawaz)\n\nBy —\n\n[Jackson Hudgins](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/jackson-hudgins) [Jackson Hudgins](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/jackson-hudgins)\n\nBy —\n\n[Jenna Bloom](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/jenna-bloom) [Jenna Bloom](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/jenna-bloom)\n\n## [The Latest](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/latest)\n\n[![](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/civil-rights-leader-jesse-jackson-hospitalized-for-rare-neurological-disorder)\n\n[Nation](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation) Nov 13\n\n[Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson hospitalized for rare neurological disorder](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/civil-rights-leader-jesse-jackson-hospitalized-for-rare-neurological-disorder)\n\nBy Sophia Tareen, Associated Press\n\n[![Yes on proposition 50 sign for redistricting in California](https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/assets/images/placeholder.jpg)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/doj-sues-to-block-california-map-that-could-tip-control-of-congress-to-dems)\n\n[Politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics) Nov 13\n\n[DOJ sues to block California map that could tip control of Congress to Dems](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/doj-sues-to-block-california-map-that-could-tip-control-of-congress-to-dems)\n\nBy Alanna Durkin, Michael R.

Someone who is infected can spread the disease to other people before noticing any symptoms.\n- CDC data show that unvaccinated people have a very high likelihood, about 90% risk, that they will contract measles if exposed. Unvaccinated children who have not previously been infected are more likely to get infected and should avoid exposure.\n  - One in five children who contract measles will be hospitalized.\n  - One in 20 children who contract measles will develop pneumonia.\n  - One to three children who contract measles in 1,000 will die.\n- CDC data show the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective. Individuals with a history of prior infection or vaccination who have received the full series of MMR vaccines are 97% protected within two to three weeks of vaccination and are unlikely to contract measles.\n- Measles infection can cause “immune amnesia” or immune suppression, effectively erasing the immune system’s memory and protection from other diseases. This immune weakening can last anywhere from weeks to years. This increases the risk of other infections, even if you have built immunity from a previous infection.\n\n* * *\n\n## Supporting Messages\n\nThe following information can be used in communications responses related to measles transmission, exposure, vaccine guidance, and vaccine safety information. **This is not an exhaustive list to address the outbreak situation, and health departments and other organizations should consult federal and state authorities in developing responsive communications for their priority audiences.**\n\n### Background on Measles\n\n- **Measles is one of the most highly contagious airborne diseases and is among the leading global causes of death in children, despite the existence of a highly effective and safe vaccine.**\n  - Medical and public health experts, including the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend that children and adolescents aged 12 months and older get an MMR vaccine to help protect them from serious illness.\n  - Children under five years of age, adults over 20 years of age, pregnant people, and people with immunocompromised health are most at risk of measles complications.\n- Measles infection causes a rash to appear, along with high fevers, diarrhea, coughing, runny nose, eye and ear infections. Someone who is infected can spread the disease to other people before noticing any symptoms, especially in the four days before and after the rash develops.\n  - In severe cases, measles causes children’s brains to swell, leading to seizures, deafness, cognitive disability, and possibly death. About 1 in every 20 children with measles also contracts pneumonia, the top cause of pediatric death from measles and a serious respiratory illness.\n  - Measles even causes immune system weakening that can last weeks to years. A suppressed immune system increases the risk of infection due to secondary bacterial and other infections.\n\n- **Measles outbreaks are on the rise again in the United States after reaching national eradication in 2000. Measles outbreaks are most common in communities where larger groups of people are unvaccinated.** This is a major public health concern given that about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. with measles require hospitalization.\n- [Since 1968](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), the measles vaccine has been the single most effective and safe approach to ensure people do not experience hospitalization, long-lasting health impacts, or death due to this viral disease.\n\n### Exposure Guidance\n\n- **The most helpful actions someone can take to prevent the spread of measles include isolating if they have a rash or believe they have been exposed, wearing a mask if around others, and contacting a healthcare provider immediately.** Isolation is a key health precaution used to prevent people with confirmed or suspected measles from spreading the virus through respiratory droplets or cross-contaminated surfaces.\n\n- **If you become sick and have not been vaccinated against measles:**\n  - Contact a healthcare provider immediately and alert them that you believe you were exposed to measles.\n    - Ask them about receiving an MMR vaccine and discuss treatment options.\n  - You should isolate for 21 days after your exposure.\n  - You should wear a mask and disinfect surfaces when near others to avoid the spread of germs in the air and on common household items.\n\n- **If you become sick and have been vaccinated against measles:**\n  - Contact a healthcare provider immediately and alert them that you believe you were exposed to measles.\n    - Discuss your vaccine history with them as part of determining possible treatment options.\n  - You should quarantine to limit contact with others. You may be advised to stay home for four days if you develop the measles rash.\n    - You should wear a mask and disinfect surfaces when near others to avoid the spread of germs in the air and on common household items.\n\n### Vaccine Guidance\n\n- **People of all ages can protect themselves and their loved ones from measles and vaccine-preventable diseases like mumps, rubella, and/or varicella (chickenpox) by getting the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines.**\n  - Both of these are two-dose vaccines traditionally given during early childhood when the immune system is weakest against disease. It only takes a few days for antibodies to develop in response to the MMR and MMRV vaccines. Those who have received the full series of MMR or MMRV vaccines are 97% protected within two to three weeks of vaccination and are unlikely to contract measles.\n  - Two vaccines can prevent measles in children 12 months to 12 years old: measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV). The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, and the MMRV vaccine additionally protects against varicella, also known as chickenpox. Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines require two doses.\n  - The [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/?_gl=1*1yntmyy*_ga*Mzc2MDIzNzkzLjE3NDY1NjM0NjI.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NjIyOTk1NTEkbzQwJGcwJHQxNzYyMjk5NTUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..*_gcl_au*NTk5NzcxNDMuMTc1OTg1NTI5NC4xNDM3Mzc2MTAyLjE3NTk5NTMwNzUuMTc1OTk1MzA3NQ..*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NjIyOTk1NTEkbzI1JGcwJHQxNzYyMjk5NTUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..?autologincheck=redirected) schedule recommends all children are vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. There are several options to protect children against all these diseases:\n\n    - One dose of the varicella vaccine and one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine between ages 12 and 15 months, and one dose of the varicella vaccine and one dose of the MMR vaccine between ages 4 and 6 years\n    - One dose of the varicella vaccine and one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine between ages 12 and 15 months, followed by one dose of the MMRV vaccine between ages 4 and 6 years\n    - One dose of the MMRV vaccine between ages 12 and 15 months, followed by one dose of the MMRV vaccine between ages 4 and 6 years\n  - The key difference between MMR and MMRV is that MMRV reduces the number of injections a child receives. Instead of four separate injections, a child may receive two or three separate injections if a caregiver opts for MMRV. This decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.\n- **Children over 12 months are eligible to get two doses of the MMR vaccine or MMRV, which protects against all known strains of measles.** Children who are unvaccinated, who have not completed both doses of the MMR or MMRV vaccine, or are unsure of their vaccination status should receive an MMR vaccine immediately. Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles can still receive the MMR vaccine up to 72 hours after exposure to help prevent or reduce the severity of an infection\n\n  - Due to their long-lasting nature, the MMR and MMRV vaccine doses are typically provided years apart; however, children in high-risk settings can get their second dose as soon as 28 days after the first dose.\n  - Children who are traveling with family to overseas areas where measles is less controlled may require slightly different vaccine timing to provide the best protection while abroad. In most cases, children should complete the doses at least two weeks before traveling.\n- **Teens and adults** should ensure they have completed the two-dose protocol to be best protected in the case of an outbreak.\n- **People who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or believe they could be pregnant** should contact their healthcare professional immediately to test for measles and discuss vaccine options.\n\n  - Pregnant people may be advised to wait to get the MMR vaccine until they are no longer pregnant.\n\nFor additional and more personalized information about vaccine options, encourage your audiences to contact their healthcare professional.\n\n### Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness\n\n- [Since the early 1950s,](https://historyofvaccines.org/history/measles/timeline) researchers and medical experts have worked to ensure that the [measles vaccines are safe](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html) for people ages 12 months and older. Today, MMR vaccines are routine for every child, and most who receive the vaccine do not have any serious complications afterward. Decades of clinical trial data and monitoring tens of millions of vaccinated people have continued to prove the vaccine is safe and effective.\n- [As early as the 1960s](https://historyofvaccines.org/history/measles/timeline), research has shown that measles vaccines are highly effective in preventing disease and the complications caused by the disease after exposure. **According to CDC data, receiving two doses of the [MMR vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Top%20of%20Page-,How%20Well%20Does%20the%20MMR%20Vaccine%20Work%3F,-MMR%20vaccine%20is) provides the highest level of protection, at 97% effectiveness. Even if only one dose is received, protection is still extremely high, at 93% effectiveness.** In rare cases, fully vaccinated people may contract measles, but their [symptoms tend to be milder compared to those who are unvaccinated and contract measles](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/expert-answers/getting-measles-after-vaccination/faq-20125397).\n\n  - Additionally, measles outbreaks typically occur in communities with high numbers of people who are unvaccinated. Vaccination can help reduce the spread of measles in communities and prevent infection in the small number of vaccinated people who do not have full immunity.\n\n## Communications Considerations\n\nHere are some questions to consider when communicating about the measles outbreak and measles (MMR) vaccines.\n\n### Who is your audience?\n\nThe more specific you can get about your audience, the more effective you can be in providing useful, relevant information.\n\n**Consider:**\n\n- Do I know what type of insurance my audience has? Am I specifically targeting people with public, private, or no insurance?\n- Am I communicating with individuals or organizations? If an organization, what kind of organization—school, employer, business, health care facility, etc.?\n\n### What do you want your audience to do with this information?\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- I want my community to follow specific guidance.\n- I want constituents to reach out to their insurer if they have questions about specific vaccine coverage.\n- I want community members to share this message with friends or family.\n- I want trusted messengers to help amplify this information.\n\n### What is your local context?\n\n**Consider:**\n\n- Local or state policies regarding active outbreaks that will directly impact your community.\n- Your county’s measles case rate.\n\nRead our [Plain Language for Public Health Guide](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/plain-language-for-public-health/) for more tips for effective, relevant, and accessible communications.\n\n### Related Communication Tools\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Measles-Vax.png)\n\n### [Communicating About Measles Vaccination (MMR and MMRV)](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/communicating-about-measles-vaccination-mmr-and-mmrv/)\n\nSeptember 25, 2025\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Communicating-about-Vaccine-Mandates.png)\n\n### [Communicating About Vaccine Requirements](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/communicating-about-vaccine-requirements/)\n\nSeptember 18, 2025\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chickenpox-and-Shingles.png)\n\n### [Communicating About Chickenpox and Shingles](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/communicating-about-chickenpox-and-shingles/)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n## Better communication for better health. ![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/themes/phcc/src/images/icons/heart-quote.svg)\n\nThe Public Health Communications Collaborative (PHCC) was developed in response to the urgent need for timely, relevant, and practical tools, messaging, and training to support and enhance the communications capacity of public health professionals across the country.\n\n[About](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/about/)\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/themes/phcc/src/images/phcc-about2x.webp)\n\nNotifications",
