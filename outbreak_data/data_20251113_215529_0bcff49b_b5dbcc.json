This number is the total number of people hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. It is not the current number of people in the hospital.\n\nThere have been two fatalities in school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. The children were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.\n\nBased on the most recent data, DSHS has identified a designated outbreak county with ongoing measles transmission: Lamar.\n\nDSHS is working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.\n\nWorkbook: 2025 Measles Outbreak Website (3)\n\nUnexpected Error\n\nAn unexpected error occurred.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.\n\nPeople who live in or visit the counties in the outbreak counties listed above should follow the [outbreak vaccination recommendations](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-infographic.pdf).\n\nTo get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the [measles outbreak page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles) to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.\n\nAdditional information for the public and health care providers is available at the links below:\n\n[Measles Outbreak page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles)\n\n[Measles FAQ page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Jan. 30 Announcing Cases in Gaines County](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/state-health-officials-urge-vigilance-additional-measles-cases-are-identified)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Feb. 25 Outbreak Update](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/dshs-provides-update-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Feb. 26 Texas Announces First Death in Measles Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS News Release – April 6 Texas Announces Second Death in Measles Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – Feb. 5 Gaines County Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – Feb. 24 Measles Exposures in South & Central Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-exposures-central-south-central-texas)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – March 6 Measles Outbreak Case Definition](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-case-definition)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – April 7 Texas 2025 Measles Outbreak – Expanded Outbreak Counties](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-texas-2025-measles-outbreak-expanded-outbreak-counties)\n\n## Data\n\n[School Coverage](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage)\n\n[Conscientious Exemptions](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions)\n\n[Measles (Rubeola) Data \\| Texas DSHS](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola/measles-rubeola/measles-rubeola-data)\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other 2025 Texas Measles Cases**\n\n| County | Cases |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bell | 1 |\n| Bexar | 1 |\n| Brazoria | 1 |\n| Collin | 3 |\n| Dallas | 1 |\n| Denton | 2 |\n| El Paso | 2 |\n| Fort Bend | 1 |\n| Harris | 5 |\n| Harrison | 1 |\n| Hays | 1 |\n| Midland | 1 |\n| Randall | 2 |\n| Rockwall | 1 |\n| Scurry | 1 |\n| Shackelford | 1 |\n| Tarrant | 4 |\n| Travis | 2 |\n| Williamson | 8 |\n| **Total** | **39** |\n\n2025 Texas Measles Cases Not Associated with the Outbreak in West Texas\n\nCases on this table may be moved to the West Texas outbreak dashboard if further investigation indicates a connection to the outbreak.\n\nSubscribe to our email list\n\nSign up to receive DSHS email and text updates\n\n[Sign up for Updates](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXHHSC/subscriber/new?topic_id=TXHHSC_85 \"\")",

The cases show a significant increase in 2025.](http://composer.publications.aap.org/media/r1kh44ol/measles_091625.jpg?rmode=max&width=1265&height=477)\n\n## Clinical Guidance\n\n- **Presentation:** Consider measles in patients with fever and rash and ask about recent international travel, exposure to international travelers, or exposure to people with measles. Patients may have non-specific symptoms (fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis) without rash in the prodromal phase of infection, so heightened suspicion, particularly during local outbreaks or in patients with recent travel, can be key to timely diagnosis. The incubation period between exposure and initial symptoms is approximately 8-12 days. **For images of rash see the _Red Book_** **chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Measles virus infection can be confirmed by: (1) detection of measles viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); (2) detection of measles virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M; (3) a fourfold increase in measles IgG antibody concentration in paired acute and convalescent serum specimens (collected at least 10 days apart); or (4) isolation of measles virus in cell culture.\n- **Who is at highest risk of acquiring measles infection:**\n\n  - Unvaccinated children or adults\n  - Incompletely vaccinated (<2 doses of MMR) children or adults\n  - Individuals with known exposure to measles or recent travel to areas with active measles transmission.\n\n- **Who is at highest risk of severe measles infection or complications of measles:**\n\n  - Infants and children aged less than 5 years\n  - Adults aged more than 20 years\n  - Pregnant women\n  - People with compromised immune systems, such as from cancer, chemotherapy, or HIV infection\n\n- **Complications:** Measles can cause serious illness, even in previously healthy children. Complications of measles can include:\n\n  - Ear infections\n  - Diarrhea\n  - Pneumonia (either from measles virus itself or from bacterial superinfection)\n  - Encephalitis\n  - Death\n  - In addition, measles infection increases the risk of other severe infections for months or years after measles through the mechanism of immune amnesia.\n\n- **Precautions for patients with suspected or confirmed measles infection**: Airborne precautions are needed whenever there is any suspicion of measles exposure. Promptly isolate, collect specimens, and report patients with suspected measles to public health.\n- **Prevention of measles**: Vaccination is the cornerstone of measles prevention. All children should receive measles vaccination as part of the routine childhood vaccine schedule. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized children should begin catch-up vaccination as soon as possible. During an outbreak, MMR vaccine should be offered to all people with known exposure or in the outbreak community who lack evidence of measles immunity. During a community-wide outbreak that affects infants, MMR vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing symptoms after exposure and may be recommended for infants 6 through 11 months of age. Children who receive their first MMR vaccine prior to 12 months of age will require two additional doses after 12 months of age for full protection. IGIM administered exposed, measles-susceptible people (not previously vaccinated or immunocompromised) will prevent or attenuate infection if administered within 6 days of exposure.\n- **Treatment:** There is no specific antiviral agent for treatment of measles infection. Treatment of children with measles with oral vitamin A decreases measles-related morbidity and mortality. Dosing of vitamin A for treatment of children with measles can be found in the **_Red Book_ chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\n- **Reporting:** Involvement of state and local health departments is often advisable for any suspected diagnosis of measles, as there may be specific ways these departments wish to receive specimens and manage patients.\n- **For more information see the _Red Book_** **chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\n\n## Resources\n\n- _Red Book_ chapters: [International Travel](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S1_006_010) \\| [Immune Globulin Intramuscular (IGIM)](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S1_005_002)\n- _Red Book Online_ [webinars](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15686):\n  - [Identifying and Diagnosing Measles in the Pediatric Setting](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/29920)\n  - [The Use of Vitamin A in the Management of Measles](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/31246)\n  - [Infection Prevention & Control for Measles](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/31754)\n  - [Spotting a Threat: Measles in Immunocompromised Children](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15686)\n- CDC: [Measles (Rubeola)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html)\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| **Pediatric Practice Tools and Info**<br>Watch this CDC video to learn more about the signs and symptoms of measles to quickly diagnose infected patients.

A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to [the deaths](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-death-texas-outbreak/) of [two children](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-second-child-death-unvaccinated/).\n\nThe number of cases in Texas alone grew to over [760](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025) before the state declared it [officially over](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-over-health-officials/) in August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,500, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.\n\n[Measles](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-measles-mmr-vaccine-symptoms/) is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause [severe infections](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html#) in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say [the vaccine](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-preventable-symptoms/), which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is [highly safe and effective](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-what-to-know/).\n\nWhile most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.\n\nThe largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well. In South Carolina, for example, [dozens of students were quarantined](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unvaccinated-students-quarantining-measles-south-carolina/) in October due to an outbreak.\n\nThe CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC.

All other countries continue to maintain their measles elimination status.\n\n“This loss represents a setback—but it is also reversible,” said Dr. Barbosa, “Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our Region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the Region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement.”\n\n## Current situation\n\nAs of 7 November 2025, 12,596 confirmed measles cases have been reported across ten countries (approximately 95% of the Region’s cases in Canada, Mexico and US), a 30-fold increase compared to 2024. Twenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, 3 in the United States, and 2 in Canada.\n\nActive outbreaks are ongoing in Canada, Mexico, the United States, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize, mostly triggered by imported cases. Transmission has primarily affected under-vaccinated communities, with 89% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. Children under 1 year of age are the most affected, followed by those aged one to four years.\n\nCanada’s measles outbreak began in October 2024 in the province of New Brunswick and has since spread nationwide, with more than 5,000 confirmed cases reported nationwide. Although declining, transmission persists in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.\n\nMeasles is highly contagious. A single infected person can transmit it to up to 18 others. Severe complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and death. Outbreaks also disrupt daily life and place additional pressure on health systems.\n\nVaccination remains the most effective means of protection. Over the past 25 years, the measles vaccine has prevented more than six million deaths across the Americas —and an estimated 15 million deaths over the last 50 years. Nevertheless, in 2024, regional coverage for the second dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR2) averaged 79%—well below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In addition, only 31% of countries reached 95% or more coverage for the first dose, and just 20% achieved that level for the second dose.\n\n## PAHO’s response and recommendations\n\nPAHO continues to provide technical support to countries to strengthen surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, outbreak response, and vaccination campaigns. Experts have been deployed to Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia, and the organization is monitoring risks in Belize, Brazil and Paraguay.\n\nDr. Barbosa emphasized: “Every case we prevent, every outbreak we stop saves lives, protects families, and makes communities healthier. Today, rather than lamenting the loss of a regional status, we call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases—reaching every corner of the Americas. As a Region, we have eliminated measles twice. We can do it a third time.”\n\n**RVC strongly encourages countries to:**\n\n- Continue strengthening surveillance, immunization and outbreak rapid response activities for every suspect case.\n- Expand and consolidate electronic immunization registries across all countries, following PAHO’s established guidelines.\n- Maintain sustainable laboratory surveillance by allocating sufficient financial and human resources.\n- For suspected cases with clinical and epidemiological risk factors and a negative measles IgM result (with specimens collected within 0–3 days after rash onset), perform PCR testing to confirm or rule out infection.\n- Implement all recommendations down to the local level.\n- Document outbreak closure following the [Regional Framework](https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/56855) guidelines.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe Americas have previously faced setbacks, including temporary loss of measles elimination status in Venezuela (2018) and Brazil (2019). The region regained elimination status in 2024 through coordinated regional action.\n\nTo regain measles elimination status, a country must demonstrate interruption of endemic transmission for at least 12 consecutive months, supported by comprehensive vaccination, surveillance, and outbreak-response data.\n\nCanada will now present and implement an action plan under PAHO’s regional framework, focused on boosting immunization coverage, reinforcing surveillance systems, and ensuring rapid outbreak response to stop endemic transmission and regaining measles elimination status.\n\n“Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus—because when we work together, we protect the health and lives of all people in the Americas,” Dr. Barbosa concluded.\n\n[News Releases](https://www.paho.org/en/news/news-releases)\n\n[Measles](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles)\n\n[Brasil](https://www.paho.org/pt/brasil)\n\n[Comprehensive Immunization (CIM)](https://www.paho.org/en/comprehensive-immunization-cim)\n\n## Latest news\n\n[![Measles patient](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/measles-patient.jpg?h=ae97dba1&itok=bnGMZyUl)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n[PAHO calls for regional action as the Americas lose measles elimination status](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n10 Nov 2025\n\n[![Arrival of aid to Jamaica](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/emt-aecid-llegada.jpg?h=eed8f32f&itok=Hh60dlMe)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n[PAHO scales up its emergency health response across the Caribbean following Hurricane Melissa](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[![Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO, Florika Fink-Hooijer, Director-General of HERA, and European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, who oversees HERA within the European Commission.](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/acuerdo-comision-europea.jpg?h=717d0fcf&itok=qG_9hwe-)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n[PAHO and European Commission’s Health Emergency Authority make deal to boost preparedness for cross-border health threats](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[See all the news](https://www.paho.org/en/news)",

Canada lost its official measles elimination status this week; the United States could be next.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the U.S. passed a sobering milestone: the number of measles cases across the country reached its [**highest point in three decades**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000), with 1,281 cases reported — the most since the highly contagious disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. And the year was only half over. As of Nov. 4, that total had risen to [**1,681 confirmed cases**](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nTo find out where this is heading, look to Canada, which eliminated measles back in 1998. A deadly measles outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024 is still raging, with more than 5,100 cases reported since its start. On Nov. 10, 2025, the Pan American Health Organization, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional office for the Americas, [**revoked Canada's official measles-free status**](https://theconversation.com/canada-loses-its-official-measles-free-status-and-the-us-will-follow-soon-as-vaccination-rates-fall-269090).\n\nWill the U.S. be next?\n\n![U.S. map showing measles cases in 2025. source: Johns Hopkins University](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/cumulative-measles-cases-reported-in-the-united-states-in-2025-%20%282%29.png.webp?itok=KQYAWuct)\n\n## Childhood vaccination rates have been falling worldwide\n\nMeasles elimination is defined as the interruption of endemic measles virus transmission in a specific geographic area for more than 12 months. It's an epidemiological victory — but elimination can only last as long as vaccination rates remain sufficiently high.\n\nA safe and effective measles vaccine has been in use since the 1960s. But vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, and funding cuts are disrupting efforts to reach children with essential immunizations. [**Global childhood immunization rates stalled in 2023**](https://www.unicefusa.org/press/global-childhood-immunization-levels-stalled-2023-leaving-many-without-life-saving-protection), leaving 2.7 million additional children un- or under-vaccinated, compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to WHO and UNICEF data tracking immunization trends for vaccination against 14 diseases. Measles cases surged in 2023, infecting an estimated 10.3 million people worldwide, up 22 percent from the year before. That year, 107,500 people lost their lives to measles. The overwhelming majority were children under 5.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Mexico have had sustained measles outbreaks since early 2025, putting them on track to lose their measles-free status in 2026.\n\n_**Related:**_ [_**Americans Who Never Forget: Life Without Vaccines**_](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/americans-who-never-forget-life-without-vaccines)\n\n## As measles cases surge, here are five things to know:\n\n### 1\\. Measles can be deadly.\n\n[**Measles**](https://what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization/measles) kills nearly 300 people every day, approximately 12 people every hour, mostly children under 5. Even when children survive a measles infection, the virus can leave them with long-term health effects or permanent disabilities.\n\nIn some cases, severe complications can include pneumonia, severe diarrhea, blindness and encephalitis (brain swelling). It can also weaken a child’s immune system and make them more vulnerable to other infections long after recovering from measles, a phenomenon known as immunity amnesia.\n\nAny child who is unprotected from measles through immunization is at risk, with malnourished children and those under 5 most at risk.\n\n![Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their ext…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI677988.jpg.webp?itok=UeCEte8e)Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their extended family. Their cousins were infected with the measles virus during an outbreak in the region. Despite the outbreak, the cousins' parents were hesitant about vaccinating their children. With the guidance and assistance of local health workers and leaders, they realized the importance of vaccines in keeping their children safe, and  decided to allow them to be vaccinated following their recovery from the disease. © UNICEF/U.S. CDC/UNI677988/Amanda VoisardMore\n\n### 2\\. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious airborne disease. It can spread easily as infected people breath, cough or sneeze, releasing virus particles into the air and onto surfaces that can remain infectious for up to two hours. Unfortunately, those infected with the virus can start to spread measles to others even before they know they have it — four days before the characteristic measles rash appears.\n\nOnce a child is infected with measles, 90 percent of those they come into close contact with will become infected, if they are not already immune.\n\nThe measles virus does not recognize borders. Over the past five years, measles outbreaks have hit over 100 countries, including several that had previously eliminated measles altogether.\n\n### 3\\. Vaccines are the best way to stop outbreaks and protect children.\n\nMeasles vaccines are safe. Two doses of a measles-containing vaccine provide 99 percent protection from measles for life. They are the best way to prevent children from contracting measles and spreading the disease to others. No child should risk serious health complications or death by contracting measles.\n\nSince 1974, measles vaccines have saved nearly 94 million lives. They have protected more people than any other vaccine in the [**Essential Program on Immunization**](https://www.unicef.org/blog/legacy-progress-future-promise \"A legacy of progress, a future of promise\").\n\nWhile most countries now include measles vaccines in their immunization schedules, too many children are still unprotected. The story of unvaccinated children is one of inequity, poverty and underserved communities.\n\n![A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on J…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI514454%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=7WEpTkUG)A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on Jan. 26, 2024. © UNICEF/UNI514454/Elfatih\n\n### 4\\. Low vaccination coverage is contributing to measles outbreaks.\n\nBecause measles spreads so quickly, maintaining high vaccination rates across communities is critical to preventing outbreaks. Coverage of 95 percent or greater with two doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed to protect communities from measles outbreaks. All children should be vaccinated against measles.\n\nCurrently, the global coverage rate of the first dose of the measles vaccine is 83 percent, and the second dose is just 74 percent, far below the level needed for protection. This leaves room for measles to spread and puts vulnerable groups, including unvaccinated children, at higher risk.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for ending outbreaks and reducing global measles deaths.\n\n### 5\\. A switch to five-dose vials can help governments save more lives.\n\nMeasles vaccines are often purchased in ten-dose vials. Once opened, health workers only have a few hours to administer all ten doses to children. Any unused doses will expire and must be thrown away.\n\nHealth workers can sometimes be hesitant to open a new vial for only one or two children, knowing the rest of the doses will go to waste. This hesitation and fear of wastage too often leads to unopened vials, leaving children without the shots needed to protect them from measles.\n\n**A simple** [**switch from ten-dose to five-dose vials**](https://www.unicef.org/supply/switching-ten-dose-five-dose-vials-may-equal-more-children-vaccinated-measles) **can help increase measles vaccination coverage and reduce wastage.**\n\n![On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Su…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI797774.jpg.webp?itok=D5R24uC7)On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Sudan, during a six-day catch-up campaign. “This was the first vaccination campaign since the conflict ended in Al Jazirah,” said Aseel Abbas, a health officer and supervisor of the campaign. “The campaign is important because measles can affect a child’s hearing, vision, movement and development.” © UNICEF/UNI797774/AbdulmajidMore\n\n## **UNICEF’s role in combatting measles**\n\nUNICEF’s mission is to [**reach every single child with lifesaving vaccines**](https://www.unicefusa.org/what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization).\n\nEach year, UNICEF delivers around 250 million doses of measles-containing vaccines. These vaccines are essential for protecting childrenagainst measles through routine immunization programs and preventative campaigns in over 90 countries **.** The vaccines are also critical for responding to measles outbreaks, including in conflict and humanitarian settings.\n\nAs the world's largest vaccine buyer, UNICEF leverages its significant purchasing power to secure a reliable and sustainable supply of quality-assured measles-containing vaccines at affordable prices. The measles-containing vaccines are safe and cost-effective in saving children's lives.\n\nUNICEF is part of the [**Measles and Rubella Partnership**](https://measlesrubellapartnership.org/), a private-public partnership including WHO, CDC, United Nations Foundation and American Red Cross that spearheads a global push towards measles and rubella elimination and control.\n\nBy continuing to invest in and prioritize vaccines, we can ensure that no child anywhere dies of an illness we know how to prevent.\n\n_**Your contribution to UNICEF is more important than ever.**_\n\nDonate Button\n\nDONATE\n\n_**Right now, the lives of the most vulnerable children hang in the balance as conflicts and crises jeopardize the care and protection that they deserve.

But UNICEF won't stop working to keep children healthy and safe.\n\nUNICEF works in over 190 countries and territories — more places than any other children's organization. UNICEF has the world's largest humanitarian warehouse and, when disaster strikes, can get supplies almost anywhere within 72 hours.

DSHS will continue to monitor for new cases but will cease updating the interactive outbreak dashboard.\n\nPublic health professionals consider a measles outbreak over after 42 days with no new cases because that is double the disease’s maximum incubation period, the longest time it can take between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they get sick.\n\n## **Measles information**\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection, which can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not vaccinated. Measles can be prevented with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\n[Find measles resources at the bottom of the page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola#resources)\n\n## Symptoms\n\n### Early symptoms (first few days):\n\n- Moderate fever\n- Cough\n- Runny nose\n- Red eyes\n- Sore throat\n\n### Later symptoms (after a few days):\n\n- Blue-white spots inside the mouth (Koplik spots)\n- Red-brown rash that starts at the hairline and spreads down the body\n- High fever (can go over 104°F)\n\nThe rash usually appears 14 days after exposure. Some immunocompromised people may not develop the rash.\n\n### When to seek emergency care\n\nMeasles typically starts with cough, runny nose, and red eyes and often leads to a rash and fever over 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If you think you have measles, get medical care. Symptoms can become worse over time, complications can develop, and measles can be deadly if you don’t receive appropriate care. If you have any of these symptoms, go to the emergency room immediately:\n\n- A hard time breathing or breathing faster than normal\n- Signs of severe dehydration (dry nose and mouth, urinating less than usual)\n- Confusion, decreased alertness, or severe weakness\n- For young children: a blue color around the mouth, crying without making tears, unusually low energy, or severe loss of appetite\n\nHave someone call the ER to let them know a person with measles is coming in so they can see you away from other patients.\n\n### How long is a person contagious?\n\nPeople are contagious about four days before their rash starts to four days after it appears. If you might have measles, stay home during this time.\n\n## Spread\n\nHow Measles Spreads:\n\n- **Through the air** when an infected person **coughs, sneezes or talks** (the virus can live on surfaces or in the air for up to **two hours**).\n- **By touching contaminated surfaces** and then touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious virus; 90% of the people close to an infected person who are not immune will become infected with the measles virus.\n\n## Prevention\n\n- The **best way** to prevent measles is to **be vaccinated** with **two doses** of a measles-containing vaccine. This is primarily administered as the **MMR vaccine**.\n- The **MMR vaccine** protects against **measles, mumps, and rubella**.\n- **Two doses** prevent more than **97% of measles infections**.\n\nContact your doctor to schedule a vaccine.\n\nPharmacists can vaccinate children aged 13 and under with a prescription from their doctor. They can vaccinate children 14 and up without a prescription.\n\nIf you live in west Texas, visit [WTXvaccine.org](https://wtxvaccine.org/) to find a vaccine clinic near you.\n\nDSHS offers several low-cost programs for vaccination.

There are now 1,723 confirmed measles cases this year, reported by 43 jurisdictions.\n\nEighty-seven percent of measles cases are outbreak-associated, and there have been 45 US outbreaks in 2025. Among measles patients, 92% have been unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccine status. Only 4% have received both doses of measles-containing vaccine.\n\nLast year the United States had 285 measles cases. US measles activity is the highest it has been since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.\n\n### **Lost elimination status for Americas**\n\nEarlier this week, [Canada lost](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-after-record-year-outbreaks) its elimination status after it failed to contain a nationwide outbreak for 12 months that has topped 5,000 infections. This dubious milestone also meant a loss of elimination status for the entire Americas region.\n\nThe United States will be on track to follow Canada in January 2026, which will mark 12 months since a large West Texas measles outbreak began.\n\nCurrent [hot spots](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-count-climbs-arizona-utah-south-carolina-outbreaks) include the Utah-Arizona border and Upstate South Carolina.\n\n# Study supports wider use of watchful waiting for kids' ear infections\n\nNews brief\n\nToday at 2:39 p.m.\n\n[Chris Dall, MA](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chris-dall-ma)\n\nTopics\n\n[Antimicrobial Stewardship](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship)\n\n![Child having ear examined](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/ear%20exam%20tot.jpg)Ivan-balvan / iStock\n\nA new [study](https://academic.oup.com/jpids/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jpids/piaf104/8321658 \"(opens in a new window)\") of children with ear infections suggests that wider uptake of \"watchful waiting\" could help reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, US researchers reported yesterday in the _Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society._\n\nLed by researchers with the University of Utah and Intermountain Health, the multicenter, retrospective observational study analyzed data on children ages six months to 17 years who received a diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM) in ambulatory practice settings at health systems in Illinois, Colorado, and Utah from July 2018 through December 2023.\n\nThe aim was to determine visits in which children received an immediate antibiotic prescription (within 2 days of the index visit) and those that used watchful waiting, a strategy that can involve monitoring symptoms and prescribing an antibiotic only if it's needed, or a delayed antibiotic prescription. The researchers also evaluated the outcomes associated with the two approaches.\n\nThe study authors note that roughly 100 million antibiotic courses are prescribed for children with AOM annually, though over 80% of cases resolve on their own.\n\n\"Randomized clinical trials have shown that watchful waiting can reduce antibiotic use for AOM by approximately 60% with similar patient outcomes and parent satisfaction to immediate antibiotic use,\" the authors wrote. \"Despite these favorable data, evidence suggests watchful waiting is utilized in only 5-20% of cases.\"\n\n### Favorable clinical outcomes\n\nOf the 140,579 visits for AOM, an immediate antibiotic was prescribed in 84.4%, and watchful waiting was used in 15.6%. Of the watchful-waiting patients, 56% were not prescribed an antibiotic, and 44% received a delayed prescription. Rates of treatment failure and recurrence were low in both groups, with only 6% of the watchful-waiting group and 7% of the immediate antibiotic group receiving any antibiotic 3 to 30 days after the index visit.\n\n\"When watchful waiting was utilized, clinical outcomes were favorable as evidenced by the infrequent need for a new antibiotic prescription in the 30 days after the index visit,\" the authors wrote. \"Interventions to scale up use of watchful waiting for AOM may therefore be a high-yield approach to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure for children with AOM.\"\n\n# WHO deploys aid to Ethiopia after 8 suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported\n\nNews brief\n\nToday at 2:32 p.m.\n\n[Mary Van Beusekom, MS](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mary-van-beusekom-ms)\n\nTopics\n\n[Viral Hemorrhagic Fever](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/viral-hemorrhagic-fever)\n\n![Workers moving a box](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/Viral%20hemorrhagic%20fever.png)_Photo: Sabin Vaccine Institute_\n\nEight suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever of unidentified cause in Ethiopia have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to dispatch a team of responders and deliver medical supplies to the southern part of the country, near its border with South Sudan.\n\nIn a [news release](https://www.afro.who.int/news/ethiopia-suspected-viral-haemorrhagic-fever-outbreak \"(opens in a new window)\") today, WHO Africa said that Ethiopian health authorities are ramping up their response and conducting lab tests to identify the cause of the infection and stop further transmission.\n\n\"To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement,\" the WHO wrote.\n\nEthiopia's Health Ministry will likely announce the results of the ongoing investigation tomorrow, according to [media reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/13/ethiopia-viral-hemorrhagic-fever-outbreak-who/22aa9f7e-c0a3-11f0-8eee-a78486b4c797_story.html \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\n### Provision of personal protective equipment, financial aid\n\nThe WHO is providing essential supplies such as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, infection-prevention materials, and a rapidly deployable isolation tent to improve clinical care and boost management capacity.\n\n> WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks.\n\nThe organization has also released $300,000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support and is marshaling technical capacity to support the response.\n\nViral hemorrhagic fevers, a group of epidemic-prone diseases caused by several distinct families of viruses, include Marburg, Ebola, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever.\n\nSigns and symptoms vary by virus, but initially they often include high fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, weakness, and exhaustion.

And although _S epidermidis_ is commonly found on human skin and is generally harmless, there is concern that drug-resistant strains in milk could spread resistance genes to more harmful bacteria like methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus._\n\n\"Given the public health implications of antibiotic-resistant _S. epidermidis_ in dairy production, it is essential to monitor the prevalence and resistance profiles of this pathogen in milk,\" the study authors wrote.\n\n### Half of _S epidermidis_ isolates are multidrug-resistant\n\nThe overall prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 26%, and 40 (12.9%) of the 310 milk samples collected tested positive for _S epidermidis._\n\nAntibiotic susceptibility tests showed high resistance rates (95%) to penicillin and erythromycin; moderate rates of resistance to cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol; and low rates of resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Half of the _S epidermidis_ isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant.\n\nAmong the resistance genes identified, _ermC_ was most prevalent (87.5%), followed by _tetK_ (80%) and _mecA_ (45%).\n\nThe authors say widespread use of antibiotics to treat mastitis and other diseases of dairy cattle and sheep likely explains the high levels of resistance.\n\n\"The presence of multidrug-resistant _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ in raw milk highlights how on-farm antibiotic use directly shapes public health risks,\" they said in a journal [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1104689 \"(opens in a new window)\"). \"These findings emphasize the urgent need for responsible antibiotic use and improved hygiene practices in the dairy sector to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance transmission through the food chain.\"\n\n[ALL BRIEFS](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/search?type%5Bscan%5D=scan&sort_by=date)\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n[More avian flu detected on Indiana duck, chicken farms](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/more-avian-flu-detected-indiana-duck-chicken-farms)\n\n[13 cases of infant botulism tied to tainted baby formula](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/13-cases-infant-botulism-tied-tainted-baby-formula)\n\n[Ivermectin found to be safe, effective in small children with scabies](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/ivermectin-found-be-safe-effective-small-children-scabies)\n\n[Quick takes: Whooping cough in Texas, polio in 2 nations, Canada Salmonella outbreak](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/quick-takes-whooping-cough-texas-polio-2-nations-canada-salmonella-outbreak)\n\n[Measles count climbs in Arizona-Utah, South Carolina outbreaks](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-count-climbs-arizona-utah-south-carolina-outbreaks)\n\n[Kids with eczema may have fewer related infections, allergic complications after COVID vaccination](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kids-eczema-may-have-fewer-related-infections-allergic-complications-after-covid)\n\n[Resistance exercise boosts physical function, quality of life in COVID survivors](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/resistance-exercise-boosts-physical-function-quality-life-covid-survivors)\n\n[Quick takes: More infant botulism cases, measles in Louisiana, Ebola in DR Congo](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/quick-takes-more-infant-botulism-cases-measles-louisiana-ebola-dr-congo)\n\n[More avian flu detected on Indiana duck, chicken farms](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/more-avian-flu-detected-indiana-duck-chicken-farms)\n\n[13 cases of infant botulism tied to tainted baby formula](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/13-cases-infant-botulism-tied-tainted-baby-formula)\n\n[Ivermectin found to be safe, effective in small children with scabies](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/ivermectin-found-be-safe-effective-small-children-scabies)\n\n[Quick takes: Whooping cough in Texas, polio in 2 nations, Canada Salmonella outbreak](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/quick-takes-whooping-cough-texas-polio-2-nations-canada-salmonella-outbreak)\n\n[Measles count climbs in Arizona-Utah, South Carolina outbreaks](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-count-climbs-arizona-utah-south-carolina-outbreaks)\n\n[Kids with eczema may have fewer related infections, allergic complications after COVID vaccination](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kids-eczema-may-have-fewer-related-infections-allergic-complications-after-covid)\n\n[Resistance exercise boosts physical function, quality of life in COVID survivors](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/resistance-exercise-boosts-physical-function-quality-life-covid-survivors)\n\n[Quick takes: More infant botulism cases, measles in Louisiana, Ebola in DR Congo](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/quick-takes-more-infant-botulism-cases-measles-louisiana-ebola-dr-congo)\n\n[More avian flu detected on Indiana duck, chicken farms](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/more-avian-flu-detected-indiana-duck-chicken-farms)\n\n[13 cases of infant botulism tied to tainted baby formula](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/13-cases-infant-botulism-tied-tainted-baby-formula)\n\n[Ivermectin found to be safe, effective in small children with scabies](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/ivermectin-found-be-safe-effective-small-children-scabies)\n\n[Quick takes: Whooping cough in Texas, polio in 2 nations, Canada Salmonella outbreak](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/quick-takes-whooping-cough-texas-polio-2-nations-canada-salmonella-outbreak)\n\n## This week's top reads\n\n01.

An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same infectious disease linked to a common exposure.\n\nThere has been a rise in measles cases in the Upstate this year, with most concentrated in Spartanburg County.\n\nSome cases are travel-related exposures or close contacts of known cases. Other cases have no identified source, suggesting that measles is circulating in the community and could spread further. We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Measles is highly contagious**:\n  - A person is **contagious four days** **before** **and** **after** **a rash begins**, meaning someone can spread measles before they know they are infected.\n  - The virus can **linger in the air for up to two hours** after an infected person leaves.\n- The measles vaccine (MMR and MMRV) is the best way to protect yourself and others against measles. Use the [DPH Recommendations for Measles Vaccination chart](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/Measles_Outbreak_Vaccine_Recommendations_20251020.pdf) to understand if you need to be vaccinated or not.\n\n## Updates\n\nWe will post measles updates twice a week, at noon on Tuesday and Friday. In time, this update frequency may change to more or less each week depending on disease activity.\n\n### Mobile Health Unit (MHU) Vaccines\n\nIn response to the ongoing measles outbreak, the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) has activated its Mobile Health Unit to deploy to the following locations to offer measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to unvaccinated individuals at no cost. _NOTE: The MMR vaccine is given as a two-dose series and booster doses are generally not needed. DPH also provides information about vaccine services by other providers.

Measles\n\nMost people recover from measles completely on their own. For uncomplicated cases, bed rest, drinking plenty of fluids and over-the-counter medications to reduce the fever and headache may help make infected individuals more comfortable. For those who require hospitalization, supportive care is the only treatment.\n\nDPH’s [measles page](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola \"Measles (Rubeola)\") contains what people need to know about measles (e.g., video, educational materials), and frequently asked questions about symptoms, prevention, vaccination history, and DPH’s role in protecting South Carolina from measles.\n\n### Understanding South Carolina's Vaccination Rates Among School Children\n\nWe still have vulnerable populations, both nationally and in South Carolina. The CDC reports that in 2025: the majority, 97%, of people who got measles were unvaccinated. Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. Travelers with measles continue to bring measles into the U.S. Measles can spread easily when it reaches a community where groups of people are unvaccinated. Based on the 2021 CDC NIS (National Immunization Survey) Child data, coverage rates in the 19- to 35-month-old survey indicate that 88.9% of these aged children in South Carolina have had at least one dose of MMR vaccine.

These new measles cases can all be tied to either domestic or international travel and all of the new cases are among unvaccinated people. Health officials are urging families to make sure they are up to date on their immunizations, especially ahead of travel.\n\nSeven of the cases reported this week were within families who had recent domestic travel and were related to three other cases reported last week. Three additional but unrelated cases added this week were tied to international travel.\n\nMeasles has been on the rise around the country in 2025. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed more than 1,500 cases this year, the highest number since the U.S. reported 2,126 cases in 1992. There have also been three confirmed deaths from measles in the U.S. in 2025.\n\n“The significant increase in measles cases around the U.S. this year, and the fact that measles is still very prevalent in other countries, continues to highlight the urgency for families to make sure their children are up to date on their measles immunizations,” said Myra Kunas, assistant commissioner for MDH's Health Protection Bureau. “Measles is one of the most infectious diseases on the planet. It spreads easily, and it finds those who are not vaccinated.”\n\nThe immunization to protect against measles—the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine—is very effective. After one dose of vaccine, it is about 93% effective at preventing measles infection. After two doses, protection against infection rises to 97%. Decades of data also show that the [MMR vaccine is safe](https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/).\n\nChildren should receive the first vaccine dose at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. For all ages, it is important to talk to your doctor if you are going to be [traveling to another country](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/plan-for-travel.html) or an area of the U.S. with a measles outbreak. Children 6 to 12 months old can get an early dose of MMR vaccine if their travels will put them at high risk for measles. Your doctor can check to make sure you and your family are up to date on your immunizations and make sure you do not need any other immunizations.\n\nMDH encourages people to check their immunization records to confirm that they and their children have received the MMR vaccine. Minnesotans can also go to [Find My Immunization Record](https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/miic/records.html). Most people born before 1957 have had measles disease and are considered immune.\n\nInitial symptoms of measles include a fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes followed by a rash that typically spreads from the head to the rest of the body. It generally takes eight to 12 days from exposure for someone with measles to develop the first symptoms. The measles rash usually appears two to three days after the fever begins.\n\nIf symptoms develop, people should call their health care provider before going to a clinic. Calling first is an important way to ensure that proper care is received without accidentally exposing other people to measles.\n\n“The awareness and recognition of measles symptoms is crucial in our efforts to prevent the spread of measles,” said Jessica Hancock-Allen, director of the infectious disease division at MDH. “We are encouraging families to be aware of symptoms of measles, particularly the rash, and call their health care provider if they notice a rash--especially if their child is unvaccinated and has been exposed to someone with measles or has travelled recently. We are also reminding our health care provider partners to think about measles and ask about travel—domestic or international—and possible exposures if a patient has any symptoms of measles.”\n\nPeople who have not been vaccinated and are exposed to measles will be asked to stay home from work, school, child care, public spaces and other activities for at least 21 days. Staying home is extremely important to help stop the spread of the disease to others since a person can be contagious even before symptoms start.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious rash illness and can be a serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. Measles spreads easily by coughing, sneezing or even being in the same room with someone who has measles. The virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area.\n\nAdditional information about measles can be found on the MDH [Measles](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/index.html) website.\n\n**-MDH-**\n\n_**Media inquiries:**_\n\n**Garry Bowman**\n\n**MDH Communications**\n\n**651-529-5164**\n\n[**garry.bowman@state.mn.us**](mailto:garry.bowman@state.mn.us)\n\nTags\n\n- [news](https://www.health.state.mn.us/taxonomy/term/1216)\n\n**Last Updated:** 10/01/2025",
