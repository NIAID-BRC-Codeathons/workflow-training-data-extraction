MPX is endemic in central and western Africa. MPX virus infection is confirmed using the conventional polymerase chain reaction, which detects the viral DNA in samples from the rash. Of concern is that the current outbreak has affected five regions of the world. Although MPX confirmatory tests are available worldwide, there are concerns about Africa's capacity to diagnose and contain the disease. The challenges faced by Africa include a lack of adequate laboratory infrastructure and health care workers, weak disease surveillance systems, and a lack of MPX knowledge among health care workers and communities. These challenges can be addressed by mobilizing resources for MPX virus testing, strengthening surveillance systems, collaboration among countries, training health care workers, task shifting, and engaging communities.\n\n**Keywords:** Monkeypox, Diagnosis, Containment, Africa\n\n## Introduction\n\nMonkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease caused by the MPX virus (MPXV), which is a member of the poxviridae family, chordopoxvirinae subfamily, and orthopoxvirus genus. It is endemic in central and western Africa. MPX was first discovered in laboratory monkeys at a research facility in Denmark in 1958. Although it was first discovered in monkeys, African rodents are believed to be the natural reservoir. MPX infections occur in squirrels, rats, mice, monkeys, prairie dogs, and human beings. The first reported case of MPX in human beings was reported in 1970, when the virus was isolated from a child in the Democratic Republic of Congo suspected of smallpo ( [Ligon, 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0006)). Two genetic clades of MPX that have been characterized include the more common West African clade and the Central African clade. The West African clade has no documented human-to-human transmission and has a case fatality rate of less than 1%, whereas the Central African clade has reported human-to-human transmission and has a case fatality rate of up to 10%. Since the first MPX case was reported, several MPX outbreaks have occurred in Afric ( [Sklenovská and Van Ranst, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0014)). African countries that have experienced MPX outbreaks include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Liberi ( [Sklenovská and Van Ranst, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0014)). Outside Africa, an outbreak occurred in the United States in 2003, where 53 cases were reporte ( [Ligon, 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0006)). From January to June 22, 2022, 3413 laboratory-confirmed cases of MPX have been reported from 50 countries worldwide, covering five regions of the world, with one fatality ( [WHO, 2022a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0016)). The five regions are the Americas, Africa, Europe, eastern Mediterranean, and the western Pacific. About 86% of the confirmed cases are from Europe, 11% from the Americas, and 2% from Africa ( [WHO, 2022a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0016)).\n\nRisk factors for MPX infection include living in heavily forested and rural areas of central and western Africa, handling and preparing bushmeat, and caring for someone infected with MPXV ( [Rimoin _et al._, 2010](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0013)). MPX transmission from animals to human beings occurs when human beings get bitten by an animal infected with the disease or have direct contact with the animal's lesions or body fluids. Human-to-human transmission occurs during direct contact with body fluids of an infected person or objects contaminated with the virus and through respiratory droplets. The incubation period ranges from 5 to 21 days ( [WHO, 2022a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0016)). The signs and symptoms are the same as those of smallpox, although they are usually milder. Patients typically present with fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, and a feeling of discomfort and exhaustion. Lymphadenopathy during the prodromal stage of the illness is a clinical feature that can be used to distinguish it from smallpox or chickenpox. A vesicular and pustular rash such as that of smallpox develops within 1-3 days after the onset of fever. Initially, the rash is papular; however, it then progresses to vesiculation, pustulation, and finally, crusting. These different rash stages are found simultaneously on the face, head, trunk, and extremities. The illness typically lasts 2-4 week ( [Ligon, 2004](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0006)). Confirmation of the infection requires laboratory evidence ( [Osadebe _et al._, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0011)). This review will discuss the available testing and diagnosis methods for MPX infection; Africa's capacity for testing, diagnosing, and containing the disease; and our recommendations for the continent.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nConfirmation of MPXV infection is based on nucleic acid amplification testing using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of unique sequences of the viral DNA. Samples should be from the skin lesions’ roof, dry crusts, or fluid from vesicles and pustules. Lesion samples must be stored in dry, sterile tubes, refrigerated or frozen within an hour of collection, and transported as soon as possible after collection ( [WHO, 2022b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0017)). Although PCR is the preferred laboratory test for confirming MPX infection, other alternatives can be used for diagnosis. However, these alternatives have limitations. The alternatives include biopsy for culture, PCR blood tests, serum studies for antibody detection, visualization on electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining for orthopoxvirus antigens, and case definition criteria. Serum antibodies are detectable by the time the lesions appear. However, by this time, the patient will already be contagious because infectivity starts when the fever starts. The fever starts within the first 5 days after infection; however, lesions appear up to 3 days after the onset of fever. PCR blood tests are usually inconclusive because of the short duration of viremia relative to the timing of specimen collection after symptoms begin. Antigen and antibody detection methods do not provide MPX-specific confirmation because orthopoxviruses are serologically cross-reactive. Trained clinicians will be required to collect the biopsy samples if a culture is to be performed, making this option less feasibl ( [McCollum and Damon, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0008)). Using case definitions may also not be feasible because the disease may need to be differentiated from other diseases such as smallpox, chickenpox, scabies, measles, generalized vaccinia, and eczema herpeticum ( [Osadebe _et al._, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0011)).\n\n## Africa's capacity for diagnosing and containing the disease\n\nAs a result of the reinforced laboratory capacity in the wake of COVID-19, all African countries have PCR machines needed to test for MPXV. However, only seven countries in Africa can sequence the MPXV. Another challenge African countries face in diagnosing MPX is the lack of reagents and training in specimen collection, handling, and testing. In addition, some areas in Africa have health care facilities that do not have refrigerators or reliable power supply to keep the specimens viable until they are transported to centers where the tests will be performed. Moreover, there are remote areas in Africa that are not easily accessible by any means of transport ( [WHO, 2022c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0018)).\n\nThere is a shortage of health care workers in Africa, making it difficult for countries to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation. Although integrating common features of MPX into its case definition has been found to raise the definition specificity to 85%, 50% of actual MPX cases will still be missed ( [Mande _et al._, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0007)). In addition, health care providers in many African countries lack the knowledge and experience to recognize and diagnose MPX. Furthermore, infection prevention and control techniques and supplies are usually lacking in African rural health facilities ( [Durski _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0004)).\n\nThe tools required to contain the MPX outbreak, such as diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, and intense surveillance systems, are not readily available or accessible to most African countrie ( [Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0002)). Although the smallpox vaccine can prevent MPXV, the vaccine has since been discontinued after the disease was declared eradicated in 1980. Even if manufacturers start producing the vaccine again, it will take time to reach African countries because they usually prioritize high-income countries, as they did with the COVID-19 vaccin ( [Tatar et al., 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0015)). In most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, routine data from health management information systems are rarely assessed for quality, analyzed, or used for decision making. Several studies in sub-Saharan Africa identified weaknesses in the identification and recording of cases at primary health centers. Other deficiencies affecting the quality of data collected for surveillance of infectious diseases include capturing incomplete data and the inconsistency of the data at different levels of the surveillance system. This has been attributed to low motivation, inadequate health management information systems–related resources, and lack of skills among health care workers owing to the lack of training. In addition, the data collected are sometimes not analyzed, and there is no feedback on the data. Delayed outbreak detection and reporting of cases affect the operationalization of prevention and control strategies, leading to the further spread of the disease ( [Mremi _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0009)).\n\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on lessons from previous outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the previous Ebola viral disease outbreaks, we proposed several recommendations on how to improve Africa's capacity for diagnosing and containing the MPX disease. The lessons learned from the previous outbreaks were that surveillance and testing capacities in most African countries were weak, leading to delays in identifying the outbreaks. Furthermore, there was a failure to collect, analyze, and disseminate data. These issues delayed the mobilization of local and international support to institute effective public health responses ( [Afolabi _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0001)).\n\n### Mobilizing resources for testing\n\nAfrican countries must come together and set up a task force to coordinate the mobilization of resources for MPXV testing. The task force should seek donations from international organizations and within African countries. They can also borrow capital from international lending organizations, such as the Africa Development Bank and the World Bank, to finance laboratory capacity building that will ensure that the continent can test for MPXV ( [Ahanhanzo _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0003)). Regional reference laboratory systems should be established in the continent to support diagnostic assay quality assurance and confirmation ( [Durski _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0004)). The task force should also request material and technical support from organizations, such as the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and manufacturers. With enough support, the continent should rapidly expand national diagnostic capacity in all countries. There should also be laboratory network integration, which can facilitate integrated electronic reporting systems to ensure that laboratory tests guide patient care ( [Ahanhanzo _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0003); [Naidoo and Ihekweazu, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0010)).\n\n### Strengthening surveillance systems\n\nMPX surveillance systems strengthening in Africa can be achieved by ensuring that academic institutions are encouraged to conduct research that can be used for disease surveillance. Demographic surveillance sites can also be used to collect disease surveillance data during outbreaks. Within countries, information should be shared among departments with morbidity and mortality data to ensure that the disease is accurately characterized ( [Mremi _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0009)). There should also be MPX mandatory reporting to improve systematic reporting of the disease. Contact tracing should also be implemented because it will allow for early diagnosis of cases ( [Durski _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0004)). The continent should also use digital disease surveillance, which involves the use of data generated outside the health system for disease surveillance because there is high coverage of cellular phone services on the continent ( [Mremi _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0009)). Apart from MPX surveillance on humans, there should also be active surveillance on animals ( [Eteng _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0005)).\n\n### Collaboration\n\nCoordination and communication between human and veterinary health services should be improved within and among countries to ensure that animal outbreaks are quickly communicated to health care personnel who will institute prevention measures needed to prevent the spread of the disease to human ( [Reynolds et al., 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0012)). There should also be a collaboration of ministries of health of different countries. African governments must establish an intercountry early warning system for infectious disease outbreaks. Multicountry collaboration must involve sharing experiences about the disease and alerting neighboring countries of cases of MPX in both animals and human beings ( [Durski _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0004)).\n\n### Health care worker training and task shifting\n\nAfrica's capacity to deal with the MPX outbreak requires trained health care workers. Laboratory staff should be trained in MPXV testing procedures; the types of specimens; and safe sample collecting, storing, and transporting methods. Training clinicians is essential because it will allow them to diagnose and manage MPX cases. Furthermore, lower-level health cadres must be trained to identify suspected cases of MPX and refer them to health care facilities for further confirmatory tests and management ( [Durski _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0004)).\n\n### Community engagement and education\n\nCommunities must be warned about impending outbreaks early so that they can prepare and take preventive measures to reduce morbidity and mortality ( [Mremi _et al._, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0009)). There should be a communication of risk messages to communities at large and specific populations at high risk, such as sex workers, immunocompromised individuals, and childre ( [Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0002)). Messages that should be emphasized include reducing human contact with suspect animals, avoiding physical contact with infected individuals, frequent handwashing, and early medical examination of suspected cases ( [Eteng _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0005)). Measures to improve infection prevention and control include contact precautions, appropriate disinfection, and limited contact with patients ( [Durski _et al._, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534167/#bib0004)).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMPX is endemic in central and western Africa. Several outbreaks have been reported in several African countries before 2022. The diagnosis of MPXV infection is confirmed using conventional PCR to detect the viral DNA in samples from the rash. There are concerns about Africa's ability to diagnose and contain MPX emanating from inadequate laboratory infrastructure and health care workers, weak disease surveillance systems, and a lack of MPX knowledge among health care workers and communities. These challenges can be addressed by implementing lessons learned from previous outbreaks, which include mobilizing resources, strengthening surveillance systems, collaboration among countries, training health care workers, task shifting, and engaging communities.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Enos Moyo:** Writing – original draft. **Godfrey Musuka:** Writing – original draft. **Grant Murewanhema:** Writing – review & editing. **Perseverance Moyo:** Writing – review & editing. **Tafadzwa Dzinamarira:** Conceptualization, Writing – review & editing.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n### Conflict of interest\n\nThe authors have no known competing interests to declare.\n\n### Funding\n\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n### Ethical approval statement\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## References\n\n01.

The worldwide outbreak of MPXV in 2022 has caused widespread concerns. Cross-reactive antibodies induced by vaccinia-inoculation can provide protection against reinfection by MPXV. The [vaccinia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vaccinia \"Learn more about vaccinia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") Tian Tan (VTT) strain, which was widely inoculated in the Chinese population before the 1980s, has genomic differences from other [vaccinia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/vaccinia \"Learn more about vaccinia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") strains, although they all belong to the orthopoxviruses family. The current [seroprevalence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/seroprevalence \"Learn more about seroprevalence from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of VTT-vaccinated populations remains unclear more than four decades after the termination of [vaccination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/vaccination-policy \"Learn more about vaccination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") campaigns in China. Our results showed that cross-reactive [IgG antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/immunoglobulin-g-antibody \"Learn more about IgG antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") against MPXV were present in 31.8% (75/236) of vaccinees four decades after VTT-vaccination, suggesting that [vaccination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/vaccination-policy \"Learn more about vaccination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with VTT may provide long-term protection against [MPXV infection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/monkeypox \"Learn more about MPXV infection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in some individuals.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713482300076X)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000734)\n\n## Keywords\n\nMonkeypox virus\n\nVaccinia Tian Tan strain\n\nCross-reactive antibodies\n\nSeroprevalence\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe [monkeypox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/monkeypox \"Learn more about monkeypox from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") virus (MPXV) is a double-stranded [DNA virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/dna-virus \"Learn more about DNA virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") belonging to the genus [Orthopoxvirus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/orthopoxvirus \"Learn more about Orthopoxvirus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of the family [Poxviridae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/poxviridae \"Learn more about Poxviridae from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). It has two [genetic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/genetics \"Learn more about genetic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") branches, the Central African and West African branches ( [Theves et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0155)). MPXV can be transmitted from animals to humans and from human to human through droplets, body fluids, or contact ( [Alakunle et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0010)). Mpox caused by [MPXV infection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monkeypox \"Learn more about MPXV infection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is a [zoonotic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/zoonotic \"Learn more about zoonotic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") infection with common symptoms that include fever, [headache](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/headache \"Learn more about headache from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), and [myalgia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/myalgia \"Learn more about myalgia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Adler et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0005); [Xiang and White, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0170)). A distinctive feature of [MPXV infection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/monkeypox \"Learn more about MPXV infection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is [swollen lymph nodes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/lymphadenopathy \"Learn more about swollen lymph nodes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), with a [mortality rate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/mortality-rate \"Learn more about mortality rate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ranging from 0% to 11% ( [McCollum and Damon, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0115); [Bunge et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0025)). Before 2003, monkeypox was often considered an [endemic disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endemic-disease \"Learn more about endemic disease from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in central and western Africa. However, since this century, and especially since May 2022, mpox outbreaks have been reported in non-MPXV endemic areas. These outbreaks are characterized by rapid transmission, unknown origin, interpersonal transmission, and accelerated [virus mutation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/virus-mutation \"Learn more about virus mutation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). Monkeypox has caused widespread concern worldwide, and the World Health Organization has classified it as a “public health emergency of international concern” ( [Hraib et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0075)). As of June 21, 2023, the monkeypox epidemic has affected 111 countries or regions worldwide, with a total of 88,026 reported cases and 148 deaths. The first imported case of Mpox was reported in mainland China on September 16, 2022 ( [Huang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0080)). This suggests that we should always be on high alert for possible imported epidemics and deeply understand the importance of “external prevention of importation” and the necessity and urgency of protecting high-risk populations.\n\nFor Orthopoxviruses, [vaccination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/vaccination-policy \"Learn more about vaccination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") is an effective strategy to prevent and control infection. However, there is currently no effective vaccine for the prevention of [MPXV infection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/viral-disease \"Learn more about MPXV infection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The central region of the [smallpox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/smallpox \"Learn more about smallpox from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") virus shows 96.3% similarity to the MPXV sequence. This region contains information for the most essential [enzymes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/enzyme \"Learn more about enzymes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and [structural proteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/structural-protein \"Learn more about structural proteins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Altayb, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0015)). Previous investigations have pointed out that [Vaccinia virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/vaccinia-virus \"Learn more about Vaccinia virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (VACV) offers cross-reactive immunity to MPXV. Antibodies produced by [vaccination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/vaccination-policy \"Learn more about vaccination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") with VACV exhibit cross-neutralization for several orthopoxvirus species ( [Gilchuk et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0050)). It has been shown that the [smallpox vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/smallpox-vaccine \"Learn more about smallpox vaccine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") produced 85% protection against infection with Orthopoxviruses, including MPXV, through cross-reactivity and protection ( [Yoshikawa, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0175)). Antibodies have the critical capacity to neutralize viruses and protect the host against viral infection. VACV-induced antibodies are necessary and sufficient for protection against MPXV in macaques ( [Edghill-Smith et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0045)).\n\nChina officially implemented a universal [smallpox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/smallpox \"Learn more about smallpox from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") vaccination policy for people from 1950 to 1981. The domestic Vaccinia Tian Tan (VTT) strain has made an outstanding contribution to the control and eradication of [smallpox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smallpox \"Learn more about smallpox from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in China ( [Ma Xiang and Kunling, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0110)). Routine VTT vaccination of the general population in China ended in 1981. People born after 1981 have no existing immunity to smallpox. It has been reported that the seroprevalence of smallpox antibodies in different age populations was 53–80% after ten years of VTT vaccination ( [Li et al., 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0070)). Studies have reported that orthopoxvirus-specific immunity induced by VACV vaccination is long-lived, with [antibody responses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/antibody-response \"Learn more about antibody responses from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") being maintained up to 75 years after vaccination ( [Hammarlund et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0060)). However, immunity to smallpox or MPXV remains unknown after four decades of VTT vaccination.\n\nIn this study, we assessed [MPXV antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/virus-antibody \"Learn more about MPXV antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the populations four decades after VTT vaccination to preliminarily evaluate baseline data on seroprevalence among this population. It may also provide support data for populations at high risk of MPXV exposure to emergency vaccination with VTT.\n\n## 2\\. Material and method\n\n### 2.1. Study population\n\nWe collected serum from a medical study population in Beijing, China, in October 2022. A total of 236 serum samples were collected from adults aged 45 to 55 years who had been vaccinated with VTT between 1968 and 1978, consisting of 100 males and 136 were females. Additionally, 78 serum samples were obtained from children aged 0 to 10 years who had not been vaccinated with VTT and served as control group.\n\n### 2.2. Elisa\n\nWe detected MPXV [IgG antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/immunoglobulin-g-antibody \"Learn more about IgG antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") in the collected serum using [ELISA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay \"Learn more about ELISA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") kits from Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd. The [MPXV glycoproteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/virus-glycoprotein \"Learn more about MPXV glycoproteins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") A29L, A35R, B6R, and M1R were coated on [ELISA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/elisa \"Learn more about ELISA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") plates, and the assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. The assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting anti-MPXV IgG. During each run, positive and negative controls provided by the manufacturer were included. The samples were diluted 1:100 using diluent, and 50 μL of properly diluted sample was added to the test sample well. The plate was then sealed with a cover and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. After removing the cover and discarding the plate content, and plate was washed three times with Wash Buffer. Subsequently, 50 μL of HRP-labeled antibody working solution was added to the above wells, avoiding touching the sidewall. The plate was again covered and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cover was then removed, and the plate was washed five times with Wash Buffer, letting the Wash Buffer stay in the wells for 1–2 min each time. Finally, 50 μL of TMB substrate was added to each well, the plate was covered and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 10–15 min. Then, 50 μL Stop Solution was added to each well, and the O.D. absorbance at 450 nm was immediately measured in a microplate reader. The concentration of the sample MPXV IgG was calculated from the standard curve, and the sample was considered positive when the concentration was greater than 1.875 ng/mL.\n\n### 2.3. B-cell antigen gene homology analysis\n\nTo screen B-cell epitopes of each protein, we obtained the [amino acid sequences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/peptide-sequence \"Learn more about amino acid sequences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of [MPXV proteins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/viral-protein \"Learn more about MPXV proteins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") A29L, A35R, B6R, and M1R from the Swissport [Protein Database](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/protein-database \"Learn more about Protein Database from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). We then used DNA Star [Protean](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/proteans \"Learn more about Protean from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), Deleage&Roux, Gamier-Robson, Chou-Fasmanz, and [ExPASy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/expasy \"Learn more about ExPASy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") software to perform B-cell epitope screening. Additionally, we conducted a homology analysis of the screened [amino acid sequences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/amino-acid-sequence \"Learn more about amino acid sequences from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") using Protein BLAST software.\n\n### 2.4. Ethical approval\n\nThe procedures performed in this study were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University (\\[2022\\]-E-195-Y) and the Declaration of Helsinki. The collected blood samples were leftover samples obtained from adult donors over 40 years of age for preliminary basic testing in the transfusion department of our hospital. Before sample collection, the donors were required to report their vaccination history and history of infection with chronic and major infectious diseases, and were informed that the remaining samples might be used for scientific research. The study was retrospective and did not pose any additional risks to the donors. The donors' real identification information was erased and de-identified at the time of the statistical data, and no leakage of the donor privacy occurred.\n\n### 2.5. Statistical analysis\n\nWe performed statistical analysis using SPSS 22.0 software. The Chi-square test was employed to compare the difference in seroprevalence between males and females, and the comparison was considered statistically significant when the _P_ value was less than 0.05.\n\n## 3\\. Results\n\n### 3.1. High homology of complete genome and B-cell antigen gene of VTT, VACV and MPXV strains\n\nThree generations of [VACV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/vaccinia-virus \"Learn more about VACV from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") have been available for use in other countries. Firstly, we compared the genome sequences of VTT, [VACV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vaccinia-virus \"Learn more about VACV from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and MPXV stains (Central African branch: Zaire-96-I-16 strain; West African branches; MPXV isolate from Taiwan and mainland China) ( [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#t0005)), revealing that their genomes are 84.3%–89.2% and 81.3%–81.5% identical. Further, we analyzed the [gene homology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/sequence-homology \"Learn more about gene homology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of B-cell antigens (A29L, A35R, B6R, M1R) that can induce [neutralizing antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/neutralizing-antibody \"Learn more about neutralizing antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") against VTT, [VACV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/vaccinia-virus \"Learn more about VACV from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") and MPXV. The results showed that the nucleotide homology of the main B-cell antigen genes between VTT and VACV/MPXV was 97.4%–99.7%, and the [amino acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/amino-acid \"Learn more about amino acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") homology ranged from 93.8%–100% ( [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#t0010)).\n\nTable 1.

MPXV cross-antibodies are present in VTT vaccinees\n\nSera were collected from 236 [healthy adults](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/normal-human \"Learn more about healthy adults from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") aged 45–55 years and 78 healthy children aged 0–10 years in Beijing, China. All serum samples were tested for MPXV IgG using [ELISA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay \"Learn more about ELISA from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") kits. 75 of 236 adults (31.8%) were seropositive for [MPXV antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/virus-antibody \"Learn more about MPXV antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#f0005) A). Among them, 27 cases (27.0%) were positive in males, and 48 cases (35.3%) were positive in females. There was no statistical difference in seroprevalence between males and females. Seroprevalence showed an increasing trend among those aged 45 to 50 years, with 26.3% in 45–46 years, 35.5% in 47–48 years, and 37.8% in 49–50 years, while it decreased to 12.5% in those aged 51–55 years ( [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#f0005) B). 78 children aged 0–10 years who had not received VTT vaccination were negative for [MPXV antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/virus-antibody \"Learn more about MPXV antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"). The results show that four decades after vaccination, MPVX cross-antibodies are still present in a portion of VTT vaccinees.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1567134823000758-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

Analysis by sex (A) and age group for total, male and female individuals (B).\n\n## 4\\. Discussion\n\nOur findings showed that there was a B-cell antigen gene homology of 97.4%–99.7% between VTT and VACV/MPXV, with an [amino acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/amino-acid \"Learn more about amino acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") homology of 93.8%–100%. This indicates that VTT has the potential to induce cross-antibodies to MPXV. After four decades of VTT vaccination, 31.8% of the vaccinees demonstrated cross-reactive antibodies to MPXV. Vaccination stands as an effective measure to prevent infection, and vaccines including long-lasting immune responses resulting in durable protection are highly desired. After VACV vaccination, specific [antibody responses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/antibody-response \"Learn more about antibody responses from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") have been known to persist for over 75 years, and in some cases, for more than 90 years ( [Taub et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0150); [Kwanchum et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0100)). Studies have reported detecting vaccinia virus antibodies in 68.5% to 71% of individuals vaccinated before the 1970s in the Netherlands and Spain ( [Zaeck et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0180); [Sanz-Munoz et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0135)). Interestingly, when people vaccinated against vaccinia in the 1970s were re-vaccinated with the MVA-BN vaccine, antibodies increased rapidly, revealing a similar rate of response to memory antibodies induced by re-vaccination with the MVA-BN vaccine. This implies that the [vaccinia vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/vaccinia-vaccine \"Learn more about vaccinia vaccine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") fosters long-lasting B-cell [immune memory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/immunological-memory \"Learn more about immune memory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), which can provide protection even in the [absence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/epileptic-absence \"Learn more about absence from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of persistent antibodies ( [Ilchmann et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0085)). Many vaccines have shown to provide protective immune responses that last for decades after vaccination, such as the SA14–14-2 strain of [Japanese encephalitis virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/japanese-encephalitis-virus-group \"Learn more about Japanese encephalitis virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (JEV) that still shows high levels of [neutralizing antibody](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/neutralizing-antibody \"Learn more about neutralizing antibody from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") production even after 20 years ( [Wang et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0165)). Similarly, vaccine-induced [measles antibodies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/measles-antibody \"Learn more about measles antibodies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") have been detected 26–33 years after vaccination ( [Dine et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0040)), and immunity for [Hepatitis B Virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/hepatitis-b-virus \"Learn more about Hepatitis B Virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") has persisted for 20 years post-vaccination ( [Coppeta et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0030)). Antibody responses elicited from [tetanus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tetanus \"Learn more about tetanus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") vaccination have been long-lived and have the potential to provide lifelong protection against [tetanus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/tetanus \"Learn more about tetanus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Hammarlund et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0065)).\n\nAll serum samples were collected in Beijing, China, and none of the participants had any history or symptoms of mpox. These participants also denied any residency or travel history to MPXV-endemic areas, indicating that exposure to MPXV was less likely. Despite this, antibodies reacting with the antigen of MPXV were present in the participants' serum, suggesting that VTT has the ability to induce the production of cross-reactive MPXV antibody. However, due to limitations, we were unable to procure MPXV or [pseudovirus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/pseudovirus \"Learn more about pseudovirus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") particles to conduct antibody neutralization experiments to demonstrate the cross-protective effect of VTT. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that antibodies in the serum of recovered orthopox infection donors, or those previously immunized with VAVC, can be mostly cross-neutralizing to multiple [orthopoxviruses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/orthopoxvirus \"Learn more about orthopoxviruses from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Gilchuk et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0050)). VACV has demonstrated its ability to promote the production of MPXV-neutralizing antibodies that guard cells from [MPXV infections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/monkeypox \"Learn more about MPXV infections from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") for 40 years after inoculation, with MPXV cross antibodies being detected in all VACV-antibody-positive individuals, while serum VACV-reactive antibodies that are unable to be neutralized by MPXV return negative results. ( [Criscuolo et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0035); [Zaeck et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0180); [Criscuolo et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0035)). Furthermore, antibody-mediated depletion of B cells, but not CD4+ or [CD8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/cd8-antigen \"Learn more about CD8 from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")+[T cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/t-cell \"Learn more about T cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), has been found to abolish vaccine-induced protection from a lethal intravenous challenge with MPXV ( [Edghill-Smith et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0045)). In previous studies, VACV protected macaques against respiratory challenges with MPXV and non-human primates against a lethal MPXV challenge ( [Stittelaar et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0140); [Buchman et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0020)). Most viral vaccines are known to provide partial protection through the induction of neutralizing antibodies ( [Plotkin, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0125)). Therefore, the MPXV cross-reactive antibodies produced after VTT vaccination are likely to be MPXV neutralizing antibodies.\n\nThe protective effect of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies has been demonstrated in viral infections. We have previously demonstrated that a Zika [DNA vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/dna-vaccine \"Learn more about DNA vaccine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") can protect against [dengue virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/dengue-virus \"Learn more about dengue virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (DENV) infection through a cross-reactive [humoral response](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/humoral-immunity \"Learn more about humoral response from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Wang et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0160)). Additionally, cross-reactive antibodies induced by JEV vaccination have been shown to play important roles in cross-protection against DENV and [West Nile virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/west-nile-virus \"Learn more about West Nile virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Li et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0105); [Kotaki et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0095)). Similarly, several groups have reported that antibodies isolated from individuals with prior DENV infections cross-neutralize [Zika virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/zika-virus \"Learn more about Zika virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") (ZIKV) and provide cross-protection in [animal models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/animal-model \"Learn more about animal models from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of [ZIKV infection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/zika-fever \"Learn more about ZIKV infection from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") ( [Swanstrom et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0145); [Pedroso et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0120); [Zhou et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0185); [Katzelnick et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0090)). Notably, while antibodies following VTT vaccination are likely to be MPXV-neutralizing antibodies, breakthrough [MPXV infections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/monkeypox \"Learn more about MPXV infections from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") have been reported in vaccinees ( [Raccagni et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0130)). Further, it has been demonstrated that the VACV-based modified Ankara vaccine, a new generation [smallpox vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/smallpox-vaccine \"Learn more about smallpox vaccine from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\"), induces lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against MPXV ( [Zaeck et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0180)), making it difficult to assess the protective effect of these antibodies against mpox infection. In our study, the MPXV antibody positive rate was 31.5% in the 45–55-year age group, and there was no [neutralizing antibody](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/neutralizing-antibody \"Learn more about neutralizing antibody from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") present in the unvaccinated group. China's population over the age of 45 comprises around 42.2% of the population, thereby suggesting an overall positive rate of only 13.2%. The proportion of immunized individuals can effectively halt the virus's transmission. Studies have indicated that the mpox epidemic can only be suppressed when immunization reaches 50.25%–65.28% of the population ( [Gushchin et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134823000758#bb0055)). Thus, the residual immune effect after previous VTT inoculation may not be sufficient to effectively inhibit the transmission of MPXV in the population.\n\nAs the [smallpox virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/smallpox-virus \"Learn more about smallpox virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") has been eradicated worldwide, no [smallpox virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/smallpox-virus \"Learn more about smallpox virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") lgG [antibody test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/immunoassay \"Learn more about antibody test from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") kit is available. Therefore, we were unable to assay [smallpox virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/smallpox-virus \"Learn more about smallpox virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") antibodies. We speculate that the [smallpox virus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/smallpox-virus \"Learn more about smallpox virus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") antibody positive rate in VTT vaccinated populations is higher than 31.5%. In this study, we examined the serum MPXV antibodies in children aged 0–10 years and those aged 45–55 years. Supplementing the results with other age groups would be helpful in a more comprehensive evaluation of the baseline of [herd immunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/herd-immunity \"Learn more about herd immunity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") to MPXV.\n\nIn conclusion, our results provide the first domestic data on the prevalence of positive MPXV antibodies in a population four decades after VTT vaccination in China. Although the antibody positivity in VTT vaccinees has decreased after four decades years, 31.5% of VTT vaccine recipients still had MPXV cross-reactive antibodies. A considerable portion of the VTT vaccinated population did not have MPXV antibodies, and no MPXV antibodies were detected in the unvaccinated population, suggesting that these individuals are susceptible to MPXV. Moreover, the [residual effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/residual-effects \"Learn more about residual effect from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\") of previous VTT vaccination may not inhibit the transmission of MPXV.\n\n## Ethical statement\n\nThe procedures performed in this study were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University (\\[2022\\]-E-195-Y) and the Declaration of Helsinki. The collected blood samples were leftover samples obtained from adult donors over 40 years of age for preliminary basic testing in the transfusion department of our hospital. Before sample collection, the donors were required to report their vaccination history and history of infection with chronic and major infectious diseases, and were informed that the remaining samples might be used for scientific research. The study was retrospective and did not pose any additional risks to the donors. The donors' real identification information was erased and de-identified at the time of the statistical data, and no leakage of the donor privacy occurred.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Zida Zhen:** Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft. **Linlin Zhang:** Investigation, Methodology.

The surface proteins M1R and B6R of MPXV are crucial for virus transmission and serve as key targets for vaccine development. In this study, a panel of human antibodies targeting M1R and B6R is isolated from a human antibody library using phage display technology. Among these antibodies, A138 against M1R and B026 against B6R show the most potent broad-spectrum neutralizing activities against MPXV and Vaccinia virus (VACV). When used in combination, A138 and B026 exhibit complementary neutralizing activity against both viruses in vitro. X-ray crystallography reveales that A138 binds to the loop regions of M1R, similar to the vulnerable epitope of 7D11 on VACV L1R. By contrast, A129 targets a more cryptic epitope, primarily comprising the β-strands of M1R. Moreover, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of A138 or B026 alone provides partial protection, while combining these two antibodies results in enhanced protection against VACV in male C57BL/6 mice. This study demonstrates of a dual-targeting strategy using two different components of the virion for the prevention and treatment of MPXV infection.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41421-025-00771-7/MediaObjects/41421_2025_771_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Identification of neutralizing nanobodies protecting against poxvirus infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-025-00771-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access25 March 2025\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-48312-2/MediaObjects/41467_2024_48312_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Two noncompeting human neutralizing antibodies targeting MPXV B6 show protective effects against orthopoxvirus infections](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48312-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access31 May 2024\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-61699-w/MediaObjects/41467_2025_61699_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [A multivalent mRNA vaccine elicits robust immune responses and confers protection in a murine model of monkeypox virus infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61699-w?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access09 August 2025\n\n## Introduction\n\nMonkeypox virus (MPXV) a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus and is primarily restricted to rural tropical rainforest areas of West and Central Africa[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR1 \"Khodakevich, L., Jezek, Z. & Messinger, D.

Notably, the 2022 MPXV differs from the related 2018–2019 strains by an average of 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR12 \"Isidro, J. et al.

Three amino acid changes (D209N, P722S, and M1741I) occurred in the key antibody target surface glycoprotein B21[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR14 \"Hammarlund, E. et al.

However, it remains unclear whether and how these genetic variations drive the epidemiological phenotype. Currently, the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms on immunogenic surface glycoprotein[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR14 \"Hammarlund, E. et al.

G. & Damon, I. K. Outbreaks of human monkeypox after cessation of smallpox vaccination. Trends Microbiol 20, 80–87 (2012).\") are considered to be the main reasons for the immune evasion and accelerated transmission of MPXV.\n\nAntibodies play a critical role in providing immunity against Orthopoxviruses[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR17 \"Kempe, C. H. et al. The use of vaccinia hyperimmune gamma-globulin in the prophylaxis of smallpox. Bull. World Health Organ 25, 41–48 (1961).\"), and previous studies have shown that polyclonal antibodies are effective in providing protection against lethal challenges with MPXV or vaccinia virus (VACV) in non-human primates and mice[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR18 \"Belyakov, I. M. et al. Shared modes of protection against poxvirus infection by attenuated and conventional smallpox vaccine viruses. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100, 9458–9463 (2003).\"). Vaccinia immune globulin, derived from antiserum elicited by vaccinia vaccine, is an approved treatment for complications associated with smallpox vaccination. However, its use is limited by availability, low specific activity, and the risk of contamination with blood-borne infectious agents. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of protective antibodies for the prevention and treatment of MPXV infections. However, the complex proteome of Orthopoxviruses, as well as the diversity of viral particles, including mature virions (MV) or enveloped virions (EV)[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR19 \"Moss, B. Smallpox vaccines: targets of protective immunity. Immunol. Rev. 239, 8–26 (2011).\"), poses challenges in definitively identifying suitable antigens for the development of therapeutic antibodies.\n\nCurrently, the majority of available neutralizing antibodies developed against Orthopoxviruses have been developed based on VACV antigens, with only a few antibodies against MPXV antigens[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR20 \"Li, M. et al.

Identification of mpox M1R and B6R monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that efficiently neutralize authentic mpox virus. Emerg. Microbes Infect. 13, 2401931 (2024).\"). Previous studies using mouse models of VACV infection have identified several surface proteins of MV and EV as targets for neutralizing and protective antibodies, including A27L, L1R, H3L, D8L, A28L, A13L, and A17L for MV, as well as B5R and A33R for EV[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR19 \"Moss, B. Smallpox vaccines: targets of protective immunity. Immunol. Rev. 239, 8–26 (2011).\"). Six principal antibodies essential for cross-neutralization and protection against infection with four Orthopoxvirus species have also been identified, targeting various VACV antigens such as D8L, H3L, A27L, L1R for MV, as well as B5R and A33R for EV. Investigations into various human mAb formulations suggest that the incorporation of antibodies targeting both MV and EV antigens is crucial for providing adequate protection against Orthopoxvirus challenge in animals[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR23 \"Gilchuk, I. et al. Cross-neutralizing and protective human antibody specificities to poxvirus infections. Cell 167, 684–694.e689 (2016).\"). Additionally, studies on multicomponent mRNA vaccine candidates against MPXV have demonstrated that vaccine formulations containing M1R and B6R exhibit superior efficacy in eliciting neutralizing and protective antibodies rather than those without M1R and B6R[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR24 \"Zhang, R. R. et al. Rational development of multicomponent mRNA vaccine candidates against mpox. Emerg.

Four-gene-combination DNA vaccine protects mice against a lethal vaccinia virus challenge and elicits appropriate antibody responses in nonhuman primates. Virology 306, 181–195 (2003).\"). In summary, although numerous antigens have been identified as neutralization targets in Orthopoxviruses, the surface antigens consistently included in subunit vaccines are L1R/M1R for MV and B5R/B6R for EV. Therefore, we primarily focused on M1R on the surface of MV and B6R on the surface of EV for screening and isolation of neutralizing antibodies against MPXV.\n\nIn this work, we employed phage display technology to generate a large panel of MPXV-specific human antibodies targeting M1R and B6R, after which we evaluated their binding and neutralizing activity. We also examined the cross-reactivity of individual antibody administration, two-antibody combinations and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) against both VACV and MPXV in vitro. Our findings revealed that among the antibodies generated in this study, the combined use of two antibodies targeting two different MPXV antigens or their corresponding bsAbs exhibited superior neutralizing activity compared to the single antibodies targeting M1R or B6R alone. Furthermore, we defined the binding epitopes of M1R and B6R antibodies through X-ray crystallography and biochemical analyzes. Our results demonstrated that A138 binds to M1R at an epitope similar to that of the previously reported mouse antibody 7D11[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR26 \"Su, H. P., Golden, J. W., Gittis, A. G., Hooper, J. W. & Garboczi, D. N. Structural basis for the binding of the neutralizing antibody, 7D11, to the poxvirus L1 protein. Virology 368, 331–341 (2007).\") targeting VACV L1R, whereas A129 binds to a previously unreported epitope. Additionally, the B6R antibody B026 binds to the stalk region of B6R, while B019 primarily binds to domain 4 of B6R. Lastly, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of single antibodies and antibody combinations in mouse models of VACV and MPXV infection. In agreement with our in vitro neutralization assays, the two-antibody combination exhibited a more potent protective effect than single antibodies. Taken together, our findings suggest that a dual-targeting strategy utilizing two different components of MPXV antigens, M1R and B6R, may offer a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of MPXV infection.\n\n## Results\n\n### Isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting MPXV M1R and B6R\n\nIn this study, we employed phage surface display technology to identify a diverse and extensive array of antibodies targeting M1R and B6R proteins on the surface of MPXV (Fig. [1A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1)). The M1R and B6R antibodies were isolated from a fully human antibody library (ST-ST-HuNAL, Fab format, Sanyou Bio), which was constructed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from more than 2000 healthy donors aged between 20 and 60 years. To isolate the target antibodies, we adopted a standard solid-phase immuno tube screening strategy (Fig. S [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). The recombinant M1R or B6R proteins were used as bait, and three rounds of panning were conducted (Fig. S [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1) and Table [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)), which respectively yielded 37 and 40 clones (Table [S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)), each exhibiting unique sequences. Subsequently, we sequenced the V regions and assessed the length of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3). Notably, IGHV3-23, IGHV3-30, IGHV3-66 and IGHV3-21, as well as IGKV1-12 and IGKV1-39, were found to be significantly prevalent among the M1R binding antibodies (Fig. [1B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1)). Similarly, antibodies targeting B6R also exhibited high frequencies in the IGHV3-23, IGHV3-30, IGKV1-12, and IGKV1-39 germlines (Fig. [1C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1)). Further analysis of the CDR3 length in these binding antibodies revealed values within the range of 8-10 amino acids. While the antibodies targeting B6R and M1R shared a similar average CDRH3 length, a higher number of B6R antibodies were found to possess longer CDRH3 compared to M1R antibodies (Fig. [1D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1)). Finally, we extracted plasmid DNA containing the coding sequences of the identified human antibodies and constructed full-length IgG1 constructs expression in Expi239F system.\n\n**Fig. 1: Isolation and characterization of the M1R and B6R antibodies.**\n\n[![figure 1](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig1_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/1)\n\n**A** Diagram of the EV and MV forms of MPXV.

Blank or excluded values were represent by an X in the corresponding table cells. No detective (N.D.) indicates that no response was observed at the highest concentration, while > 1000 or > 66.7 denotes that the EC50 or IC50 value of the antibody is higher than the maximum detectable concentration. Binding and neutralization curves are shown in Figure [S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/1)\n\nWe then assessed the binding and neutralizing activity of the antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), respectively (Figs. [1E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1) and S [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Overall, M1R antibodies showed slightly weaker binding affinities compared to B6R antibodies. Only a few M1R antibodies demonstrated remarkable binding affinity, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values below 1 ng/mL, including A046, A084 and A094, while the remaining antibodies displayed much lower binding activities with EC50 values above 20 ng/mL. By contrast, B6R antibodies showed robust binding activity, with the majority of clones exhibiting EC50 values below 10 ng/mL. Notably, B026, B046, B089, B161 and B177 exhibited particularly tight binding to B6R, with EC50 values below 0.5 ng/mL (Fig. [1E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1)). We further evaluated the in vitro neutralization capacity of M1R and B6R antibodies against replication-deficient MPXV[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR27 \"Liu J. et al. An efficient and safe trans-complementation system for MPXV mimicking authentic viral infection. bioRxiv                    https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.29.573498                                     (2023).\"). Specifically, MV forms of MPXV were utilized to evaluate the neutralization potency of M1R antibodies, while EV forms were employed to assess the neutralizing capacity of B6R antibodies. The potency of neutralization was determined using the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The IC50 values of most antibodies were above 1 nM, but three M1R antibodies (A061, A094, and A138) and four B6R (B026, B050, B083, and B161) antibodies demonstrated more potent neutralizing activity, with IC50 values below 0.5 nM. Notably, M1R antibody A138 and B6R antibody B026 stood out with the most potent neutralization activity (Fig. [1E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig1)).\n\nTo map out the epitopes of these antibodies, we performed a cross-competition assay using Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) (Fig. S [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Our findings revealed a spectrum of epitopes utilized by the tested antibodies. Notably, some of these epitopes overlapped with those recognized by previously reported antibodies, such as 7D11[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR26 \"Su, H. P., Golden, J. W., Gittis, A. G., Hooper, J. W. & Garboczi, D. N. Structural basis for the binding of the neutralizing antibody, 7D11, to the poxvirus L1 protein.

However, we also identified antibodies binding to novel epitopes that have not yet been characterized.\n\n### M1R and B6R antibodies exhibited cross-neutralization activity against VACV and MPXV\n\nNext, we evaluated the neutralizing activities of M1R and B6R antibodies against VACV and replication-deficient MPXV. Four antibodies (A138 and A129 against M1R, B026 and B019 against B6R) were chosen for the following cross-neutralization experiments considering their high expression level, differentiated neutralizing activity and varied binding epitopes. Here, we prepared EV and MV forms of VACV and replication-deficient MPXV for the neutralization assays with M1R and B6R antibodies (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) A, [B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)). Conversely, when assessed the combination of antibodies targeting different antigens, a mixture of EV and MV forms of VACV/MPXV was used (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) C, [D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)).\n\n**Fig. 2: Cross-neutralizing potency of M1R and B6R antibodies against VACV and replication-deficient MPXV.**\n\n[![figure 2](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig2_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/2)\n\n**A**, **B** Neutralizing activity of individual antibodies (A129, A138, B026, and B019) or antibody cocktail targeting the same antigens against MV and EV forms of replication-deficient MPXV ( **A**) and VACV ( **B**).

Conversely, the B6R antibodies demonstrated neutralization of the EV but not the MV form of MPXV (Fig. S [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). The neutralizing activity of A138 or A129 against MPXV and VACV was comparable (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) A, [B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)), in agreement with previous reports on the 7D11 antibody[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR29 \"Esqueda A. et al. A monoclonal antibody produced in glycoengineered plants potently neutralizes monkeypox virus. Vaccines (Basel) 11, 1179 (2023).\"), [30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR30 \"Wolffe, E. J., Vijaya, S. & Moss, B. A myristylated membrane protein encoded by the vaccinia virus L1R open reading frame is the target of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Virology 211, 53–63 (1995).\"). Similarly, the B6R antibodies B026 and B019 also exhibited a comparable neutralizing capacity against MPXV and VACV (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) A, [B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)). However, compared to B019, B026 exhibited stronger neutralizing activity against both MPXV and VACV (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) A, [B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)). Furthermore, we explored the combined effect of two antibodies targeting the same antigens against VACV and replication-deficient MPXV. The results suggested that mixing two antibodies (A129 + A138 or B019 + B026) led to no obvious enhancement of the neutralizing effect (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) A, [B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)).\n\nAdditionally, we conducted assessments on the neutralizing activities of M1R and B6R antibody combinations using a mixture of MV and EV forms of MPXV/VACV (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) C, [D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)). Notably, none of the individual M1R or B6R antibodies could entirely neutralize the combination of MV and EV of MPXV/VACV, even at the maximum concentration of 66.7 nM (10 μg/mL). However, the four combinations of M1R and B6R antibodies exhibited potent neutralizing activity, successfully neutralizing the mixture of MV and EV in both MPXV (Fig. [2C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)) and VACV (Fig. [2D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)). Among these combinations, the pairing of A138 and B026 exhibited the most robust neutralizing activity against MPXV and VACV, with IC50 values of 0.163 and 0.112 nM, respectively. Therefore, the neutralization and cross-neutralization of MPXV and VACV can be more effectively achieved by employing a combination of two antibodies targeting different antigens, rather than relying solely on a single antibody with a specific neutralization target.\n\n### Design and characterization of bispecific antibodies\n\nTo further increase the neutralizing potency and broaden the spectrum against MPXV and other Orthopoxviruses, we designed and synthesized seven bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) in IgG-ScFv format[31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR31 \"Su H. et al. potent bispecific neutralizing antibody targeting glycoprotein B and the gH/gL/pUL128/130/131 complex of human cytomegalovirus.

A bispecific broadly neutralizing antibody against enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 with therapeutic potential. Antivir.

Immunoglobulin domain crossover as a generic approach for the production of bispecific IgG antibodies. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 108, 11187–11192 (2011).\") based on A138 and B026 (Figs. [2E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) and S [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). All the bsAbs were successfully obtained as determined by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis (Fig. S [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). We evaluated the binding affinity of these bsAbs for M1R and B6R using BLI. Differentiated binding patterns were found in various forms of bsAbs (Figs. [2F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) and S [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Notably, ScFvA138B026 and ScFvB026A138 displayed robust binding to both M1R and B6R, whereas the remaining bsAbs exhibited lower or undetectable affinity (Figs. [2F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) and S [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). The binding affinity of ScFvA138B026 for M1R and B6R were determined to be 0.77 and 1.17 nM, respectively. For ScFvB026A138, the _K_ _D_ values were 7.7 and 0.74 nM for binding to M1R and B6R, respectively. Remarkably, the binding capacity of ScFvA138B026 and ScFvB026A138 was comparable to that of their parental antibodies (KD = 2.78 nM for A138 and M1R; KD = 0.53 nM for B026 and B6R) (Figs. [2F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) and. S [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)).\n\nNext, we further assessed the neutralizing efficacy of the these two bsAbs in IgG-ScFv format (ScFvA138B026 and ScFvB026A138) against VACV and replication-deficient MPXV. Interestingly, ScFvA138B026 demonstrated slightly superior neutralization compared to ScFvB026A138, with IC50 concentrations of 0.270 nM and 0.694 nM (IC50) for MPXV and VACV, respectively (Fig. [2G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2)). The enhanced neutralizing activity of ScFvA138B026 might be attributed to its stronger binding affinity for M1R and B6R. Despite the marginally lower neutralizing efficacy of ScFvA138B026 compared to the mixture of parental antibodies, it exhibited significantly better neutralization effects than B026 or A138 against MPXV and VACV (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig2) C, D, G).\n\n### Structural basis for the recognition of M1R by the antibodies\n\nTo gain insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the neutralization activity of M1R antibodies, we attempted a structural study on the M1R-A129/A138 Fab complexes. The crystal structures of the M1R-A129/A138 Fab complexes were determined at resolutions of 2.17 and 3.49 Å, respectively (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3), Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Tab1) and Fig. S [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). The binding approach of A138 Fab towards M1R was closely resembled that of previously reported mouse antibodies M12B9 (PDB: 4U6H)[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR34 \"Kaever, T. et al. Potent neutralization of vaccinia virus by divergent murine antibodies targeting a common site of vulnerability in L1 protein. J. Virol. 88, 11339–11355 (2014).\") and 7D11 (PDB: 2I9L)[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR26 \"Su, H. P., Golden, J. W., Gittis, A. G., Hooper, J. W. & Garboczi, D. N.

Upon superposition, only a minor clash was found between A138 and A129 Fab, which was consistent with their limited competitive binding characteristics (Fig. S [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Similar to the structure of VACV L1R, M1R within the M1R-Fab complex took the conformation of a bundle of α-helices packed against a pair of two-stranded β-sheets (Figs. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3) and S [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Notably, a slight structural variance between MPXV M1R and VACV L1R was observed in the β1 and β3 strands (Fig. S [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). In the M1R structure, these strands are discontinuous and segmented into two shorter β strands, which we named β1, β1’, β3, and β3’, respectively. By contrast, the corresponding region of VACV L1R displayed continuous β1 and β3 strands (Fig. S [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). While we observed this structural difference, we could not conclude that the slight difference between MPXV M1R and VACV L1R was a result of their inherent nature, crystal packing effects or antibody interactions.\n\n**Fig. 3: Complex structures of A138 Fab and A129 Fab bound to M1R.**\n\n[![figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig3_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/3)\n\n**A** Overall structure of antibodies in complex with M1R. MPXV M1R or VACV L1R is colored in cornflower blue; Fab of A138, M12B9, 7D11 and A129 is shown in green, brown, pink and golden, respectively. The heavy chain is shown in a darker color, and all the complex structures are positioned with M1R/L1R in the same orientation. **B** A129 mainly uses its heavy chain to bind the β-sheet of M1R. The buried surface area (BSA) between the A129 heavy chain and M1R is 431 Å2 while that of the light chain is 192 Å2. The β-sheet of M1R is shown in red and the loops connecting β-strands with helices are shown in green. The epitope of A129 on M1R is labeled by a golden line. **C** A138 mainly uses its heavy chain to bind to the loops connecting β-strands and helices of M1R.

The β-sheet of M1R is shown in red and the loops connecting β-strands with helices are shown in green. The epitope of A129 on M1R is labeled by a green line. **D** Sequence and secondary structures of M1R. Contacting residues in M1R for A129 and A138 are indicated by golden and green dots, respectively.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/3)\n\n**Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics (molecular replacement)**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/tables/1)\n\nA138 Fab utilized its three CDRs of the heavy chain and CDR3 of light chain to bind to the loop region connecting the α helices and β sheets of M1R (540 Å2 for the heavy chain and 258 Å2 for the light chain), which is located on the opposite side of the amino and carboxyl termini of M1R (Fig. [3C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3)). Within the loop region of M1R (A30-E37), interactions occurred with CDR3 residues (T91-F94, L96) of the A138 light chain, as well as with CDR1 (Y33), CDR2 (S52-S54, T56-T57), and CDR3 (Y105) residues of the heavy chain. Additional scattered interaction residues, including N55, K127, and I128 predominantly engaged with residues from CDR1 (R30, D31) and CDR2 (R53, S54, and T57) from the heavy chain of A138 (Figs. [3D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3), [4B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig4) and Table [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). These interactions included 14 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges (Fig. [4B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig4) and Table [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Notably, the sequence of the A138 heavy chain originates from human germline IGHV3-11, whereas both 7D11 and M12B9 stem from the mouse germline IGHV1S26, which is the closest match to human germline IGHV1-8\\*02. Additionally, all these antibodies, including A138, 7D11, and M12B9, displayed robust neutralizing activity against VACV. These findings suggested that although these antibodies are from diverse germlines, they could also bind to a shared epitope, reinforcing the notion that this epitope represents a conserved vulnerable site among Orthopoxviruses.\n\n**Fig. 4: The binding interface between M1R and A129/A138 Fab.**\n\n[![figure 4](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig4_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/4)\n\nDetailed interactions of the A129 Fab ( **A**) and A138 Fab ( **B**) with M1R. Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are indicated by dashed lines. M1R is shown in cornflower blue. The heavy and light chains of A129 are shown in dark goldenrod and yellow, respectively. The heavy and light chains of A138 are shown in spring green and green yellow, respectively.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/4)\n\nThe analysis of the complex structure of M1R-A129 Fab revealed that A129 mainly binds to the β sheets of M1R, specifically the parallel β1-β1’ and β3 strands, as well as the connecting loop between α4 and β3 (Figs. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3) B and [3D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3)). The heavy chain of A129 Fab comprises the majority of the recognition sites for M1R (Fig. [4A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig4) and Table [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). The interface between the heavy chain and M1R buries a total surface area of 431 Å2, whereas the area between the light chain and M1R spans only 192 Å2 (Fig. [3B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3)). The β1 and β1’ strands of M1R (residues N40-N46) interact with CDR2 (W52, N57, T58, and D59), CDR3 (N104-F108) of the A129 heavy chain, as well as CDR3 (A91 and N92) of the A129 light chain. In addition, several sporadic residues on or near the β3 strand also participate in interactions with the heavy chain CDR2 (E62 and D59) and light chain CDR3 (N92, S93, and F94) (Figs. [3D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig3) and [4A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig4)). These interactions include a total of 11 hydrogen bonds, with six involving the heavy chain and two involving the light chain (Fig. [4A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig4) and Table [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)).\n\n### Analysis of epitopes recognized by B026 and B019 antibodies targeting B6R\n\nWe first attempted to solve crystal structures in order to decipher the binding epitopes of neutralizing antibodies targeting B6R. Unfortunately, no crystals appeared for either the B6R-B019 or B6R-B026 Fab complexes. As an alternative, we employed biochemical studies to determine the potential epitopes of these antibodies on B6R. Employing AlphaFold2, we predicted the three-dimensional structure of B6R, revealing that its extracellular domain to consists of a flexible N-terminal region (residue 1-19), followed by four sushi domains (residues 20 to 239), followed by a stalk region (residues 240-279). The latter is composed of a connecting loop and a partial alpha helix juxtaposed to transmembrane domain (Fig. [5A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig5)). Based on the predicted domain, we designed a series of constructs with a 6×His-tag at the C-terminus (Fig. [5B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig5)). Utilizing the BLI assay, we assessed the binding affinity of these truncated B6R proteins for B026 and B019. The results indicated that B026 bound to the entire extracellular domain of B6R (residues 19-279; clone 1). By contrast, B026 failed to bind to truncated B6R variants containing only domains 1-4 (clone 2), indicating that the stalk region of B6R (residues 240-279) is indispensable for B026 binding. To validate this specific interaction, we subsequently generated constructs with or without the stalk region. B026 exhibited robust binding activity with the constructs containing the stalk region (clones 7, 9, 11 and 12), while showing no binding with fragments lacking this region (clones 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10). The results further confirmed the critical role of the stalk region in mediating B026-B6R interactions (Fig. [5C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig5)). In addition, strong binding reactivity was observed between B019 and all truncated B6R proteins containing domain 4 (clones 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11), whereas minimal or no binding occurred with constructs lacking this domain (clones 3, 4, 5 and 12), which suggests the specific recognition of domain 4 by B019 (Fig. [5D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig5)).\n\n**Fig. 5: Epitopes analysis of B026 and B019.**\n\n[![figure 5](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig5_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/5)\n\n**A** Modeled structure of the B6R protein predicted using AlphaFold2.

Intranasal administration of VACV resulted in significant weight loss and mortality in C57BL/6 mice. Subsequently, mice were administered either B026, A138, or a combination of both either one day before (prophylactic group) or one day after (therapeutic group) VACV challenge (Figs. [6A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6) and S [7A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). Over the course of 15 days, the animals were closely monitored for changes of body weight and survival.\n\n**Fig. 6: Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of B026 and A138 in a high-dose VACV-challenge mouse model.**\n\n[![figure 6](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig6_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/6)\n\n**A** Schematic diagram of the prophylactic and therapeutic models. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups ( _n_ = 6 per group). For the prophylactic model, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with PBS, individual antibodies (A138 or B026) or antibody cocktail (A138 and B026) at 24 hrs before challenged with a high-dose (109 PFU) of VACV. For the therapeutic model, mice were injected i.p. 24 hrs after challenge with 109 PFU VACV. Body weight ( **B**, **D**) and survival curves ( **C**, **E**) were recorded. **B**, **C** show data for prophylactic model while ( **D**) and ( **E**) for the therapeutic model. **F**, **G** Viral titers in the lungs and spleen of mice in the prophylactic ( **F**) and therapeutic groups ( **G**). The data represent means ± SEM, indicated by error bars. The significance of differences between groups was assessed using one-way ANOVAs followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for multiple comparisons. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/6)\n\nIn the prophylactic group, we initially conducted experiments using a dose of 107 plaque-forming units (PFU). The results demonstrated that either a single dose of B026 or the combination of B026 and A138 conferred complete protection (Fig. S [7B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM1)). To further evaluate the protective efficacy of the antibodies, we increased the challenge dose to 109 PFU. Under this heightened challenge scenario, control mice administrated PBS experienced severe illness, with all animals succumbing by day 10 post-inoculation (p.i.), while a single dose of either B026 or A138 only conferred partial protection (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6) B, C). Specifically, all mice in the A138 and B026 treated groups experienced significant weight loss, with 83% and 66% survival rates, respectively. By contrast, mice pre-treated with the combination of B026 and A138 displayed only slight weight loss during the initial 10 days after viral challenge, followed by subsequent body weight recovery. Meanwhile, those in the control group continued to lose weight without any signs of improvement (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6) B, C). The viral load in the lungs and spleen was assessed via the PRNT assay at four days post-infection (dpi). In the combination treatment group, infectious viral levels were extremely low or undetectable in both the lungs and spleen, even after challenge with 109 PFU (Fig. [6F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6)).\n\nMice mock-treated with PBS in the treatment group showed similar outcomes to those in the prophylactic group, with all succumbing by day 10 p.i. (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6) D, [E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6)). Treatment with either B026 or A138 alone resulted in considerable reductions of body weight, with survival rates of approximately 66% and 50% in the A138 and B026 treated groups, respectively (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6) D, [E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6)). The levels of infectious virions in the lungs and spleen of these two groups ranged from 102 to 103 PFU/g, which was lower than in the control group (Fig. [6G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6)). By contrast, animals treated with the combination of B026 and A138 maintained relatively stable body weights and were fully protected from VACV infection (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6) D, E). No virions were detected in the two organs of mice treated with the combination of B026 and A138, whereas the PBS mock-treated mice exhibited viral levels ranging from 104 to 105 PFU/g (Fig. [6G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig6)). Collectively, these results underscored the superior protective efficacy of the combination of B026 and A138 against authentic VACV infection in vivo, using either prophylactic or therapeutic interventions.\n\nTo further investigate the protective and therapeutic efficacy of the identified antibodies in a mouse model of MPXV infection, we conducted animal studies using live clade IIb MPXV (MPXV-B.1-China-C-Tan-CQ01)[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR35 \"Huang, B. et al. Isolation and characterization of monkeypox virus from the first case of monkeypox - chongqing municipality, China, 2022. China CDC Wkly. 4, 1019–1024 (2022).\") in BALB/c mice[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR36 \"Tang, D. et al. Recombinant proteins A29L, M1R, A35R, and B6R vaccination protects mice from mpox virus challenge. Front. Immunol. 14, 1203410 (2023).\"). Since the MPXV strain we used does not cause lethality in BALB/c mice, here we measured viral loads in various organs to assess antibody efficacy through qPCR analysis. The results revealed that viral loads were highest in the lungs (3.17 × 105 copies/mL, PBS group), while being lower in the liver and spleen (Fig. [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig7) A, B). In both prophylactic and therapeutic groups, antibody-treated mice exhibited reduced viral loads in the lungs, liver, and spleen compared to the control group (PBS group) (Fig. [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#Fig7) A, B). This demonstrating that the antibodies used in our study effectively provided protection against MPXV infection. Notably, co-administration of the A138 and B026 antibodies resulted in significantly lower viral titers in all organs, suggesting that the combination of two antibodies targeting different antigens enhanced protective efficacy. However, the bispecific antibody ScFvA138B026 containing both A138 and B026 binding regions exhibited a similar, or slightly reduced, protective effect compared to A138 or B026 alone.\n\n**Fig. 7: Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of B026 and A138 in a MPXV-challenged mouse model.**\n\n[![figure 7](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-58180-z/MediaObjects/41467_2025_58180_Fig7_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z/figures/7)\n\n**A** Viral titers in the lungs, liver and spleen of mice in the prophylactic model. **B** Viral titers in the lungs, liver and spleen of mice in the therapeutic model.

Detailed neutralizing assays indicated that optimal protection could be achieved by combining two highly potent neutralizing antibodies, each targeting a different antigen—M1R on the surface of MV and B6R on the surface of EV. Protection was effective when using a combination of B026 and A138, which agreed with findings in other Orthopoxviruses. In addition, we characterized the specific binding epitopes of these four antibodies targeting M1R and B6R via crystallographic studies and biochemical analysis. Our findings provide valuable insights and potential guidance for future MPXV therapy, highlighting the efficacy of employing two potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting M1R or B6R.\n\nIn this study, we utilized a fully human antibody library, comprising samples derived from PBMC of over 2000 healthy donors aged between 20 and 60 years old for antibody screening. Notably, mandatory vaccination with the vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (VACV-VTT) for the general population ceased in 1980. Therefore, donors aged over 45 might have received historical vaccination with the VACV-VTT, leading to cross-reactivity against MPXV surface proteins, which may have provided neutralizing protection against VACV-VTT even after more than 40 years[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR37 \"Xia, A. et al. Cross-reactive antibody response to Monkeypox virus surface proteins in a small proportion of individuals with and without Chinese smallpox vaccination history. BMC Biol. 21, 205 (2023).\"). Additionally, individuals born after 1980 may also exhibit a serum antibody response against MPXV surface proteins due to their exposure to some self-limiting Orthopoxviruses, as previously observed by Xia et al.[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR37 \"Xia, A. et al. Cross-reactive antibody response to Monkeypox virus surface proteins in a small proportion of individuals with and without Chinese smallpox vaccination history. BMC Biol. 21, 205 (2023).\"). Thus, the human antibody library utilized in our study potentially contains a diverse array of potent and distinct neutralizing antibodies against MPXV antigens, confirming the success of neutralizing antibody screening.\n\nThe correlation between epitopes and the neutralizing capacities of M1R and B6R antibodies offers valuable insights for the identification of vulnerable and functional sites. Among M1R antibodies, our structural studies delineated two distinct functional epitopes on M1R. One epitope, targeted by A138 and 7D11, is situated away from the C-terminal region, connecting the transmembrane domain on the surface of MV. This epitope is theoretically the most vulnerable, as it remains accessible regardless of the rotation of M1R around its stalk. By contrast, the epitope targeted by A129 is located at the side of M1R, which becomes less accessible when M1R rotates towards this region. The buried surface area and neutralizing activity of A129 was significantly lower than that of A138, likely due to reduced accessibility. As for B6R antibodies, four distinct binding epitopes are roughly clustered based on competitive BLI assays. After further neutralization experiments and biochemical analyzes, we found that two highly potent neutralizing antibodies (B026 and B019) target domain 4 or close to the stalk region. This was consistent with a previous study on B5R, with neutralizing antibodies binding around domain 4 or the stalk region[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR38 \"Aldaz-Carroll, L. et al. Epitope-mapping studies define two major neutralization sites on the vaccinia virus extracellular enveloped virus glycoprotein B5R. J. Virol. 79, 6260–6271 (2005).\"). The binding of these antibodies to B6R likely modulates its flexibility on the virion surface, affecting its interaction with binding partners. In this study, antibodies sharing a similar epitope with B019 often exhibited low neutralization activity, indicating that this epitope might represent a weak neutralization target.\n\nM1R, a myristoylated antigen located on the surface of the MV form of MPXV, was predicted to be a crucial component of the entry fusion complex (EFC). Its homolog, L1R, has been reported to play roles in morphogenesis, the formation of infectious virions, and virus entry[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR39 \"Ravanello, M. P. & Hruby, D. E. Conditional lethal expression of the vaccinia virus L1R myristylated protein reveals a role in virion assembly. J. Virol. 68, 6401–6410 (1994).\"), [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR40 \"Hooper, J. W., Custer, D. M., Schmaljohn, C. S. & Schmaljohn, A. L. DNA vaccination with vaccinia virus L1R and A33R genes protects mice against a lethal poxvirus challenge. Virology 266, 329–339 (2000).\"). Additionally, the discontinuous loops 1, 2, and 3, targeted by A138 and several other highly potent neutralizing antibodies, have been identified as interaction domains for non-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) receptors[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR41 \"Foo, C. H. et al. Vaccinia virus L1 binds to cell surfaces and blocks virus entry independently of glycosaminoglycans. Virology 385, 368–382 (2009).\"). As a result, antibodies such as A138 are predicted to exert their neutralizing effects by hindering the binding of M1R to non-GAG molecule(s) receptor, potentially impeding virus entry[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR41 \"Foo, C. H. et al. Vaccinia virus L1 binds to cell surfaces and blocks virus entry independently of glycosaminoglycans. Virology 385, 368–382 (2009).\"), [42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR42 \"Bisht, H., Weisberg, A. S. & Moss, B. Vaccinia virus l1 protein is required for cell entry and membrane fusion. J. Virol. 82, 8687–8694 (2008).\"). As a surface protein on EV, B6R is known to be associated with the regulation of complement activation[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR42 \"Bisht, H., Weisberg, A. S. & Moss, B. Vaccinia virus l1 protein is required for cell entry and membrane fusion. J. Virol. 82, 8687–8694 (2008).\"). The neutralization mechanisms of B6R antibodies are complex, involving the recruitment of complement C1q, the covalent attachment of C3 to the virion surface hindering binding to target cells, as well as the induction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR43 \"Benhnia, M. R. et al. Heavily isotype-dependent protective activities of human antibodies against vaccinia virus extracellular virion antigen B5. J. Virol. 83, 12355–12367 (2009).\"). Although we established the potent protective effects and detailed epitopes of M1R and B6R antibodies, a clear explanation of their neutralization mechanisms remain elusive. Future studies on the function of Orthopoxvirus proteins might provide a better understanding of the underlying processes.\n\nThere are two limitations in our studies. First, in the neutralization assay, we assessed the in vitro neutralizing activity of combined antibodies using a mixture of MV and EV forms of MPXV/VACV. However, the EV forms are fragile and easily converted into MV. To evaluating the protection effect of antibodies targeting the EV form, excess MV antibody 7D11 was added to deplete the residual MV[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR38 \"Aldaz-Carroll, L. et al. Epitope-mapping studies define two major neutralization sites on the vaccinia virus extracellular enveloped virus glycoprotein B5R. J. Virol. 79, 6260–6271 (2005).\"). However, we didn’t involve 7D11 into the MV + EV neutralization assay, as 7D11 would interfere the neutralization effect of anti-M1R antibodies. Although we tried to mix the MV and EV form in equal molar ratio, there are actually more MV forms in the mixture. This higher MV/EV ratio may affect the accuracy of antibody neutralizing activity assessment, although it does not alter the final conclusion.\n\nThe second limitation we need to point out is that we used a BALB/c mice model infected with MPXV (MPXV-B.1-China-C-Tan-CQ01)[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR35 \"Huang, B. et al. Isolation and characterization of monkeypox virus from the first case of monkeypox - chongqing municipality, China, 2022. China CDC Wkly. 4, 1019–1024 (2022).\"), which belongs to lineage B.1, clade IIb. We chose this model based on a previous study using WIBP-MPXV-001, also from lineage B.1, clade IIb[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR36 \"Tang, D. et al. Recombinant proteins A29L, M1R, A35R, and B6R vaccination protects mice from mpox virus challenge. Front. Immunol. 14, 1203410 (2023).\"), [44](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR44 \"Zeng, Y. et al. The assessment on cross immunity with smallpox virus and antiviral drug sensitivity of the isolated mpox virus strain WIBP-MPXV-001 in China. Emerg. Microbes Infect. 12, 2208682 (2023).\"). In WIBP-MPXV-001 infected BALB/c model, moderate viral loads and significant histopathological changes were observed in the lungs, with minimal effects on the body weight and overall health. This model has been successfully employed to evaluate the immunoprotective efficacy of a monkeypox vaccine. In our current model, viral DNA was detected in lung, liver and spleen, with lungs as the major site. The viral load in the lungs of PBS group was 3.17 × 105 copies/mL. The mice exhibited only mild weight loss and slight lethargy, without severe disease phenotypes such as hunched posture, significant weight loss, or mortality. While this model is not perfect, it is the only MPXV model we could access at the moment. Based on this model, we used qPCR to assess viral loads of different groups, including A138, B026, A138 + B026, ScFvA138B026. Generally speaking, the combined A138 and B026 displayed the most potent protection in both preventive and therapeutic groups. Surprisingly, ScFvA138B026 exhibited suboptimal protective and therapeutic effects compared to the single antibodies, possibly due to variations in its distribution, metabolism, and clearance in vivo. We also included the control antibody 7D11, targeting L1R protein of VACV, which has shown strong neutralizing activity[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR29 \"Esqueda A. et al. A monoclonal antibody produced in glycoengineered plants potently neutralizes monkeypox virus. Vaccines (Basel) 11, 1179 (2023).\"). The protective and therapeutic effects of 7D11 were found to be comparable to, or even slightly better than, those of the combined A138 and B026. This suggests that the combination of antibodies may not be necessary for in vivo protection against MPXV and could potentially be substituted with a single potent anti-MV antibody, such as 7D11. This observation is consistent with findings in other literature[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR22 \"Ren, Z. et al. Identification of mpox M1R and B6R monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that efficiently neutralize authentic mpox virus. Emerg. Microbes Infect. 13, 2401931 (2024).\"). However, we could not exclude the possibility that observed discrepancies might arise from the specific mice model and experiment system we used. Our examination of viral load via qPCR cannot distinguish infectious virions from residual virus. Future studies should incorporate plaque assays and more focus on developing robust mice models to accurately assess the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nThe research is performed under the study protocol AMMS-11-2023-015.

VACV and replication-deficient MPXV were manipulated under BSL-2 conditions. MPXV were manipulated under BSL-3 conditions.\n\n### Viruses preparations for neutralization assay\n\nMV and EV were prepared as previously described[45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR45 \"Benhnia, M.

For EV stock preparation, Vero or VERO E6 G9R + A1L Cell were infected at a multiplicity of 0.5 PFU/cell. When cytopathic effect was complete (4 days for replication-deficient MPXV and 48 h for VACV) the culture supernatant was harvested and cleared by centrifugation (30 min at 2000 × _g_), stored at 4 °C, and used within 2 weeks of preparation. The titers of the stock were determined in the presence of an MV-neutralizing anti-L1R MAb (7D11) to neutralize any contaminating MV or damaged EV[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR38 \"Aldaz-Carroll, L. et al.

Cells were harvested at 5 days (for replication-deficient MPXV) or 48 h (for VACV). Virus was isolated by rapidly freeze-thawing the cell pellet three times in DMEM supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated FCS. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 700 × _g_ for 8 minutes. The virus was sonicated for 40 seconds, then layered over 36% sucrose. The virus was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm (33,000 × _g_) for 80 minutes at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 1% heat-inactivated FCS. The virus solution was aliquoted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (50 µL per aliquot) and stored at −80 °C for long-term preservation.\n\nFor the preparation of the mixtures of MV and EV forms of VACV and replication-deficient MPXV, we diluted the EV and MV viruses with serum-free DMEM medium to 400 pfu/100 µL. Then, the two diluted viruses were mixed in equal volumes to obtain mixtures of MV and EV. The residual MV fraction in the EV stocks resulting in a higher proportion of MV in the mixture. The mixture was freshly prepared each time it was used.\n\n### Viruses preparations for in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic study\n\nFor VACV preparation[47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR47 \"Reynoso, G. V., Shannon, J. P., Americo, J. L., Gibbs, J. & Hickman, H. D. Growth and purification of vaccinia virus stocks for MPM imaging. Methods Mol. Biol.

Incubate the infected cells at 37 °C for 2 h to allow for virus attachment and entry. After this period, replace the medium with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS to support cell growth. Continue incubation at 37 °C for 48–72 huntil a complete cytopathic effect (CPE) is observed. To harvest the VACV, freeze-thaw the infected cell cultures three times at -80 °C. After the final thaw, briefly centrifuge the samples at 4 °C to pellet the cells, and discard the cell debris. Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 µm filter to remove any remaining cellular debris. Transfer the filtered virus solution to ultracentrifuge tubes containing a 36% sucrose cushion, and balance the tubes before centrifuging. Centrifuge at 32,900 × _g_ for 80 minutes at 4 °C. After centrifugation, carefully discard the supernatant and resuspend the viral pellet in an appropriate volume of PBS.

Vero cells were infected with MPXV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU/cell and incubated at 37 °C for 4–5 days, until a complete cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. To harvest the virus, infected cells were subjected to the freeze-thaw cycles at -80 °C.

The virus solution was aliquoted into clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes (50 µL per aliquot) and stored at -80 °C for long-term preservation.\n\n### Protein expression and purification\n\nThe recombinant MPXV proteins M1R and B6R used for screening were produced using Expi293F system whereas those used for crystallization were expressed in insect cell system. The proteins produced in insect cell system harbored a less potential glycosylation, which was in favor for crystallization.\n\nFor screening, the extracellular domain of M1R (residue 1-181) and B6R (residue 20-279) were constructed on the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS with IL-2 signal peptide and a C-terminal 6×His Tag. The expression vectors were transiently transfected into 293F cells (ATCC, CBP60437) by polyethylenimine (PEI) (Kairuibiotech, K20001). Protein was purified from filtered cell supernatants using Ni-NTA resin (Solarbio, P2010) before undergoing additional purification by size-exclusion chromatography in 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0.\n\nFor crystallization, the extracellular domain of M1R (residue 1-181) was cloned into the pFastBac dual vector with a gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal 6×His tag for purification. The construct was transformed into DH10Bac component cells, and the extracted bacmid was then transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin II Reagent (Invitrogen). The low-titered viruses were harvested and then amplified to generate a high-titer virus stock, which was used to infect Hi5 cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/mL. The supernatant of cell culture containing the secreted M1R was harvested 60 h after infection, concentrated and buffer-exchanged to HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). M1R was captured by Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 300 mM imidazole in HBS buffer. M1R was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using the Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with HBS buffer. Fractions containing M1R were collected and frozen at -80 °C.\n\n### Screening of M1R and B6R antibodies\n\nCandidate antibodies were screened from a phage-display fully human antibody library (simplified as ST-ST-HuNAL, constructed by Sanyou Bio with the capacity of 2.2 × 1011, Fab format) ( [https://www.sanyoubio.com.cn](https://www.sanyoubio.com.cn/)) by solid-phase immunotube screening method against recombinant M1R and B6R proteins of MPXV as targets. Briefly, M1R or B6R protein in carbonate buffer was coated on Nunc™ Immuno MaxiSorbTubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 472230), overnight at 4 °C. The next day, washing with PBS 3 times, then blocking buffer, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to the tube and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Washing with PBS 3 times, added the phage library solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) 20 times to remove the non-specific phage. Bound phages were eluted by 30 min of digestion using 500 μL of 0.25 mg/mL trypsin at room temperature with rotation. The reaction was stopped with 10 μL 10% AEBSF. The eluted phages were used to infect E. coli XL1-blue for titer determination. The amount of input phage of the next rounds was 1 × 1012 PFU, and the washing time was 20 times. The output phage titer of every round of panning was measured.\n\n### Phage ELISA\n\nOver 500 phage clones were randomly selected during the final round of panning, and their antigen-binding ability was analyzed by ELISA. A 96-well plate was coated with 100 μL of 1 μg/mL antigen at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the plate was washed 3 times with PBS buffer and blocked with 3% BSA buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Washing with PBST 5 times, 25 μL of supernatant containing soluble fragment in 75 μL of PBS supplemented with 3% (w/v) BSA was added to each well of the ELISA plate, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. The wells were washed with 5 times with PBST, and 100 μL of 1:10,000 anti-M13-HRP (SinoBiological, 11973, Monoclonal Mouse IgG1 Clone #MM05) antibody in PBS supplemented with 3% (w/v) BSA was added to each well. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation. The wells were washed 5 times with PBST and 1 time with PBS, and 100 μL of TMB (Invitrogen™, 002023) solution was added to each well. The reaction was stopped with 50 μL of ELISA terminating solution (New Cell&Molecular Biotech, E40500), and the absorbance was read at 450/620 nm using an ELISA plate reader.\n\n### Construction, Expression, and Purification of M1R and B6R antibodies\n\nThe antibody was prepared using Expi293F system. Briefly, after phagemid extraction, the heavy-chain and light-chain was amplified via PCR. The heavy-chain and light-chain gene were cloned into antibody expression vectors encoding the constant regions of human IgG1 by enzymatic assembly[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR48 \"Gibson, D. G. et al. Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases. Nat. Methods 6, 343–345 (2009).\"). The construct was transferred into 293F cells. Plasmids containing the heavy-chain and light-chain of the antibody were mixed with PEI and added to the prepared cell suspension with gentle shaking. The cell culture was then transferred and incubated at 37 °C in the shaker with 7% CO2. Five days after transfection, the culture supernatant containing antibody was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × _g_ for 10 min and the resulting supernatant was subjected to affinity purification with protein G (Solarbio, R8300). Antibody was eluted with 100 mM Glycine-HCl (pH 3.0) and then neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl. The purity of the eluted proteins was assessed by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Finally, the purified antibody was exchanged into PBS buffer using a centrifugal filterunit (Millipore, UFC8010). Aliquots were made and stored in −80 °C. The IGBLAST program ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/igblast.cgi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/igblast.cgi)) was used to analyze germline genes, germline divergence, the framework region (FR) and the loop length of CDR3 for each antibody clone.\n\n### ELISA\n\nELISA was used to measure the EC50 of antibodies. Each antigen (M1R and B6R) was diluted to 1 μg/mL with coating buffer followed by coating the 96-well plates with each antigen, respectively, at 4 °C overnight. The antibodies were serially diluted by 3-fold and placed into the plate coated with 3% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBST, the plate was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-2453) at 37 °C for 1 h and color reaction was developed by adding 100 μL TMB for 5 min followed by adding 50 μL of ELISA terminating solution to stop the reaction. The absorbance was measured at 450/620 nm using an ELISA plate reader.\n\n### Biolayer interferometry (BLI) analysis\n\nExperiments were performed on an Octet RED biosensor instrument (Pall ForteBio; Menlo Park) essentially. FortéBio data analysis software, version 12.1.was used to analysis data from Biolayer interferometry (BLI). Briefly, biosensors were pre-wetted in running buffer containing DPBS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween-20. M1R or B6R linked with His-tag were loaded onto Ni-NTA biosensor tips (ForteBio, 18-5101) at a concentration of 5 ug/mL. Biosensors were then incubated with fold dilutions of antibodies. For affinity testing of bsAbs, we used a 1:1 fitting model for curve fitting, as it provided a better fit than the bivalent analyte model. However, the 1:1 model may not fully reflect true monovalent interactions, as binding kinetics could be influenced by multivalent interactions or non-specific binding.\n\nFor cross-competition assay, antibody-antigen complexes were tested for the ability to bind a second antibody in sandwich assay. Briefly, biosensors were pre-wetted in running buffer containing DPBS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween-20. M1R or B6R linked with His-tag were loaded onto Ni-NTA biosensor tips at a concentration of 5 ug/mL. Biosensors were then incubated with primary antibodies at a concentration of 300 nM. Following this, secondary antibodies were loaded at a concentration of 150 nM. The extent of antibody-antigen association was determined as the wavelength shift in nm and calculated as a percentage after normalization. In this calculation, 0%-20% was considered complete competition, 20%-60% was considered partial competition, and over 60% was considered non-competition. Experiments were performed in duplicate.\n\n### Virus neutralization assays\n\nThe neutralizing activity of antibodies was determined using MV or EV forms of VACV, or MPXV defective virus in a PRNT assay. Neutralization of VACV EV was performed using 10% guinea pig complement (Solarbio, S4990), and neutralization of VACV MV was performed without complement. For EV neutralization, MV was depleted with blocking mAbs MV-neutralizing anti-L1R MAb (7D11) at 20 μg/mL. The antibodies were serial dilutions (3 or 5-fold) with serum-free DMEM medium with or without complement, and then mixed with an equal volume of virus (200 pfu/100 uL) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was added to the 6-well cell plates laid with Vero cells or Vero E6 G9R + A1L cells one day prior (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated for 2 h before replacing media with DMEM containing 2% FBS (v/v) and 0.3% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sinopharm, LA1810501). After incubation for 48 h, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, stained with crystal violet solution for 0.5 h, and rinsed with distilled water[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR23 \"Gilchuk, I. et al. Cross-neutralizing and protective human antibody specificities to poxvirus infections. Cell 167, 684–694.e689 (2016).\"). For the EV + MV neutralization assay, 7D11 was not used as it would affect anti-M1R antibodies, while complement was included to assist the efficacy of anti-B6R antibodies.\n\n### In vivo prophylactic and therapeutic study\n\nTo evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of antibodies, six- to eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (purchased from Charles river, 213) were randomly assigned to four groups. Mice in the A138 and B026 groups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg of antibody. The A138 + B026 group received a 1:1 combination of the two antibodies, with a total dose of 20 mg/kg. The control group received an equivalent volume of 400 µL PBS. For viral challenge, mice were intranasally inoculated with either 107 PFU or 109 PFU of VACV-VTT. Mice were monitored daily for signs of morbidity, and euthanasia was performed according to IACUC guidelines when weight loss exceeded 30% of the initial body weight. Virus titers were quantified by homogenizing the lungs and spleens of individual mice, followed by viral plating on confluent Vero cell monolayers.\n\nTo further evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of antibodies, we conducted a study using a mouse model infected with live MPXV[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR36 \"Tang, D. et al. Recombinant proteins A29L, M1R, A35R, and B6R vaccination protects mice from mpox virus challenge. Front. Immunol. 14, 1203410 (2023).\"). Three- to four-week-old male BALB/c mice (purchased from Charles river, 211) were randomly assigned to six groups: 7D11, A138, B026, A138 + B026, ScFvA138B026, and PBS. Mice in the 7D11, A138, and B026 groups received a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg of antibody. The A138 + B026 group received a 1:1 combination of both antibodies at a total dose of 20 mg/kg. The bivalent antibody group received a total dose of 26.34 mg/kg, adjusted to match the molar concentration of the other antibody groups. The control group was injected with 400 µL of PBS. Mice were intranasally inoculated with 106 PFU of MPXV. Daily monitoring for signs of morbidity was performed, and euthanasia was carried out in accordance with IACUC guidelines for mice that experienced a weight loss exceeding 30% of their initial body weight. Mice were euthanized four days after challenged with MPXV, and their organs were collected for analysis. Virus titers were assessed by homogenizing the lungs, liver, and spleens of individual mice, followed by quantification of viral copies.\n\n### Crystallization and data collection\n\nThe M1R (residue 1-181) expressed in insect cell and the Fab fragment of A138 or A129 were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1.2, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and further purified by gel-filtration chromatography. The purified complex concentrated to ~10 mg/mL in HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl) was used for crystallization. The screening trials were performed at 18 °C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method by mixing 0.15 μL protein with 0.15 μL reservoir solution. Crystals were successfully obtained in 0.2 M Lithium citrate tribasic tetrahydrate, 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350 for M1R-A129 complex and 0.1 M Magnesium formate dihydrate, 15% w/v Polyethylene glycol 3,350 for M1R-A138 complex, respectively. Both diffraction data of M1R-A129 Fab and M1R-A138 Fab complex were collected at 100 K and at a wavelength of 0.97918 Å on the BL18U1 beam line of the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility.\n\n### Structure determination and refinement\n\nThe complex structure of M1R-A129 Fab and M1R-A138 Fab were determined by the molecular replacement method with PHASER (CCP4 Interface 7.1.007)[49](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#ref-CR49 \"McCoy, A. J. et al. Phaser crystallographic software. J. Appl Crystallogr 40, 658–674 (2007).\"). The search models were the structure vaccinia L1 (PDB:4U6H) and the structures of the variable domain of the heavy and light chains available in the PDB with the highest sequence identities. Subsequent model building and refinement were performed using COOT v.0.9.2 and PHENIX v.1.18.2, respectively. Final Ramachandran statistics: 97.32% favored, 2.68% allowed and 0.00% outliers for the final M1R-A129 Fab complex; 96.14% favored, 3.77% allowed and 0.09% outliers for the final M1R-A138 Fab complex.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyzes were conducted using Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). EC50 values were determined after log transformation of antibody concentration using sigmoidal dose-response nonlinear fit analysis, and IC50 values were determined using dose-response inhibition nonlinear fit model as described previously. Differences among animal groups were evaluated using One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for multiple comparisons. A significance level of _p_ < 0.05 was adopted for all statistical tests. The bars within the graphs represent mean values, and the error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM).\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the [Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58180-z#MOESM3) linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe crystal structure data generated in this study have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code [8ZU9](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/8ZU9) for A129/M1R, and accession code [8ZUA](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/8ZUA) for A138/M1R.

Although the PHEIC was lifted in 2023 due to declining global cases, a resurgence caused by clade Ib has reinstated the emergency status. Current mpox vaccines, based on live-attenuated or modified vaccinia virus (VACV), have historical use in smallpox prevention. Understanding the humoral immune response triggered by mpox vaccination and infection, as well as identifying correlates of protection, remain however critical.\n\n**Methods:** In a previous study, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody response of 1,000 individuals, half born before the cessation of smallpox vaccination in Italy (pre-1975) and half after (post-1979). Higher neutralizing antibody titers against MPXV and VACV were observed in subjects vaccinated against smallpox, indicating a cross-reactive immunity to MPXV. This study further investigated these findings by analyzing the IgG response to five MPXV and five VACV antigens in a subset of the previously tested cohort, using a multiplex immunoassay. Serum samples from 370 individuals were grouped by neutralization profile (negative for both MPXV and VACV, positive for both viruses, negative for MPXV but positive for VACV, and vice versa) and age (born before 1975 and after 1979).\n\n**Results:** Our data revealed stronger immune responses to specific antigens, particularly A35R/A33R and B6R/B5R, with MPXV-specific binding antibodies showing greater cross-reactivity compared to VACV ones. Furthermore, individuals born before 1975, vaccinated against smallpox, exhibited stronger binding and neutralizing antibody responses, as opposed to people born after 1979 in whom neutralization titers were lower. This suggests that prior VACV-vaccination and subsequent boosting from potential other OPXV encounters in the older population may have resulted in a more VACV-specific immune response over time.\n\n**Discussion:** This study provides insights into the antigenic determinants of MPXV and VACV antibody cross-reactivity and highlights differences in immune profiles across age and exposure groups. Results obtained suggest that VACV-vaccine imprinting shapes immunity, which could guide the development of more effective vaccine strategies for preventing mpox.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMonkeypox disease (mpox) is a zoonotic viral illness which is endemic in Central and Western Africa. In 2022, the geographic expansion of clade IIb Monkeypox virus (MPXV) outside the African continent has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) ( [1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B1)). The PHEIC was lifted in 2023 as global cases dropped substantially. However, the emergency status has been recently re-instated due to the multi-country outbreak caused by another MPXV strain, clade Ib ( [2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B2)). According to WHO, from January 2022 to 30 November 2024, 117,663 confirmed cases of mpox have been reported in 127 countries worldwide ( [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B3)).\n\nVaccination of high-risk groups is the best strategy to prevent mpox and reduce the severity of disease symptoms. Currently licensed vaccines for prevention of mpox are based on live-attenuated or modified vaccinia virus (VACV) and have been used in the past to fight smallpox. Evidence from surveillance programs conducted in the early 1980s suggest that prior VACV vaccination could be up to 85% effective against mpox ( [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B4)).\n\nThe ability of antibodies raised against VACV to provide cross-protection against MPXV lies in the fact that the viral core region of these two double-stranded DNA Orthopoxviruses (OPXV) exhibit over 95% sequence homology ( [5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B5)). Given the high conservation of OPXV genome, antibody cross-reactivity has been observed even towards other members of the genus such as Cowpox virus (CPXV) ( [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B6)).\n\nHerd immunity to MPXV and other OPXVs has however waned over time, as routine VACV immunization was discontinued in the late 1980s due to the eradication of smallpox disease ( [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B4)). As a consequence, the fraction of OPXV-naïve subjects in the population has increased over time.\n\nUnderstanding the humoral immunity triggered by MPXV infection and VACV vaccination is pivotal to pinpoint antigens that may act as candidates for new vaccines as well as to identify a correlate of protection, which is still missing.\n\nMPXV exists in two antigenically distinct infectious forms: the intracellular mature virion (IMV) and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). The surface membranes of these viral forms are characterized by approximately 25 proteins on the IMV and 6 surface proteins on the EEV ( [7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B7), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B8)), many of which play crucial roles in viral entry and transmission.\n\nDuring inter-host transmission, the IMV form predominates, expressing about 25 membrane-associated proteins, including MPXV A29L and E8L proteins. In contrast, the EEV form is primarily involved in intra-host transmission and carries six envelope proteins, including MPXV A35R and M1R proteins ( [9](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B9)– [11](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B11)). Six MPXV surface proteins were previously reported to induce antibodies with neutralization capacity and hence with potential as vaccine antigens ( [12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B12), [13](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B13)): H3L, E8L, M1R, A29L, A35R and B6R. The VACV orthologs of these viral antigens are, respectively, H3L, D8L, L1R, A27L, A33R and B5R ( [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B6), [12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B12), [13](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B13)).\n\nAmong these, MPXV A29L, the ortholog of VACV A27L, plays an essential role in viral replication and entry by binding to heparan sulphate ( [14](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B14)– [17](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B17)), while E8L, ortholog of D8L, mediates cell adhesion through binding with chondroitin sulphate ( [18](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B18), [19](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B19)). MPXV M1R/VACV L1R contributes to IMV assembly and entry ( [20](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B20), [21](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B21)).\n\nA35R, ortholog of VACV A33R, is an envelope glycoprotein of EEV, that facilitates the effective cell-to-cell spread of viral particles ( [22](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B22), [23](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B23)), while MPXV B6R/VACV B5R supports viral dissemination and regulates the complement system of the host cell ( [21](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B21)). B5R was also found to contribute to the formation of EEV during the wrapping steps of IMV ( [24](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B24), [25](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B25)).\n\nIn a previous study, we investigated the neutralizing antibody response towards MPXV and VACV in a population of 1,000 subjects, half born before the discontinuation of smallpox vaccination, and half after ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)). An association between VACV and MPXV antibody levels was observed, corroborating the evidence that VACV-based smallpox vaccines may also confer some degree of cross-protection that can neutralize MPXV infection. However, we observed that this cross-reactivity may not be completely bi-directional.\n\nInterestingly, a small percentage (15.6%) of individuals born after the interruption of anti-smallpox immunization showed positive VACV and/or MPXV neutralization titres ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)), suggesting that exposure to similar OPXVs over time may have influenced the observed data.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate the binding antibody response directed towards 5 MPXV antigens (E8L, M1R, A29L, A35R and B6R) and their VACV orthologs (D8L, L1R, A27, A33R and B5R) in a subset of the above-mentioned cohort, via a multiplex immunoassay (MSD).\n\nCorrelations between the IgG levels against the 10 antigens and the neutralization titres may help elucidating the antigenic determinants responsible for the cross-reactivity observed in the previously obtained neutralization data. Additionally, although recent research has shown that it is unlikely to distinguish VACV-immunized and MPXV infected individuals using these 10 antigens ( [27](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B27), [28](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B28)), the MSD data can help understand if there is a trend for increased binding to certain antigens based on the exposure group.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Serum samples\n\nA total of 370 human serum samples were selected from a previous sero-epidemiological study ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)). In this previous study, the neutralizing antibody response towards MPXV and VACV was investigated in a population of 1,000 subjects, half born before the discontinuation of smallpox vaccination ( [29](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B29)), and half after. These samples were anonymously collected in 2022 in the Apulia region (Southern Italy) as residual samples for unknown diagnostic purposes. For each sample, only the date of collection and the subject’s age and sex were recorded. All serum samples were tested by the established microneutralization cytopathic effect-based assay (hereafter referred to as Virus Neutralization, VN) against MPXV and VACV as previously reported ( [30](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B30)).\n\nFor this study, the selected 370 serum samples were grouped in 4 exposure groups based on their neutralization profile, i.e., negative for both MPXV and VACV neutralizing antibodies (MPXV- VACV-, hereafter referred to as V-M-), positive for both VACV and MPXV neutralization antibodies (MPXV+ VACV+, or V+M+), negative for MPXV antibodies but positive for VACV ones (MPXV- VACV+, or V+M-) and vice versa (MPXV+ VACV-, or V-M+) ( [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#T1)). Samples belonging to the VACV- MPXV- group were randomly selected from all VACV and MPXV VN negative samples from the born after 1979- and the born before 1975- birth cohorts, while the samples in the remaining exposure groups are all available samples fulfilling the specified criteria.\n\nTable 1\n\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1585284/fimmu-16-1585284-HTML/image_m/fimmu-16-1585284-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1585284/fimmu-16-1585284-HTML/image_m/fimmu-16-1585284-t001.jpg)\n\n**Table 1**. Serum samples selected from the previous study ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)) and grouped according to their neutralization profile (exposure group) and birth cohort.\n\n### MSD assay\n\nMeso Scale Diagnostics (MSD, LLC., Rockville, MD) is an immunoassay technology that use an electrochemiluminescent technology and micro plates with carbon electrodes integrated into each well. The V-PLEX Orthopoxvirus Serology Kit (MSD, LLC., Rockville, MD) quantitatively measures antibodies direct to MPXV and VACV viral proteins. Plates are provided with 10 viral antigens (5 MPXV proteins and their 5 orthologous VACV proteins) as listed in [Table 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#T2).\n\nTable 2\n\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1585284/fimmu-16-1585284-HTML/image_m/fimmu-16-1585284-t002.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1585284/fimmu-16-1585284-HTML/image_m/fimmu-16-1585284-t002.jpg)\n\n**Table 2**. List of antigens detected by the MSD kit: orthologous pairs, antigens description, protein length (number (N) of amino acids (aa), number of differing amino acids, percentage (%) of protein similarity and GenBank references.\n\nMSD assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, calibrators and controls were diluted according to the data sheet provided within the kit. Serum samples were diluted 1:100 in Diluent 100, included in the kit. After 30 minutes in blocking solution (Bovine serum albumin in a PBS-based buffer optimized for use with MSD) at room temperature (RT) with shaking, the plates were washed 3 times with 150 µl/well of the wash solution provided; 50 µl of each calibrator, control and diluted serum sample was then added to the plates, which were incubated for 2 hours at RT with shaking. After another washing step, 50 µl well of SULFO-TAG anti-human IgG antibody was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at RT with shaking. After a washing step, 150 µl/well of MSD GOLD Read Buffer B was added, and the plates were read on the MSD instrument.\n\nCalibration curves used to calculate antibody concentrations are established by fitting the signals from the calibrators to a 4-parameter logistic (or sigmoidal dose-response) model with a 1/Y2 weighting. Antibody unit concentrations in controls and diluted samples are determined from their electro chemiluminescent signals by backfitting to the calibration curve.\n\n### Statistical methods\n\nThe antibody concentration (AU/ml) for each pox antigen was calculated for each sample and used for the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with R studio and R version 4.4.2 ( [31](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B31)). For each antigen, median antibody levels by birth cohort and exposure group were calculated along with their corresponding interquartile ranges (IQR). Statistical significance was evaluated by Kruskal Wallis test in the four exposure groups (V-M-, V-M+, V+M- and V+M+); if significant a Dunn test was performed for comparisons with Holm’s correction for multiple tests. A Mann Whitney test was used to test equality for the age groups within the four exposure groups. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05, two-tailed. Correlations between VN titres for MPXV and VACV and median antibody levels of the 10 OPXV antigens for exposure groups and for the two birth cohorts was determined by Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r). Figures were generated using the ggplot2 R and GGally packages.\n\n## Results\n\n### Antibody levels and correlation with age\n\nBinding antibodies towards the 10 OPXV antigens were assessed by MSD in serum samples from the entire study group (N = 370).\n\nThe highest antibody levels were observed in subjects born before 1975 (older group), with anti-VACV A33R (median: 27,086; IQR 10,949 – 81,695 (V-M+)), anti-MPXV A35R (median: 19,795; IQR 6,372 – 52,485 (V+M+)), anti-VACV B5R (median: 22,333; IQR 4,461 – 58,064 (V+M+)) and anti-MPXV B6R (median: 20,780; IQR 4,516 – 53,952 (V+M+)) antibodies being the most abundant ( [Supplementary Table S1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)).\n\nVACV and MPXV VN positive individuals born after 1979 (younger group) displayed significantly lower antibody levels for most of the 10 OPXV antigens ( [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f1)) as compared to the subjects born before 1975 (older group). In the older age group, antibodies that bind MPXV M1R and VACV L1R were present at lower levels than antibodies binding the other assessed antigens; whereas in the younger cohort, the levels of antibodies towards M1R and L1R were comparable to those directed against the other 8 OPXV antigens ( [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f1)).

The positivity cut-off value is indicated per assay as the vertical dashed red line. Colors indicate birth cohort (Red: born after 1979 cohort; blue: born before 1975 cohort).\n\nAs the older age group putatively received the smallpox vaccination, which shown to provide some degree of cross-protection against mpox ( [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B4)), it is not surprising that binding antibody levels in this cohort were significantly lower in negative subjects than in those positive to at least one virus ( [Supplementary Figure S1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). Interestingly, however, median antibody concentrations to the 10 OPXV antigens within the older cohort were lower in the V+M- than in the V-M+ group (with the exception of antibodies against the VACV A27L antigen).\n\nAmong the 5 orthologue pairs, the antibody response directed against the E8L/D8L in the older group showed the greatest variability with respect to exposure to MPXV or VACV. Antibodies directed to VACV D8L were significantly higher in V-M+ individuals than in V+M- ones (p=0.002). This suggests that older MPXV-positive individuals negative for VACV have antibodies that cross-react with the VACV D8L, but older VACV-positive subjects negative for MPXV do not show the same level of antibody cross-reactivity towards the MPXV antigen E8L. No significant differences among exposure groups were instead observed in the younger cohort ( [Supplementary Figure S1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)).\n\nThe hypothesized disparity in cross-reactive potential highlighted in the older study population is also evident when considering the E8L/D8L antibody ratio according to birth cohort and exposure group ( [Supplementary Figure S2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)); in each serostatus in which positivity to at least one of the viruses is present, the ratio is always in favour of VACV D8L antigen, including in subjects positive for MPXV antibodies but negative for VACV ones. The antibody response directed towards the orthologue pair A35R/A33R, by contrast, appears to be the one for which the ratio is most consistent with the presumed exposure to MPXV (in the younger group) and VACV (in the older group), with differences that are always significant between the two age groups (V-M-, p = 0.019; V-M+, p < 0.0001; V+M-, p < 0.0001 and V+M+, p = 0.001) ( [Supplementary Figure S2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)).\n\nIn our previous study ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)), 44 individuals born after 1979 had positive VACV VN titres despite the lack of positive MPXV VN titres. In addition to the imbalance in the E8L/D8L pair, this observation seems to be also related to the A29L/A27L ortholog pair, for which the V+M- exposure group of this birth cohort shows an imbalance in favour of the VACV A27L antigen (p = 0.03 compared to the birth cohort born before 1975) ( [Supplementary Figure S2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). Similarly, 21 individuals in the cohort of those born before 1975 had MPXV positive VN titres but were VACV VN negative. In this case it can be observed that certain orthologous pairs (e.g. A29L/A27L and B6R/B5R) show no significant differences between the M+V- individuals belonging to the two birth cohorts ( [Supplementary Figure S2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)).\n\nThe correlation between binding antibody levels to the 10 OPXV antigens and age in the younger VACV-naïve group seems to increase over time ( [Supplementary Figure S3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)), contrary to what happens in the older age group ( [Supplementary Figure S4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). MPXV and VACV VN titres, instead, seem to increase with age in both age cohorts, with particular reference to the VACV VN titres in the older age group ( [Supplementary Figure S4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). While the correlation between neutralizing antibodies and age is always positive (regardless of the birth cohort and virus), the correlation between binding antibodies and age is always positive only in the younger individuals.\n\n### Correlation between binding antibody levels and neutralizing antibody titres\n\nBinding antibody responses to the assessed MPXV and VACV orthologues are strongly correlated ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f3)), reflecting the high sequence homology reported for these antigens pairs ( [Table 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#T2)).\n\nFigure 3\n\n[![Scatter plots compare log-transformed values of MPXV and VACV proteins: A29L to A27L, A35R to A33R, B6R to B5R, E8L to D8L, and M1R to L1R.

Correlation between monkeypox (MPXV) and Vaccinia (VACV) orthologues. Symbols and colors indicate birth cohort (circle: born after 1979; triangle: born before 1975) and exposure group (VN serostatus; red: V-M-, green: V-M+, blue: V+M-, purple: V+M+), respectively. The solid red line indicates the x = y line. Correlation coefficients along with their 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported for each panel. Dashed lines indicate cut-off values as defined by Hicks et al. ( [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B10)).\n\nThe strongest correlation was observed between antibodies targeting the orthologue pair B6R and B5R (r = 0.992) (sequence homology: 96.53%), followed by that between L1R and M1R antibodies (r = 0.988) (sequence homology: 98.80%), A35R and A33R antibodies (r = 0.982) (sequence homology: 93.37%) and A27L and A29L antibodies (r = 0.948) (sequence homology: 94.55%) ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f3)).\n\nA robust correlation (r = 0.886) is also shown between anti-E8L and anti-D8L antibodies. However, this is lower than in the other pairs of orthologues ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f3)), despite similarly high sequence homology of E8L and D8L (94.41%) ( [Table 2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#T2)). The reduced correlation is due to the younger age group (r = 0.760, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.676 – 0.825) as compared to the older one (r = 0.877, 95% CI 0.844 – 0.903; p = 0.00009) ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)). Notably, several non-orthologous antigen pairs also exhibited strong correlations in antibody responses. Analysis of correlations across the full study population revealed that antibodies targeting MPXV A35R were strongly associated with those directed to VACV B5R (r = 0.839), MPXV B6R (r = 0.830), VACV D8L (r = 0.807) and MPXV E8L (r = 0.727). Similarly, the presence of VACV A33R antibodies was highly correlated with that of antibodies against VACV B5R (r = 0.861), MPXV B6R (r = 0.853), VACV D8L (r = 0.835) and MPXV E8L (r = 0.746). A marked correlation has also been observed between MPXV E8L antibodies and those towards MPXV B6R (r = 0.716) and VACV B5R (r = 0.721); as well as between VACV D8L antibodies with those directed to VACV B5R (r = 0.792) and MPXV B6R (r = 0.784) ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)). This seems to indicate that exposure to immunodominant antigens such as A35R, A33R, B5R or B6R does not hamper development of immune responses towards less immunogenic targets such as E8L.\n\nFigure 4\n\n[![Scatterplot matrix showing relationships between ten variables, labeled as MPXV and VACV markers.

Total correlations between VN titers for MPXV and VACV and median antibody levels of the 10 OPXV antigens and by birth cohort (born before 1975, old and born after 1979, young) was determined by Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r).\n\nWhen analyzing the contribution of age, in 4 out of 5 orthologues pairs (i.e., all except A27L vs A29L) and in most non-orthologue pairs, correlations between VACV- and MPXV- binding antibodies are higher in the younger age group ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)). Looking at either orthologues or non-orthologues correlations in the different exposure groups, the highest correlations between binding antibodies are generally in the V-M+ group ( [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f5)).\n\nFigure 5\n\n[![A grid of scatter plots compares multiple variables with correlation coefficients and significance levels.

Correlation between monkeypox (MPXV) and Vaccinia (VACV) antigens and virus neutralization (VN) assay (log2-tranformed axes). Total correlations between VN titers for MPXV and VACV and median antibody levels of the 10 OPXV antigens and by exposure group (VACV+ MPXV+, V+M+; VACV+ MPXV-, V+M-; VACV- MPXV+, V-M+; VACV- MPXV-, V-M-) was determined by Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient (r).\n\nThe correlation between VACV and MPXV VN titers in the sub-cohort of 370 subjects included the present study is positive but moderate (r = 0.580) and slightly higher in the older age group than in the younger one (Born before 1975, older group: r = 0.557; Born after 1979, younger group: r = 0.518) ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)), in line with what previously observed within the larger study group of 1000 subjects ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)). This association is entirely due to the V+M+ exposure group (r = 0.556), as extremely low or negative correlations were reported in the V+M- (r = 0.161) and V-M+ (r = -0.019) profiles ( [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f5)).\n\nInterestingly, both VACV VN and MPXV VN correlate poorly with the 10 OPXV antigens, and some degree of low but significant correlation is nearly entirely due to antibodies in the older age group ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)). The only case where a significant, albeit low, correlation was observed between VN and OPXV antigens is the case of MPXV neutralizing antibodies and A35R-binding antibodies in the younger age group ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)).\n\nIf looking at exposure profiles, the strongest correlations between MPXV VN titers and binding antibodies are observed in the V-M+ groups. In this latter population, MPXV VN shows the highest and most significant associations with MPXV E8L (r = 0.518), MPXV M1R (r = 0.509) and VACV L1R (r = 0.532) antibodies. VACV VN titers exhibited slightly lower (yet statistically significant) and similar correlations with binding antibodies against VACV and MPXV antigens, largely driven by individuals with a V+M- serostatus. The highest association in this case was found with VACV D8L antibodies (r = 0.408) ( [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f5)).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study provides an in-depth analysis of binding antibody responses to 10 OPXV antigens, with a particular focus on differences in immune profiles between individuals according to their neutralization activity to MPXV and VACV and their age.\n\nOur data confirm that certain MPXV and VACV antigens elicit stronger immune responses than others. The highest antibody levels were observed for the orthologous pairs A35R/A33R and B6R/B5R, supporting their role as highly immunogenic targets. This is consistent with previous studies indicating that surface proteins, particularly those associated with the EEV form (i.e., A33R/A35R and B5R/B6R), are the most immunodominant ( [12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B12), [32](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B32), [33](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B33)). In contrast, L1R, although immunogenic, is part of the inner capsid of the IMV and may not be as readily exposed to the immune system in a natural infection context ( [32](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B32)). In agreement with previous serological studies ( [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B6), [33](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B33)), the L1R/M1R pair exhibited the lowest antibody levels across all exposure groups. One of the main findings of the present study is that MPXV-specific antibodies exhibit greater binding cross-reactivity and may have potential for higher cross-neutralizing capacity compared to the VACV antibodies. The data suggest in fact that individuals with MPXV-neutralizing titres have stronger binding antibody levels to VACV antigens than those with VACV-neutralizing titers do to MPXV antigens. This is particularly true for antibodies targeting the E8L/D8L orthologue pair, which showed higher binding cross-reactivity in MPXV-positive individuals compared to VACV-positive individuals ( [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f1) and [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)). Our analysis also revealed that MPXV E8L-specific antibodies exhibit one of the strongest associations with neutralization activity in MPXV-positive individuals. These findings align with the fact that cross-protection afforded by the two viruses might be asymmetrical, as speculated previously when looking at neutralization data ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)). Additionally, the likelihood of being VACV-positive if MPXV-positive and vice versa is lower in the younger age group as compared to the older one. This may once again indicate a non-bi-directional cross-reactivity of the humoral response elicited towards E8L and D8L ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)).\n\nNotably, MPXV antibodies in younger individuals appear less functionally mature (i.e., binding but not neutralizing), suggesting that natural infections alone may not elicit a robust neutralizing response. As younger individuals have not been vaccinated against smallpox, they may only have been exposed to MPXV or similar viruses (e.g. CPXV). It is conceivable that young people may only have more specific antibodies to MPXV than to VACV, appearing to be the result of a “primary” response, with lower antibody levels ( [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f1)) and less specific, i.e., more reactive in terms of binding towards VACV ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)). Consequently, it can be hypothesized that the binding response driven by MPXV-specific antibodies is more cross-reactive and broader, and more adept at binding VACV than vice versa.\n\nIn older subjects, the imprinting of the historical smallpox vaccination may have exerted a significant influence, with both stronger neutralization and binding responses. The group born before 1975 exhibited considerably higher antibody levels in comparison to the younger age group, irrespective of the antigen considered ( [Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f1)). It is plausible that the older population has received a natural boost over time due to exposure to either smallpox/VACV vaccine boosters (prior to disease eradication) or other OPXV including MPXV. This suggests that prior VACV vaccination followed by subsequent antigenic boosting from potential exposure to other OPXV (including MPXV) has led to the development of a more VACV-specific immune response over time, likely due to vaccine imprinting, rather than a response directed towards MPXV or other OPXV. In our previous study ( [26](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B26)), a subset of individuals born after 1979 - who are not supposed to have been exposed to VACV due to the cessation of smallpox vaccination in the 1980s - exhibited positive VACV neutralization titres despite lacking MPXV-neutralizing activity. We hypothesize that this could be explained by the observed imbalance in the immune response to the E8L/D8L antigen pair, potentially leading to antibodies that preferentially cross-react with the VACV D8L antigen, regardless of whether exposure was to MPXV or VACV. In addition, it may also be related to the differential cross-reactivity towards the A29L/A27L ortholog pair: among people born after 1979, those belonging to the V+M- exposure group have an imbalance in the antibody ratio in favour of the VACV A27L antigen compared to the MPXV A29 antigen ( [Supplementary Figure S2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). This raised the possibility that exposure to other OPXV, such as CPXV or other zoonotic poxviruses ( [34](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B34), [35](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B35)), may have contributed to the observed data, as also reported in other serological studies ( [36](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B36), [37](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B37)). Similarly, some individuals in the cohort of those born before 1975 displayed MPXV-neutralizing antibodies but lacked neutralizing activity against VACV. This not expected as this population has likely been immunized with VACV via the smallpox vaccine. It can be however observed that the magnitude of the humoral response directed to certain orthologous pairs (such as A29L/A27L and B6R/B5R) is similar between the V-M+ individuals across to the two birth cohorts, as shown by the absence of statistically significant differences in antibody ratio ( [Supplementary Figure S2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)), indicating that antibodies elicited upon exposure to certain antigens may have the same capability to bind the corresponding orthologue and further emphasizing the complexity of cross-reactive immune responses in different age cohorts. Overall, results of the present study in the two sub-groups evaluated showed that antibodies in the young unvaccinated population (who has likely fewer chances of encountering OPXV antigens with respect to older individuals) tend to increase their binding rather than their neutralizing capacity ( [Supplementary Figure S3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)), as opposed to the older population ( [Supplementary Figure S4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). The humoral response in this latter case may be the result of both VACV vaccine imprinting and possible natural boosters from CPXV or other zoonotic poxviruses infections (hybrid immunity), which may have induced mainly VACV-reactive antibodies with increased specificity and neutralizing capacity for VACV.\n\nSurprisingly, despite the high correlation observed between binding humoral responses towards MPXV and VACV orthologous antigen pairs ( [Figure 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f3)), the association between MPXV and VACV neutralizing antibodies remains moderate regardless of the age group ( [Figure 4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f4)), and entirely attributed to the presence of antibodies against both viruses (V+M+ serostatus) ( [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f5)). This could mean that MPXV antibodies alone (V-M+ exposure group), which are presumably not sufficiently boosted and resulting only from (limited) natural infections, are cross-reactive and broader in their binding ability but not in their neutralizing ability. This is particularly evident in the younger population, in which antibodies displayed an enhanced capability for binding over neutralization ( [Supplementary Figure S3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). Similarly, the presence of VACV antibodies alone (V+M- profile) may not be adequate to provide adequate cross-neutralization of MPXV, especially considering that potential exposures to other OPXV over time may lead to a more VACV-specific neutralizing response in smallpox-vaccinated subjects, as observed in the older population of this study ( [Supplementary Figure S4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm)). Indeed, VACV and MPXV neutralizing titers correlate better with antibodies that bind the homologous virus, as shown by the fact that the highest associations are observed in the V+M- group for VACV neutralizing antibodies and in the V-M+ group for MPXV neutralizing antibodies ( [Figure 5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#f5)). Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of repeated immunizations with MPXV antigens to enhance the development of cross-neutralizing antibodies against MPXV.\n\nOur study has some limitations. Firstly, there is missing information on smallpox vaccination of the subjects as well as their clinical or travel history. This includes information on previous MPXV or other OPXV infections. Other factors, such as underlying health conditions (e.g. autoimmune disorders or immunocompromising conditions), may also influence immunological responses ( [38](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B38), [39](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B39)). We have used the cut-off values as reported by Hicks et al. ( [27](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#B27)) as a reference, but these are only partially helpful in distiguishing between the different exposure groups from our study. It would have been useful to determine what the cut-off values would be for the 10 antigens in non-OPXV exposed subjects, which we are unable to do due to the unavailability of samples and tests. Given the recent MPXV outbreak, this study is especially pertinent. It explores how prior smallpox vaccination or OPXV exposure affects the immune response to the current MPXV strain, thereby examining cross-protective immunity between MPXV and other OPXV, including smallpox. The observed differences in immune responses between younger and older individuals highlight the impact of historical smallpox vaccination, suggesting that vaccine imprinting plays a crucial role in shaping long-term immunity against OPXV, including MPXV. The development of antibody responses over time, as well as their affinity, avidity, and cross-reactivity, may be better understood through a longitudinal study. Future studies should explore whether modern vaccines can be optimized to induce similarly robust responses in younger populations who lack prior smallpox vaccination-induced immunity.\n\nIn conclusion, this study investigated the antigenic determinants of previously observed broadly neutralizing antibody responses, to elucidate the actual breadth of serum cross-neutralization to VACV and MPXV. These findings contribute to our understanding of the differential immune responses to MPXV based on vaccination history and age-related exposure and provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation MPXV vaccines.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ [Supplementary Material](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1585284/full#hsm), further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author/s.\n\n## Ethics statement\n\nEthical approval was not required for the studies involving humans because all experiments were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.

As the monkeypox virus (MPXV) is rapidly spreading in the world, we would like to investigate whether the individuals with historic VACV Tiantan strain vaccination, even after more than 40 years, could still provide ELISA reactivity and neutralizing protection; and whether the unvaccinated individuals have no antibody reactivity against MPXV at all.\n\n### Results\n\nWe established serologic ELISA to measure the serum anti-MPXV titer by using immunodominant MPXV surface proteins, A35R, B6R, A29L, and M1R. A small proportion of individuals (born before 1980) with historic VACV Tiantan strain vaccination exhibited serum ELISA cross-reactivity against these MPXV surface proteins. Consistently, these donors also showed ELISA seropositivity and serum neutralization against VACV Tiantan strain. However, surprisingly, some unvaccinated young adults (born after 1980) also showed potent serum ELISA activity against MPXV proteins, possibly due to their past infection by some self-limiting Orthopoxvirus (OPXV).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe report the serum ELISA cross-reactivity against MPXV surface protein in a small proportion of individuals both with and without VACV Tiantan strain vaccination history. Combined with our serum neutralization assay against VACV and the recent literature about mice vaccinated with VACV Tiantan strain, our study confirmed the anti-MPXV cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization of smallpox vaccine using VACV Tiantan strain. Therefore, it is necessary to restart the smallpox vaccination program in high risk populations.\n\n## Background\n\nSince May 2022, an emerging monkeypox (renamed as “mpox” by World Health Organization) outbreak has occurred and quickly spread globally, posing a critical international threat. In July 2022, World Health Organization (WHO) declared monkeypox as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) \\[ [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR1 \"Gessain A, Nakoune E, Yazdanpanah Y. Monkeypox. N Engl J Med. 2022;387(19):1783–93.\")\\]. Although the monkeypox outbreak is no longer a global health emergency, there are still new cases of infection globally and the available clinical strategy for prevention and treatment is still limited at present\\[ [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR2 \"Huang Y, Mu L, Wang W.

The OPXV genus contains many species, including variola virus (VARV) responsible for human smallpox, vaccinia virus (VACV) intensively used for human immunization for smallpox eradication, cowpox virus (CPXV), the causative agent of cowpox, camelpox virus (CMLV), ectromelia (mouse) virus (ECTV), and MPXV \\[ [4](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR4 \"Babkin IV, Babkina IN, Tikunova NV.

Compared with the high virulence and mortality rate (up to 30%) caused by smallpox, the mortality rate caused by MPXV infection in the past outbreaks in Africa was around 3% to 6%, while below 1% in the current outbreak \\[ [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR1 \"Gessain A, Nakoune E, Yazdanpanah Y.

Therefore, a series of crucial questions related to general Chinese populations need to be answered: (1) After the eradication of smallpox in China in 1979, vaccination with the VACV Tiantan strain for the general population was stopped in 1980. Could the individuals previously vaccinated with VACV Tiantan strain still have cross-reactive antibodies against a broad range of MPXV surface proteins?

(3) Do unvaccinated individuals have no serum ELISA reactivity against MPXV at all?\n\nTo answer these questions, we decided to express MPXV surface proteins and to develop ELISA to determine the antibody titer in our recruited volunteers.

MPXV homologs of these six proteins are H3L, E8L, M1R, and A29L on MV, and A35R and B6R on EV.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Serologic ELISA\n\nTo establish serologic ELISA, we successfully expressed recombinant extracellular domains of four MPXV surface antigens in _E. coli_: A35R (amino acid residues 90–181, 96.1% homologous to VACV antigen A33R) and B6R (amino acid residues 20–277, 95.9% homologous to VACV antigen B5R) on EV, and A29L (amino acid residues 21–110, 93.6% homologous to VACV antigen A27L) and M1R (amino acid residues 1–185, 98.8% homologous to VACV antigen L1R) on MV (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S1).

Served as positive controls, the two collected serum samples showed ELISA positivity as expected (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S3).\n\nThen we performed serologic ELISA using the sera collected from the 249 volunteers we recruited from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University. Among these volunteers, 62% (154/249) were female with a median age of 42 years old, while 38% (95/249) were male with a median age of 32 years old (Additional file [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM2): Table. S1). Serologic ELISA against MPXV A35R showed distinct levels of serum binding activity, with the area under the curve (AUC) values varied from 6.0 to 28.2. Among 249 samples, 4.4% (11/249) showed AUC values higher than 24, while the majority of the samples (85.1%, 212/249) showed AUC values lower than 18 (Fig. [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig1) A).\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\n[![figure 1](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12915-023-01699-8/MediaObjects/12915_2023_1699_Fig1_HTML.png)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/1)\n\nSerologic ELISA against four MPXV surface proteins. The serum antibody binding reactivity against MPXV surface proteins, A35R ( **A**), B6R ( **B**), A29L ( **C**), and M1R ( **D**), was determined by ELISA and shown by calculated area under the curve (AUC) values. Each line represents a donor’s serum sample, and the line’s height shows the serum reactivity level against the indicated antigen protein. The 249 serum samples were ranked according to their serum antibody binding activity. Red, individuals born before 1980; blue, individuals born after 1980. The percentages for the individuals born before/after 1980 were shown as pie charts for each section (ELISA values 6 ~ 12, 12 ~ 18, 18 ~ 24, and 24 ~ 30). The statistical analysis was performed and the p value in (A) was calculated by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test\n\n[Full size image](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/1)\n\nSimilarly, we further performed serologic ELISA against the other three MPXV antigens, B6R, A29L, and M1R, and showed varied AUC values from 14.7 to 28.5, 11.4 to 27.0, and 6.3 to 27.9, respectively (Fig. [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig1) B-D). As shown, ELISA against B6R and A29L showed higher background levels compared with ELISA against A35R and M1R (Fig. [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig1)). Among 249 donors, 23.3% (58/249), 8.4% (21/249) and 4.4% (11/249) individuals showed potent serum antibody responses (AUC values higher than 24) against B6R, A29L, and M1R, respectively.\n\n### Clustering, comparison and correlation analysis of ELISA data\n\nTo further evaluate the breadth of serum reactivity against MPXV surface proteins, we clustered all serum samples based on the four ELISA values of each serum sample (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) A). We identified the top 13 (13/249 ≈ 5%) antibody responders with broad serum reactivity to all four MPXV antigens (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). Among these top 13 antibody responders, six of them (#231, #230, #072, #134, #143, and #238) were born before 1980, while seven donors (#111, #152, #106, #222, #151, #160, and #221) were born after 1980 (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). Particularly, donors #231, #111, #152, and #106, displayed robust antibody binding activity (AUC values higher than 24) to all four antigens (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). As expected, two positive sera collected from VACV-infected donors \\[ [22](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR22 \"Lu B, Cui LB, Gu MH, Shi C, Sun CW, Zhao KC, et al.

Together, we conclude that the serum antibody responses against four representative immunodominant MPXV antigens vary considerably among individuals, with only a small proportion of individuals exhibiting potent and broad serum anti-MPXV binding activity.\n\n**Fig. 2**\n\n[![figure 2](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12915-023-01699-8/MediaObjects/12915_2023_1699_Fig2_HTML.png)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/2)\n\nA small proportion of individuals possessed robust antibody reactivity against all four tested MPXV surface proteins. **A** Clustering analysis using the relative serum antibody binding activities against A35R, B6R, A29L, and M1R. **B** Serologic ELISA AUC values and vaccination status of the top 13 (5%) individuals with stronger antibody cross-reactivity against MPXV.

No difference of antibody titer against A35R ( _p_ = 0.079), B6R ( _p_ = 0.30) and M1R ( _p_ = 0.69) was observed between genders (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S4). Further comparison showed that body mass index (BMI) had no significant impact on the serum antibody responses (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S4).\n\nBoth A35R and B6R are localized on EV, while both A29L and M1R are on MV. Serum antibody titers against A35R, B6R, A29L, and M1R were all positively correlated with each other with r scores ranging from 0.46 to 0.65 ( _p_ < 0.0001) (Fig. [3](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig3) A-F). Due to these comprehensive correlations, it was less likely that the robust serum antibody titer against any one MPXV antigens was just ELISA background or caused by some unspecific binding. On the contrary, these positive correlations implied a simultaneous exposure to these viral antigens or their homologous proteins.\n\n**Fig. 3**\n\n[![figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12915-023-01699-8/MediaObjects/12915_2023_1699_Fig3_HTML.png)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/3)\n\nCorrelation analysis. **A-F** Correlations were analyzed using the relative serum antibody binding activities to A35R, B6R, A29L, and M1R.

Accordingly, the individuals born before 1980 were very likely to be vaccinated, while no individuals born after 1980 have been vaccinated by VACV Tiantan strain. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the donors’ vaccination status mainly based on their age.\n\nTo further confirm the donors’ vaccination status, we first contacted the top 13 antibody responders and successfully confirmed the vaccination status of 11 of them by phone interview (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). Among these top 13 antibody responders, six were born before 1980 and five of them affirmed their historical smallpox vaccination (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). For the seven donors born after 1980, six were successfully contacted and confirmed their unvaccinated status.\n\nWe also contacted all of the donors born before 1980 by phone interview (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S5). Among the 98 donors born before 1980, 66 donors were successfully contacted. 62 donors confirmed their smallpox vaccination history (using VACV Tiantan strain), while the rest four donors were not sure (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S5).\n\nAmong our recruited donors, around 40% (98/249) individuals were born before 1980 with ages ranging from 43 to 83 years old and a median age of 55 years old (Additional file [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM2): Table.

Among those born before 1980, ELISA results suggested that 9.0%, 21.4%, 8.2%, and 5.0% individuals showed potent serum reactivity (AUC values higher than 24) against A35R, B6R, A29L, and M1R, respectively (Fig. [4](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig4)). Statistical analysis showed that those born before 1980 had a significantly stronger anti-A35R antibody reactivity ( _p_ = 0.0132) than the younger group (Fig. [4](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig4) A). Anti-B6R ( _p_ = 0.5243), anti-A29L ( _p_ = 0.7344), and anti-M1R ( _p_ = 0.1353) reactivity did not appear significantly different between these two groups (Fig. [4](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig4) B-D).

Among the top 13 antibody responders (donors with high levels of antibody cross-reactivity to all four antigens), seven were born after 1980 and have never received any smallpox vaccination (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). It is worth mentioning that one donor #111 was born in 2001 (Fig. [2](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig2) B). Together, these results suggest that a small proportion of individuals without any orthopoxvirus-related vaccination could also develop antibody reactivity against MPXV.\n\nHow could these unvaccinated young donors (born after 1980) develop robust serum antibody activity against MPXV? We hypothesized that these volunteers have been exposed to VACV, VACV-like, CPXV, or CPXV-like viruses. Human infections with these OPXVs are most often self-limiting and only cause mild diseases. For example, infections with CPXV and VACV-like agents have been recently reported in Germany, India, and Brazil \\[ [30](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR30 \"Pauli G, Blumel J, Burger R, Drosten C, Groner A, Gurtler L, et al.

However, this did not exclude the possibility of previous OPXV infection. Since OPXV infection is usually self-limiting with only minor symptoms, such as fever and lymph node swelling, the OPXV infection would usually be confused with common inflammation \\[ [8](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR8 \"Shchelkunova GA, Shchelkunov SN.

Moreover, due to the fact that the test assay for OPXV infection, qualitative real-time PCR, is usually not available in hospitals in China, but only provided by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it would be very uncommon for the patients in hospitals to have their samples delivered to CDC for laboratory test for OPXV detection and genotyping.\n\nTo further test this hypothesis and examine the serum cross-reactivity for those unvaccinated young donors (born after 1980), we expressed and purified two recombinant A35R proteins, A35R-h1 and A35R-h2, for serologic ELISA (Fig. [6](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig6) A). Specifically, A35R-h1 recombinant protein shared the same amino acid sequence with the A35R homologs of five VACV strains; while A35R-h2 recombinant protein shared the same amino acid sequence with the A35R homologs of one CPXV, five CPXV-like 1, and eight CPXV-like 2 strains (Fig. [6](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig6) A).\n\n**Fig. 6**\n\n[![figure 6](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12915-023-01699-8/MediaObjects/12915_2023_1699_Fig6_HTML.png)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/6)\n\nSerum cross-reactivity with A35R homologs of OPXV strains. **A** Amino acid sequence alignment of MPXV A35R protein, its homologs from VACV (red), VACV-like (orange), CPXV (yellow), CPXV-like-1 (green), CPXV-like-2 (purple) and CPXV-like-3 (blue) strains. The different amino acid residues (compared to MPXV A35R) are labeled in yellow. Two recombinant A35R homologous proteins, A35R-h1 and A35R-h2, were expressed for serologic ELISA. The A35R-h1 recombinant protein shared the same amino acid sequence with the A35R homologs of five VACV strains (the red arrow line). The A35R-h2 recombinant protein shared the same amino acid sequence with the A35R homologs of one CPXV, five CPXV-like-1, and eight CPXV-like-2 strains (the blue arrow lines). **B-E** Serologic ELISA AUC values for two VACV-infected donors ( **B**), eight donors with low reactivity against MPXV proteins ( **C**), and the top 13 antibody responders against MPXV proteins ( **D** and **E**). Red, individuals born before 1980; blue, individuals born after 1980; orange, individuals recovered from previous VACV infection\n\n[Full size image](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/6)\n\nAs positive controls, two serum samples collected from VACV-infected donors exhibited strong serum cross-reactivity against both A35R-h1 and A35R-h2 (Fig. [6](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig6) B); while the eight negative control sera showed background signals, irrespective of the donors’ age (Fig. [6](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig6) C). All of the top 13 antibody responders with high levels of serum ELISA activity to all four MPXV antigens, including seven donors born after 1980 and six born before 1980, showed robust serum ELISA signals against the two recombinant A35R proteins (Fig. [6](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig6) D and E). Together, these results confirmed the serum cross-reactivity with A35R homologs of VACV, CPXV, CPXV-like 1 and CPXV-like 2 strains, further strengthening our hypothesis that some unvaccinated young donors (born after 1980) have been exposed to other OPXV strains.\n\n### Serum neutralization capacity against VACV Tiantan strain\n\nTo investigate the serum neutralization capacity, we established and performed in vitro neutralization assays using VACV Tiantan strain. The BHK21 cells were infected with VACV Tiantan strain in the presence of polyclonal IgG antibodies purified from different donors’ serum. To evaluate the infection rate, plaque numbers were then counted and the relative area covered by plaques were measured. Higher number of plaques and more area covered by plaques indicated a higher level of VACV infection.\n\nCompared with the virus-only control, the polyclonal IgG antibodies purified from the two VACV-infected donors (positive controls) showed efficient suppression on VACV infection (Fig. [7](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig7) A). Antibodies purified from the donors with low levels of serum ELISA reactivity (negative controls) barely neutralized VACV Tiantan strain (Fig. [7](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig7) B). For the top 13 antibody responders with robust anti-MPXV ELISA signals, there are two scenarios (Fig. [7](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig7) C-F). The donors born after 1980 showed no statistically significant difference in serum neutralizing capacity, compared with virus-only and negative controls ( _p_ = 0.602) (Fig. [7](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig7) C, E and F). Compared with the donors born after 1980, the donors born before 1980 with historical smallpox vaccination showed significantly higher levels of serum neutralizing activity ( _p_ < 0.0001) (Fig. [7](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig7) D-F). Together, these results suggested that the individuals with smallpox vaccination, even after more than 40 years, still showed serum neutralization against VACV Tiantan strain.\n\n**Fig. 7**\n\n[![figure 7](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12915-023-01699-8/MediaObjects/12915_2023_1699_Fig7_HTML.png)](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8/figures/7)\n\nSerum neutralization against VACV Tiantan strain. **A-D** In vitro neutralization assay against VACV Tiantan strain in the presence of polyclonal IgG antibodies purified from the indicated donors.

However, since MPXV and VACV share an approximately 95% sequence similarity for immunodominant antigens, such as A35R, B6R, A29L and M1R (Fig. [5](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig5)), it is very likely that the mAbs neutralizing VACV in vitro could also neutralize MPXV.

Therefore, we speculate that these donors born before 1980 with serum neutralization against VACV Tiantan strain have cross-neutralizing activity against MPXV.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn summary, our newly established serologic ELISA using immunodominant MPXV surface proteins could quickly and efficiently measure the serum anti-MPXV titer. A small proportion of individuals with historic VACV Tiantan strain vaccination more than 40 years ago exhibited serum antibody cross-reactivity against MPXV surface proteins.

Surprisingly, some unvaccinated young adults exhibited potent serum anti-MPXV activity but no serum neutralizing activity against VACV; and this is probably due to their past infection by some self-limiting VACV, CPXV or CPXV-like variants. Therefore, it is necessary to restart the smallpox vaccination program in high risk populations; and to further study the antibody response in donors with distinct immunization history would greatly facilitate the understanding and the development of therapeutic antibody drugs.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Collection of human serum\n\nThe study complied with relevant ethical guidelines and was approved by Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University Ethics Committee (approval number: FE22224R). Volunteer recruitment and blood draws were performed at the Fudan University Hospital. All participants provided written informed consent. Serum samples were isolated by centrifugation of coagulated whole blood, and aliquoted for storage at -80°C.\n\n### Protein expression and purification\n\nThe nucleotide sequences for the extracellular domain of A35R (residues 90 to 181), B6R (residues 20 to 277), A29L (residues 21 to 110), and M1R (residues 1 to 185) from monkeypox virus (2022MPXV or lineage B.1, GenBank accession numbers: ON585029 ~ ON585038), MPXV A35R homologous recombinant protein A35R-h1 and A35R-h2 (Fig. [6](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig6) A) were synthesized (GENEWIZ) and cloned into pET-28a( +) expression vector. These expression vectors were transformed into _E. coli_ BL21 (DE3) cells and grown in LB medium containing 50 μg /ml kanamycin at 37℃. The protein expression was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM when the cell culture reached an OD600 of 0.6–0.8. Cells were cultured for 10 h at 16℃, and then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 500 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF, and subjected to sonication on ice to lyse the cells. Inclusion bodies were pelleted and washed with 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, and 1% TritonX-100 for multiple times. After the final wash, inclusion bodies were dissolved in solubilization buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 6 M guanidine-HCl, and 2 mM DTT). The undissolved material was further removed by centrifugation at 19,000 g for 30 min, while the solubilized fraction was rapidly diluted with refolding buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 400 mM L-arginine-HCl, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, and 5 mM reduced glutathione). After 24 h incubation, the refolded proteins were dialyzed against 100 volumes of dialysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride) for three times and then centrifuged at 19,000 g for 30 min to remove any undissolved materials. Further purification was performed by subjecting the refolded proteins to nickel and size exclusion columns. The fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -80℃.\n\n### Antibody cloning and purification\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) VACV-22 \\[ [21](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR21 \"Gilchuk I, Gilchuk P, Sapparapu G, Lampley R, Singh V, Kose N, et al.

In this study, we did not investigate the serologic ELISA against MPXV H3L and E8L proteins, due to the contamination and low yield of their recombinant proteins expressed in _E. coli_.\n\nFor serologic ELISA, the serum samples of two donors who have been recovered from VACV infection in 2017 were used as positive controls (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S3). We optimized the protein coating concentration and determined appropriate initial serum dilution ratio. Starting dilution at 1:10 for sera resulted in a high ELISA background, while using 1:100 as the initial dilution ratio failed to distinguish differences. Therefore, 1:30 was chosen as the initial serum dilution ratio in our ELISAs.\n\nBased on the preliminary results (Additional file [1](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#MOESM1): Fig. S2), 96-well plates were coated overnight with 50 µl per well of antigen (1 µg/ml for A35R, A29L, M1R, A35R-h1, and A35R-h2; and 3 µg/ml for B6R) at 4℃. Followed by wash using PBST (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS), the plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Subsequently, serum samples (or control mAbs) were added into each well, with threefold serially diluted for eight dilutions starting at 1:30 for serum (or 10 µg/ml for mAbs). After one-hour incubation at room temperature, the HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added for detection. To evaluate the antigen-binding capacity of sera or mAbs, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) by using PRISM analysis.\n\n### Similarity in sequence alignment\n\nThe genome sequence of 2022MPXV (lineage B.1) was submitted by Joana Isidro, et al. to NCBI GenBank database under accession No. ON585035 \\[ [47](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR47 \"Isidro J, Borges V, Pinto M, Sobral D, Santos JD, Nunes A, et al. Phylogenomic characterization and signs of microevolution in the 2022 multi-country outbreak of monkeypox virus. Nat Med. 2022;28(8):1569–72.\")\\]. GenBank accession number of other aligned OPXV sequences were listed with corresponding percentages of amino acid identity (Fig. [5](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#Fig5)). Amino acid sequences of A35R, B6R, A29L, M1R and their homologs were identified by genome annotation in GenBank, and their sequence identities were calculated by using Align tool of UniProt knowledgebase ( [https://www.uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/)).\n\n### Neutralization assay using VACV Tiantan strain\n\nVACV Tiantan strain were prepared and titered using BHK 21 cells. BHK 21 cells were maintained in MEM medium supplemented with 5% fatal bovine serum (Gibco). For production of the viral stock, the VACV virus was added into BHK 21 cells and incubated for 72 h prior to harvest. After three times of rapid freeze–thaw of the infected cells, followed by the removal of cell debris by centrifugation and filtering, the virus soup was collected, aliquoted, and stored at -80℃. For viral infection, different dilution of the VACV viral stock were incubated with monolayer BHK 21 cells for 48 h. The cultured medium was discarded and the cells were fixed for crystal violet staining to visualize the formed plaques as the result of cytopathic effect (CPE). Neutralization capacity of the purified polyclonal IgG antibodies was performed as previously described \\[ [35](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-023-01699-8#ref-CR35 \"Criscuolo E, Giuliani B, Ferrarese R, Ferrari D, Locatelli M, Clementi M, et al. Smallpox vaccination-elicited antibodies cross-neutralize 2022-Monkeypox virus Clade II. J Med Virol. 2023;95(3):e28643.\")\\]. The mixture of virus stock and polyclonal IgG antibodies (final concentration, 2 μ g/μ l) were added into monolayer BHK 21 cells for 2 h incubation. The cells were then cultured in fresh medium for additional 48 h and subjected for plaque visualization. Plaque numbers were counted and the relative area covered by the plaques were also measured, both by BioSpot Colony Software system installed on CTL ImmunoSpot® reader (Cellular Technology Limited). All samples, including no virus control, virus-only control, and purified polyclonal IgG antibody samples, were tested for at least two times.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe detailed information of statistical analysis could be found in the Figure Legends. The ELISA area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated in PRISM software. Statistical significance was calculated by Mann Whitney t-test or two-tailed Fisher’s exact test or unpaired Student’s t test, while the correlation was evaluated by Spearman’s rank correlation method.\n\n## Availability of data and materials\n\nData generated or analyzed during this study are all included in this manuscript and its additional files.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nVACV:\n\nVaccinia virus\n\nMPXV:\n\nMonkeypox virus\n\nOPXV:\n\nOrthopoxvirus\n\nWHO:\n\nWorld health organization\n\nPHEIC:\n\nPublic health emergency of international concern\n\nVARV:\n\nVariola virus\n\nCPXV:\n\nCowpox virus\n\nCMLV:\n\nCamelpox virus\n\nECTV:\n\nEctromelia virus\n\nORFs:\n\nOpen reading frames\n\nMV:\n\nMature virion\n\nEV:\n\nExtracellular enveloped virion\n\nmAbs:\n\nMonoclonal antibodies\n\nAUC:\n\nArea under the curve\n\nCDC:\n\nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n## References\n\n01.
