Both types spread the same way and can be prevented using the same methods.\n- There have been more than 40,000 cases of clade I monkeypox in several countries in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- There have also been several travel-associated clade I monkeypox cases reported in countries in other parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.\n- There's an outbreak of clade II monkeypox in West Africa. Several cases in the United States have been tied to travel from the area.\n- Clade II monkeypox cases continue to spread at low levels in many countries around the world.\n- CDC works with public health partners across the world to monitor for monkeypox cases and increase surveillance capacity, in addition to other activities.\n\n\n![A colorized transmission electron microscopic image of monkeypox virus particles, found within an infected cell](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/09/26500_lores.jpg)\n\n## Current situation\n\n### In the United States\n\n- Health authorities in Southern California have reported three cases of clade I monkeypox in people with no recent travel. All three individuals are recovering from the illness. Viral genomic (DNA fingerprint) data indicate that these three cases may be linked to a different US case reported in August 2025. For more information see [Community Spread of Clade I Mpox Within California](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/CAHAN/Community-Spread-of-Clade-I-Mpox-Within-California.aspx).\n- There have been six reported cases of clade I monkeypox in the United States in people who had recently traveled to affected areas associated with the outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- CDC regularly [assesses the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to the overall population and specific populations within the United States posed by the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/); it remains low.\n- Clade II monkeypox is [still circulating at low levels](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/data-research/cases/index.html).\n  - CDC is tracking a recent uptick of U.S. cases of clade II across several different states linked to an [outbreak of clade II monkeypox in Sierra Leone, Liberia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), and other West African countries. CDC is collaborating with U.S. laboratories and Sierra Leone contacts to better understand the situation.\n- Children have historically gotten monkeypox in endemic areas in Western and Central Africa, and in this outbreak the high number of children with monkeypox reported in likely reflects spread within households.\n  - Based on what we know right now, we [don't expect to see the same sort of risk in children](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/data-research/clade-i-monkeypox-in-children-in-africa-and-potential-impacts-on-children-in-the-united-states.html) if monkeypox were introduced in the United States for reasons including different household makeup and size, access to disinfecting products, and improved access to medical care.\n\n[Clade I Monkeypox Outbreak Originating in Central Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html)\n\nOutbreaks of clade I monkeypox are occurring in Central and Eastern Africa\n\n[Clade II Monkeypox Outbreaks around the World](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html)\n\nInformation on the ongoing outbreak of clade II monkeypox\n\n### Across the globe\n\n- There are [outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in Central and Eastern Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html).\n  - Clade I has two subclades, clade Ia and clade Ib.\n  - In Central Africa, people have gotten clade Ia monkeypox through contact with infected dead or live wild animals, household transmission, or patient care; a high proportion of clade Ia cases have been reported in children younger than 15 years of age.\n  - More recently, subclade Ib has been identified in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo and has spread through intimate and adult sexual contact, including heterosexual spread with sex trade workers. Further spread outside of eastern DRC has occurred.\n  - Based on what we know now, clade Ib monkeypox has a lower case-fatality rate than clade Ia monkeypox.\n- Sustained and local person-to-person spread of clade I monkeypox has taken place in some non-endemic countries through sexual contact, day-to-day household contact, and within the healthcare setting in the absence of personal protective equipment.\n- As of September 15, 2025, the countries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia are experiencing **sustained** human-to-human transmission of the virus; there is also evidence of sustained transmission in Central African Republic and Republic of the Congo.\n- As of September 15, 2025, countries reporting travel-associated cases of clade I monkeypox since January 1, 2024, include Angola, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zimbabwe.\n- The [ongoing global outbreak of clade IIb](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) monkeypox has caused more than 100,000 cases in 122 total countries, including 115 countries where monkeypox was not previously reported.\n- Sierra Leone, Liberia, and other countries in West Africa are experiencing an outbreak of **clade II monkeypox**.\n  - Travelers to Sierra Leone and Liberia should review the [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), which includes information about the [monkeypox vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html) for eligible people.\n\n### Global case data\n\nFor global case data since January 1, 2024, see [2022-24 Monkeypox (Monkeypox) Outbreak: Global Trends (shinyapps.io)](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/#8_Disclaimers). Confirmed cases include those that are laboratory confirmed as monkeypox virus and may include cases only confirmed as _orthopoxvirus_. These data are provided for situational awareness and are subject to change.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n### In Africa\n\n- CDC continues critical work to protect the United States from emerging and infectious diseases. CDC has collaborated closely with key partners in affected countries to help support efforts to stop monkeypox at the source.\n- CDC and in-country partners across Africa have worked together on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity-building, strengthening local workforce capacity, case investigation, strengthening case management, infection prevention and control, and vaccine strategy and planning.\n- CDC collaborated with governmental and civil society partners in affected countries to collect and analyze case data, and to identify how monkeypox is spreading.\n- CDC trained 80 field epidemiologists in DRC and continues to provide key support for many who are still working in priority health zones. These CDC-trained epidemiologists are playing a key role in DRC efforts to detect cases, trace and monitor contacts, and increase community awareness of monkeypox, while also collecting and sending specimens to labs for testing, and training healthcare workers to do the same.\n\n- CDC is coordinating technical assistance in response to urgent needs identified by national governments and local partners in the areas of laboratory, surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, case management, infection prevention and control, psychosocial support, and vaccine planning.\n- The U.S. government is also working closely with several other countries in the region to assist with monitoring the situation as new information becomes available.\n\n- CDC's staff stationed in several countries affected by or on the border with countries with monkeypox cases provide critical information to inform U.S. preparedness efforts. Staff are connected to CDC's response efforts and can provide critical, real-time information to inform CDC's understanding of the outbreak, mitigate importation of cases into the U.S., and inform U.S. preparedness efforts.\n- Response efforts include increasing the number of monkeypox testing sites; improving specimen transport networks to quickly identify new cases; assisting with Ministry of Health-led vaccine implementation; strengthening emergency management systems; improving case surveillance; and training healthcare workers on infection prevention and control.\n\n\n### In the United States\n\n- CDC works closely with state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments to provide recommendations for clinical management, diagnosis, and prevention of monkeypox cases in the U.S.\n- CDC continually increases capacity in communities across the United States for early detection of monkeypox through existing surveillance systems, including [wastewater testing](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance/mpox-data.html).\n\n- CDC raises awareness for healthcare providers, including the latest guidance for [considering monkeypox](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) as a possible diagnosis in certain patients.\n- CDC has information and recommendations for members of the public, including those traveling to Central or Eastern Africa: [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-drc-neighboring-countries) and [Health Alert Network](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp) advisory.\n- CDC works with researchers and partner organizations to increase health equity around monkeypox and ensure that the populations most affected by monkeypox have access to the monkeypox vaccine.\n- CDC [conducts assessments](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to determine the risks of monkeypox to the people in the United States.\n\n## Resources\n\n- Get monkeypox and other vaccine recommendations when traveling to Central and Eastern Africa: [Destinations \\| Travelers' Health \\| CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)\n- [Clade II Monkeypox in Liberia and Sierra Leone -

It usually causes a mild illness with a contagious rash that lasts several weeks.\n\n- Mpox can spread person-to-person through close physical contact with someone who has mpox.\n\n- Protect yourself by getting\n[both doses of the mpox vaccine](http://go.cdph.ca.gov/mpoxvax) if you or your sex partner(s) may be at risk for mpox.​\n\n- Talk with your health care provider if you have mpox symptoms. They may recommend medicines to help your symptoms.​\n\n\n## Current situation​\n\n### ​Mpox in California\n\nThe current risk of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) to the general public remains low.\n\n- ​​Clade I mpox: Since 2024, there have been occasional travel-related cases\n[outside of central Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html)—including in California.  ​\n\n\n  - [As of October 2025, community spread of clade I mpox is happening in California. Enhanced public health monitoring is ongoing. Risk to the general public remains low​](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx).\n- ​Clade II mpox: Mpox has been spreading at low levels within California since 2022.  ​\n\n- The mpox vaccine is recommended for those who\n[may be at risk for mpox exposure​](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Vaccination.aspx?utm_source=non-clickable&utm_medium=vanity&utm_campaign=cdph-sexual-health). This includes before\n[traveling to areas where clade I mpox is spreading​](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html).\n\n\n### CDPH response\n\n- ​Since 2022, CDPH has worked closely with local health departments and community organizations. This has improved access to mpox vaccines, testing, and treatment for those at highest risk.\n\n- CDPH continues to work with local, state, and federal partners to monitor mpox and prevent outbreaks.\n\n- CDPH is working to help health care providers and the public become familiar with the symptoms and appearance of mpox.\n\n\n## Mpox basics\n\n### What is mpox and how do you get it?\n\nMpox is an infection caused by the monkeypox virus. There are\n[two types of mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html), clade I and clade II. Both types cause similar symptoms and can be prevented using the same methods.\n\nMpox mainly spreads through sex or close contact to a person who has mpox infection:\n\n- Sex (oral, anal, or vaginal)\n\n- ​​Intimate physical contact such as  cuddling or massages\n\n- Direct skin-to-skin contact with the rash, scabs, or body fluids that touched sores\n\n- Sharing a living space or personal items with someone who has mpox\n\n- Spread from a pregnant person with mpox to the fetus or baby\n\n\nCasual contact, like one might have in an airplane, office, or store, is unlikely to spread mpox.\n\n### What are the symptoms of mpox?\n\nAfter being exposed to mpox, it can take up to 21 days for symptoms to show. Mpox can start with symptoms such as:\n\n- Fever\n\n- Sore throat\n\n- Low energy\n\n- Swollen lymph nodes\n\n- Body aches\n\n\nWithin about 3 days, a rash or sore(s) develops.\n\n- ​It can\n[look like a pimple or blisters​](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/signs-symptoms/mpox-rash-photos.html) and may feel painful or itchy.\n\n- The rash or sore(s) may be located anywhere on the body. This includes the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus (butt).\n\n- The sores go through several stages, including scabs, before healing. It may leave scarring.\n\n\nSee a health care provider if you have these symptoms. ​\n\n### How do I avoid getting mpox?\n\n- ​Get vaccinated to protect yourself if you think you or your sex partners may be [at risk for mpox](http://go.cdph.ca.gov/mpoxvax). For the most protection, make sure you get both vaccine doses.\n\n- Talk to your sexual partner(s). Ask about recent illnesses, rashes, or recent international travel.\n\n\n  - ​Mpox symptoms may not be obvious or visible at the time of exposure.\n\n  - Having\n     [anonymous and/or multiple sex partners​](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/prevention/safer-sex-social-gatherings-and-mpox.html) may increase your risk.\n\n  - Condoms cannot always prevent mpox since the rash can occur on different parts of the body.\n\n\n- ​Do not share items with someone who has an unexplained rash. Avoid sharing items such as:\n\n\n  - ​Towels or bedding\n\n  - Sex toys or fetish gear\n\n  - Toothbrushes\n\n  - Dishware\n\n\n- ​Wash your hands often with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol). This is especially important after intimate contact.\n\n- Be mindful of mpox symptoms. If you notice any\n[new rashes or sore(s)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/signs-symptoms/index.html), avoid intimate contact until you can see a provider for testing.\n\n- Follow international travel recommendations. This may mean getting the\n[mpox vaccine](http://go.cdph.ca.gov/mpoxvax) if you are travelling to\n[regions where clade I mpox has been spreading](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html).\n\n\n### Who is most affected by mpox?\n\nTo date, most mpox infections in California have been among gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men and their social networks. Many infections have been associated with sexual or other intimate contact. Activities that may increase your risk of exposure to mpox include: ​\n\n- ​​Having more than one sex partner\n\n- Group or anonymous sex like at bathhouses or sex clubs\n\n- Having a sex partner who is at​ risk for mpox exposure\n\n- Traveling to a\n[country where clade I mpox is spreading​](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html)\n\n\nAlso, there have been travel-related clade I mpox infections in the U.S. and California. These infections have been among international travelers who were exposed while\n[traveling in a country where clade I mpox has been spreading](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html). Travel exposure risks may include:\n\n- ​​Intimate or sexual contact\n\n- Getting a massage\n\n- Visiting a home where someone is sick with mpox\n\n- Products or meat from wild animals that naturally carry mpox​\n\n\nBoth types of mpox can cause more severe illness in people who have certain health conditions, such as HIV. ​\n\n### ​I am sexually active. How can I protect myself and my partner(s)?\n\n- Not having sex or close contact if you or your partner(s) have mpox symptoms, such as a new or unexplained rash or sores or feels sick until they see a health care provider.\n\n- ​Reducing the number of sexual or close contact partners, especially if their recent sexual history is unknown.\n\n- Making a habit of exchanging contact info with any new partner for sexual health follow-up if needed.\n\n- Limiting going to sex or circuit parties or spaces with intimate contact with multiple people.\n\n- Using condoms and gloves during sexual activity:\n\n  - ​​Condoms (latex or polyurethane) may protect the mouth, penis, anus, or vagina from exposure to mpox; however, condoms alone may not prevent all exposures to mpox since the rash can occur on other parts of the body.\n\n  - Gloves (latex, polyurethane or nitrile) may reduce exposure if inserting fingers or hands into the anus or the vagina. The gloves must cover all exposed skin and be removed carefully to avoid touching the outer surface.\n\n  - Not sharing toothbrushes, towels, clothing, bedding, fetish gear, or sex toys.\n\n  - Washing hands and all gear, towels, bedding and sex toys thoroughly after use or sex act.\n\n### What if I get mpox?\n\n#### I think I was exposed\n\n- ​Get the mpox vaccine before symptoms develop. If you think you have been exposed to mpox and you haven’t already received both vaccine doses, getting the vaccine ASAP (within 14 days) may still provide some protection. ​ [Find mpox vaccine near you](http://go.cdph.ca.gov/mpoxvax).\n\n- ​Watch for symptoms. ​​Be alert for any new symptoms, which can feel like a cold or flu before the rash starts. Sometimes, sores develop in hard-to-see places like inside the mouth or rectum (butt).\n\n- ​​Consider avoiding close or intimate contact with others for 21 days after exposure.\n\n\n#### Testing and treatment ​\n\nSee your health care provide​r if you notice any rash or sores. Ask for mpox testing if you think you may have mpox.\n\n- ​The test for mpox is a swab of the rash or sore. Most primary care or urgent care clinics can do this testing if requested.\n\n- While uncommon, infections after vaccination are possible. And very rarely, people can get mpox more than once. These infections usually have more mild symptoms.\n\n\nTalk to your health care provider if you need help with your symptoms.\n\n- ​Most mpox infections heal with\n[self-care at home](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/caring/index.html#cdc_caring_for_yourself_and_others_providing_care-taking-care-of-yourself). Your provider may recommend medicines for your symptoms. ​\n\n- ​​It can take several weeks for the rash to fully heal.\n[Good skin care can promote healing of the rash​ (PDF)](https://assets.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/205qKUkE21zKDDSL3KBDq/46124bcc4bf0c0fabbe7a84a490efe73/AAD-Monkeypox-Caring-for-Skin.pdf). Avoid touching the rash or sores. This can cause them to spread more around your body or get infected.​\n\n- ​Additional treatments may be needed for people who are very sick with mpox or who are at a higher risk for getting very sick. Talk with your provider.\n\n\nPrevent spreading mpox to others.\n\n- ​ [Isolate from others](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/infection-control/at-home.html#cdc_generic_section_2-isolation-of-people-with-monkeypox) and pets at home until the rash is healed. If you must be around others, make sure all parts of the rash are covered with clothing, gloves, or bandages. Wear a face mask.\n\n- [Clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/caring/cleaning-and-disinfecting.html#cdc_caring_for_yourself_and_others_creating_a_care_plan-cleaning-and-disinfecting-at-home) shared areas in the home. The virus can survive for a while on linens, clothing and surfaces like doorknobs and faucet handles. Disinfection is recommended for all areas where you spent time. ​\n\n- [Notify close contacts](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/caring/index.html#cdc_caring_for_yourself_and_others_creating_a_care_plan-preventing-spread-to-others:~:text=Monkeypox%20While%20Traveling.-,Notifying%20close%20contacts,-If%20you%20have) who may have been exposed. ​​Your local health department can help with anonymous notifications.\n\n\nFor more information, see\n[What to Expect If You Are Diagnosed with Mpox](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox-Questions-and-Answers.aspx#What-to-Expect).\n\n## Resources for everyone\n\n- [​Mpox Vaccination: Find Vaccine Near You](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Vaccination.aspx)\n\n- [How Mpox Spreads (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/causes/index.html)\n\n- [How to Prevent Mpox (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/prevention/index.html)\n\n- [Signs and Symptoms of Mpox (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n- ​ [If You’re a Close Contact to Mpox (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/prevention/close-contact.html) ​\n\n- [What to Do If You Are Sick (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/caring/index.html)\n\n- [Preventing Mpox While Traveling (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/travel/index.html)\n\n\n## Resources for health care providers and public health\n\n- ​​See\n[CDPH Mpox Guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Guidance.aspx) ​ for resources. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n\n## How Can We Help You?\n\nConnect with CDPH for additional mpox resources.\n\nContact CDPH STD Control Branch Mpox Team\n\nIf you need further clarification or have questions, comments, and concerns regarding CDPH Mpox,\n[submit an inquiry​](mailto:mpoxadmin@cdph.ca.gov).\n\nContact Your Local Public Health Department\n\nReach out to your\n[local health department](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/LocalHealthServicesAndOffices.aspx) with any questions.​\n\nPage Last Updated : October 17, 2025\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\nTwitter Widget Iframe",

In early 2022, more than 40 countries reported Mpox outbreaks. As of 12 June 2024, the global case count for the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak was 97,281 confirmed cases, in 118 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 14 August 2024. Mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. The review also highlights Mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. The 2022 outbreak is also discussed in detail. The coinfection of HIV in patients infected with Mpox is also discussed. The evolving Mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. The discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against Mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. Although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering.\n\n**Keywords:** monkeypox (Mpox), pathology, complication, virus replication, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of Mpox\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nMonkeypox is a viral disease caused by the Mpox virus. According to the latest report (29 April 2025) of the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, 137,892 confirmed cases of Mpox have been reported from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2025. Out of these, 317 deaths were confirmed across 132 countries \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B1-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA with around 200 kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B2-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to 200 to 250 nm. This virus belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) and the family of _poxviridae_ \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B3-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. There are two clades of Mpox: clade I (formerly the Central African clade or the Congo Basin clade) and Clade II (formerly the West African clade). Both have a sequence similarity of about 95%. The fatality rate of clade I is three times higher than that of clade II \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B4-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox has a linear DNA genome that contains around 190 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B5-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats (ITR) \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B6-viruses-17-00753)\\]. All Mpox viruses have four ORFs in the ITR region \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B5-viruses-17-00753), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B7-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new Mpox. The ultrastructural analysis study in 2022 revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. The early mRNA and late mRNA form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. As a result, an intracellular mature virus (IMV) is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus (EMV), which is ready to infect another host cell \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B8-viruses-17-00753)\\] ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f001)). Mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the Mpox virus DNA was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in Italy and Germany in the 2022 global outbreak. Despite various studies on the Mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B9-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/a349ee514556/viruses-17-00753-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f001/)\n\nThe schematic representation of intracellular mature virus releasing in a host cell, the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) assemble and form mini nuclei in a host cell, and a large number of mitochondria are found near the mini nuclei. The replication of viral DNA occurs and forms m-RNA, which further forms viral protein, which is covered with an envelope and forms an intracellular mature virus.\n\nSince 2022, two major Mpox outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in July 2022 and again in August 2024. The initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly 100,000 cases and 200 fatalities \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B10-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. As of December 2024, this recent outbreak has seen over 55,000 reported or suspected cases and approximately 1000 deaths, primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring nations such as Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B11-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the UK, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, France, the USA, Canada, and Thailand. The details of the outbreaks of 2024 and 2022 are as follows.\n\n### 1.1. The 2024 Outbreak\n\nThe Mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the Sud Kivu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B12-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of Mpox. The genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) cytosine deaminase. This enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B13-viruses-17-00753)\\]. These genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade I variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact.\n\nGenetic changes, particularly those linked to APOBEC3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility.\n\nSince its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the DRC to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B14-viruses-17-00753), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo was the epicenter and reported 3235 Mpox infections and 19 deaths as of 11 August 2024 \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B16-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The emergence of the clade 1b Mpox in neighboring Central and East African countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. Burundi had recorded 545 Mpox alerts by 17 August 2024, and 142 were confirmed positive for the clade Ib Mpox variant. Rwanda confirmed its initial two Mpox infections on 24 July 2024, prompting the Ministry of Health to declare an outbreak on July 27. By 7 August 2024, Rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of Mpox, with no associated deaths. In Uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in June 2024, and out of those six, two were confirmed later. As of 13 August 2024, Kenya has identified 14 suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade Ib Mpox. To date, no deaths have been reported.\n\nIn August 2024, the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond Africa was confirmed for the first time \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The virus has also extended its reach to countries in East Africa, Europe, and Asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B16-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B17-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. On 22 August 2024, Thailand reported its initial Mpox case of a European man with a recent travel history to Africa \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B18-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Likewise, India’s identification of its first imported clade 1b Mpox case in Kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant.\n\nFrom November 2024 to 12 February 2025, four cases of clade Ib were detected. In the United States, the first confirmed case of clade Ib Mpox occurred in California in November 2024, following travel to an affected region. A second case was identified in Georgia on 14 January 2025, involving a traveler from a country with ongoing Mpox transmission. Subsequent cases were reported in New Hampshire on 7 February 2025 and in New York on 12 February 2025. These four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B19-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The 2024 outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA significant public health crisis unfolded between 2022 and 31 December 2024, with global records documenting over 118,777 Mpox infections \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Between 2022 and 2024, the different regions of the Americas documented 67,220 confirmed Mpox cases, resulting in 151 deaths across 31 countries and territories \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The majority of these cases occurred in 2022 (57,616, representing 85.7% of the total), followed by a substantial decline in 2023 (4056 cases, 6%). A minor increase was observed in 2024, with 5548 cases (8.3%) \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B21-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were East, Central, West, and Southern Africa, specifically, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, the Central African Republic (CAR), Ivory Coast, and South Africa \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B22-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics.\n\n### 1.2. The 2022 Outbreak\n\nBefore 2022, Mpox cases were documented within the African continent. The first case of the 2022 outbreak of the Mpox outside the African continent was recorded on 6 May 2022 in the United Kingdom \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B23-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A total of 366 Mpox cases were confirmed in the United Kingdom (UK) until 10 June 2022 \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B24-viruses-17-00753), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B25-viruses-17-00753)\\]. On 18 May 2022, Portugal reported 14 Mpox infections, Spain reported seven, and Canada reported 13. The first Mpox cases in Belgium, Sweden, and Italy were confirmed on 19 May 2022. France, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands each reported their initial Mpox cases on 20 May 2022. Switzerland and Israel each confirmed their initial Mpox cases on May 21. By 24 May 2022, 19 countries had reported cases of Mpox. Among these, the United Arab Emirates identified its first case in late May, involving a 29-year-old female traveler from West Africa. Slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. Denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the Canary Islands. In Canada, Quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on 24 May, the same day the Czech Republic confirmed its first case \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B24-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study published in the New England Journal on 21 July 2022 reported a total of 528 Mpox infections between 27 April and 24 June 2022, at 43 sites within 16 countries \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nBy 27 May 2022, Portugal had confirmed 96 Mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all 96 cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. A subset of 27 confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in Eurosurveillance in June 2022 \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B27-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The majority of cases (25 cases) of the 2022 Portugal outbreak resided in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) region, with single cases in the North and Algarve regions. All cases were male, ages ranging from 22 to 51 years (majority 30–39). Considering exposures within the 21 days preceding symptom onset, few (1/10) reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel (4/27).\n\nMost cases were identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) (18/19), while one reported sex with only women. During the 21 days before symptom onset, most cases with available data (14/16) reported multiple sexual partners. Six cases reported attending a sauna in the LVT region, one frequented a UK sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals (two with cats and one with pigs). Common symptoms included exanthema (fourteen), inguinal lymphadenopathy (fourteen), fever (thirteen), and genital ulcers (six). Fourteen cases were HIV-positive. Three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. No deaths were reported by 27 May 2022. One middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B27-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency for a previous Mpox outbreak caused by clade IIb of the virus. Almost 48 cases of Mpox were reported from different regions of Latin America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, by 28 June 2022 \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B28-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In July 2022, the multi-country Mpox outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. This declaration was lifted in May 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. The outbreak had infected 87,000 people and resulted in 140 deaths. The WHO attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B29-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 7 February 2024, the maximum number of reported cases in the USA is 31,894, followed by Brazil (10,967), Spain (7752), and France (4171).\n\nThe geographical distribution of the Mpox in countries affected in Africa is illustrated in [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f002) a, while the recent trends of Mpox cases in Africa are shown in [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f002) b.\n\n#### Figure 2.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/d209b4abd20e/viruses-17-00753-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f002/)\n\n( **a**) Shows the geographical distribution of Mpox in countries affected in Africa.

The data shown here include laboratory-confirmed cases only. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a small number of cases are not represented on the epidemic curves due to missing data. Brackets at the end of the curve indicate potential reporting delays in recent weeks of data. Figure and data source: WHO.\n\n## 2\\. Host Reservoirs and Transmission\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease; Central African rodents and primates are the natural hosts of Mpox. The Mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B30-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Transmission can also occur via contaminated materials (fomites) like bedding or clothing. Historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent.\n\nA 2018 case study reported that a man traveling from Nigeria to the UK on September 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with Mpox. One of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had 134 contacts traced and monitored. Four of these contacts later became ill. This incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of Mpox from a traveler returning from Nigeria to healthcare staff \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B31-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nHistorically, Mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. However, the transmission pattern shifted in the 2022 outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. Over the last two years (2020–22), predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B32-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because Mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. Human-to-human transmission of the Mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B33-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe Mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B34-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The different proposed model admits that during the entry of the Mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the Mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. In the same way, when the Mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and Langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. In this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f003)).\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n[![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/fd6ca55b0628/viruses-17-00753-g003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f003/)\n\nA schematic diagram of the Mpox virus and its entry route in humans was created by biorender.com.

Complications Associated with Mpox\n\nThe various complications that have been observed in Mpox-infected persons are the following.\n\n### 3.1. Neurological and Psychiatric Complications\n\nMpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. Research conducted in Nigeria in 2020 indicated that a quarter of hospitalized Mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B35-viruses-17-00753)\\]. However, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. Neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in Mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak, with reported occurrences of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2%, respectively \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B36-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed the presence of Mpox-specific IgM antibodies. Studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in 50% of individuals with Mpox infection. Badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B36-viruses-17-00753)\\]. These symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B37-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, research conducted in Iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing Mpox outbreak \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B38-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country Mpox outbreak within the Kurdistan region of Iraq. A digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from 27 to 30 July 2022. The study included 510 participants. Overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of Mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. Statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. Gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward Mpox \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B38-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.2. Dermatological Complications\n\nA common characteristic of Mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. Skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat (macular), then raised (popular), and subsequently fluid-filled (vesicular). These lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B39-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A characteristic Mpox rash begins with small, flat (macules) or raised (papules) lesions, typically 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. These lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression (umbilication), and eventually form crusts. The vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B40-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA hallmark of Mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B41-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. However, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. Lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. The rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward (centrifugally) to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. A higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B42-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. A comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of Mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B43-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn one study of 54 patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority (94%) exhibiting anogenital involvement \\[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B44-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A large portion of these patients (89%) reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage (7%) had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. Additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue (67%) and fever (57%), while a minority (18%) showed no initial symptoms. In some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B45-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA separate international study, tracking 528 Mpox infections in 2022, also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. This study found that 73% of patients had anogenital lesions, and 41% presented with mucosal lesions. A rash was observed in 95% of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever (62%), lymphadenopathy (56%), lethargy (41%), muscle aches (31%), and headaches (27% \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\]). Due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of Mpox, especially as seen in the 2022 outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected Mpox infection.\n\nThe other study, conducted in 101 patients from thirteen countries, shows that 54% of cases have been found with skin lesions. During the initial five days of infection, papules (36%), vesicles (17%), and pustules (20%) were the most frequently observed skin lesions. From days 6–10, pustules became the dominant lesion (36%), followed by erosions/ulcers (27%) and crusts/scabs (24%). After day 11, crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B46-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nWhile monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B47-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.3. Complications Related to the Coinfection of Mpox Virus and HIV\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of Mpox. Mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The coinfection of Mpox virus and HIV was first identified and diagnosed in Latin America \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B48-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In 2022, the recent coinfection of Mpox and acute HIV was also confirmed in a 24-year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B49-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A 2023 review in _Vaccine_ reported 6345 confirmed Mpox cases across 53 studies, with a 40.32% HIV co-infection rate \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B50-viruses-17-00753)\\]. According to WHO, 51% (13,769/26,992) of confirmed cases of Mpox have HIV \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B51-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The outbreak of Mpox in multiple countries was reported during 2022–24. According to the WHO report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the European region (86%), followed by America (11%), the African region (2%), and the Eastern Mediterranean region (1%) \\[ [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B52-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Co-infection with HIV increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of HIV on genital organs (lesions) and genital secretions or by increasing both factors \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B53-viruses-17-00753), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B54-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Individuals living with HIV, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low CD4 cell counts (<500 cells per mm3), demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe Mpox complications and mortality compared to those without HIV. The immunodeficiency resulting from advanced HIV infection elevates the susceptibility to severe Mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B55-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThis study analysed 382 Mpox cases, comprising 367 cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. The median age of the participants was 35 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 30 to 43 years. At the time of Mpox diagnosis, 349 individuals (91%) were known to be living with HIV. Among those with HIV, 228 (65%) were adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in 32 participants (8%). The median CD4 cell count was 211 cells/mm3 (IQR 117–291). Specifically, 85 individuals (22%) had CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, and 94 individuals (25%) had counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3. An undetectable viral load was present in 193 participants (51%) \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B55-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nSevere Mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding 300 cells/mm3. These complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions (54% vs. 7%), pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules (29% vs. 0%), and secondary infections and sepsis (44% vs. 9%).\n\nHospitalization was required for 107 participants (28%), with 27 (25%) of those hospitalized resulting in death. All fatalities occurred in individuals with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. Within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated HIV viral loads. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to Mpox was suspected in 21 of the 85 individuals (25%) who initiated or restarted ART, with 12 (57%) of these cases resulting in death. Tecovirimat was administered to 62 participants (16%), while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants (2%). Tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases.\n\n### 3.4. Complications Associated with Heart (Myocarditis)\n\nMyocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in Mpox infection. Two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the U.S. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. They were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms (Chest pain) and elevated biomarkers. Oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. They received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels \\[ [56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B56-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a 2022 study, Thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. One of these patients had a history of HIV with a normal CD4 count \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as Coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses \\[ [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B57-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. The most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing 10 to 14 days after the viral infection. The occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines \\[ [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B58-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. Heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in Mpox infection \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B59-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.5. Hypotension Sepsis Complication\n\nIn severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. The associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. These factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. Vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement.\n\nWhile infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in Mpox-infected patients with _Streptococcus pyogenes_ \\[ [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B60-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. Treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support \\[ [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B61-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.6. Ocular Complication\n\nOcular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B3-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. The 2022 Mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, compared to 9–23% in prior outbreaks \\[ [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B62-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. Less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. In the 2022 outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. Though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, significantly lower than the 9–23% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions \\[ [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B62-viruses-17-00753), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B63-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with Mpox \\[ [64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B64-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, there are documented cases (53-year-old patient in San Francisco, CA, USA) where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions \\[ [65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B65-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nPatients presenting with ocular Mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. A slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures \\[ [66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B66-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nRetinol supplementation is advised. Supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. In cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary \\[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B67-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use \\[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B68-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management.\n\n### 3.7. Fulminant Mpox\n\nA severe, widespread, and destructive form of Mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/µL, high HIV viral loads, or hepatitis B co-infection. These cases show a resemblance to an AIDS-defining illness. Patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged \\[ [69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B69-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. Complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B70-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis \\[ [71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B71-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mortality was reported in 15% of patients, primarily those with CD4 counts below 200 cells/µL \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B70-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. Tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. Prolonged treatment may be necessary. Wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. Specialist consultation should be considered as needed. Close monitoring for complications is vital \\[ [72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B72-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.8. Complications Associated with Immune System\n\nLike COVID-19 infection, Mpox also creates cytokines inside the body \\[ [73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B73-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Cytokines are Th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins (IL-4, IL5, IL6, and IL10) are released, while TH1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. Therefore, IFγ (interferon gamma), IL2, IL12, TNF-α, and IFN-α levels decreased after Mpox infection \\[ [74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B74-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The human Mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. It downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. The nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification \\[ [75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B75-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. The intracellular protein of Mpox called Viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B33-viruses-17-00753), [76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B76-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in [Figure 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f004). The Mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons (IFNs) \\[ [77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B77-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. There are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNω are considered type I interferons. Type I interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating Janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway \\[ [78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B78-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: (a) An in vitro study in 2010 showed that Mpox viral protein B16 inhibits JAK-STAT induced by type I interferon \\[ [79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B79-viruses-17-00753)\\]. (b) Another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of D7L block interleukin (IL-18) \\[ [80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B80-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The complement control protein (CCP) of Mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense \\[ [81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B81-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Apart from it, many proteins of Mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, IL-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, SPI-1, inhibitors of MHC class I molecules, inhibitors of IRF3 NF-kB activation, Inhibitor of IRF3 and IRF7 activation, inhibitors of MHC class II, CC, and CXC chemokine binding proteins.\n\n#### Figure 4.\n\n[![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/4ace5344de38/viruses-17-00753-g004.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g004.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f004/)\n\nThe schematic diagram shows an Mpox-infected liver and testis and its evading mechanism in host cells with cytokine storm production, representing increased Th2-mediated immune response and decreased TH1-mediated immune response.\n\n## 4\\. Diagnosis of Mpox\n\nPCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of Mpox viral DNA in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. Real-time PCR is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of Mpox. In the 2022–23 outbreak of Mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: The Novaplex MPXV Assay, the STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX, the Real Cycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2, and the RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0, with an in-house PCR assay. A comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the Novaplex MPXV Assay and RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0. The RealCycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2 and STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy (97.3%) and diagnostic sensitivity (96.3%) \\[ [82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B82-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. Cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination \\[ [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B83-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques (immunofluorescence technique and ELISA), electron microscopy-based detection (TEM), radiation-based virus detection (X-ray diffraction technique and CT), nucleic acid amplification methods (NASBA, LAMP, RT-PCR), antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses (HAI), and CRISPR-CAS system-based detection \\[ [84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B84-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic \\[ [85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B85-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nCRISPR-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. According to research conducted \\[ [86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B86-viruses-17-00753)\\], a system was designed to detect the Mpox viral DNA using a fluorescence readout. In this study, it was shown that the G-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target DNA, which was labeled with fluorescein (6-FAM) on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher (BHQ-1) at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the CAS-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. This effect was not shown in the absence of the target DNA because CAS-12a is unable to cleave the labeled G-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens.\n\nPan-orthopoxvirus PCR/ESI-MS is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the T5000 platform \\[ [87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B87-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Here, A PCR method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) was employed to diagnose Mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples.\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to RT-PCR. This technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of DNA synthesis by Bst DNA polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle \\[ [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B88-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n## 5\\. Treatment of Mpox\n\nThe treatment of Mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with Mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. Other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. Vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. To prevent infection with the Mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials (e.g., clothing, bedding). Most people with Mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. Severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women.\n\n### 5.1. Vaccine Strategies Against Mpox\n\nAlmost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since April 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. Viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of Mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation.\n\nAccording to Batéjat Christophe et al., the Mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named FCS and VTM and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. This study showed that Mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °C and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °C, and there was no difference between clade I and clade II \\[ [89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B89-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe United States of America currently has three vaccines against smallpox: JYNNEOSTM, also known as IMVAMUNE, ACAM2000®, and Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) \\[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B90-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This vaccine JYNNEOSTM has been prepared from the modified Ortho poxvirus vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating.\n\nIn August 2007, the FDA approved ACAM2000® for the prevention of smallpox. The ACAM2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with JYNNEOS™. ACAM2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas JYNNEOS™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus. ACAM2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but JYNNEOS™ does not show cutaneous reactions. Under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV) can be used, but its effectiveness against Mpox is still unknown \\[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B90-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the use of the JYNNEOS™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and Mpox \\[ [91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B91-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Originally, the FDA developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series (0.5 mL per dose, administered 4 weeks apart). However, due to overwhelming demand, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on 9 August 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series (0.1 mL per dose, administered four weeks apart).\n\nIt was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted VE of 88.9% (95% CL, 56.0 to 97.2), 80.3% (95% CL, 22.9 to 95.0), and 86.9% (95% CL, 69.1 to 94.5), respectively. These vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from Mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of Mpox. These vaccines (JYNNEOS™) are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by Mpox, such as gay, bisexual, MSM, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and HIV patients \\[ [92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B92-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nHuber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from Mpox and others with MSM (men who have sex with another man), aged 18–49. A total of 309 infected patients (Mpox or MSM) were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency (VE) was 75.2% (95% confidence interval (CL) 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose (partial vaccination) of vaccine and 85.9% (95% CL, 73.8 to 92.4) in patients with full (two doses) vaccination \\[ [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B93-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nLauren Pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation Mpox vaccines (MVA-BN, LC16m8, OrthopoxVac) in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population \\[ [94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B94-viruses-17-00753)\\]. They compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. Additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses (one or two) and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). A comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. Thirty-three studies focused on third-generation Mpox vaccines, predominantly MVA-BN (32 studies). Two additional studies reanalysed existing data. The majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between May and October 2022.\n\nVaccine efficacy for a single dose of MVA-BN was estimated at 76% (95% CI: 64–88%) across twelve studies. For two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% (95% CI: 72–92%) based on six studies. Regarding post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with MVA-BN, the vaccine efficacy against Mpox was 20% (95% CI: -24–65%) from seven studies. All vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nIn terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 (55%) were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 (9%) as fair, and 12 out of 33 (36%) as good. Notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 (69%) rated as good.\n\n### 5.2. Various Therapies for the Management of Mpox\n\n#### 5.2.1. Tecovirimat\n\nTecovirimat (TPOXX, ST-246) is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but under the Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol, it can also be used to treat Mpox. In the United States or Canada, Tecovirimat is not approved for use against Mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in Europe for the treatment of Mpox \\[ [95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B95-viruses-17-00753), [96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B96-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear.\n\nTecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against Mpox and other smallpox viruses. Tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus F13L protein. This protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread. Tecovirimat functions by acting as a molecular binder, promoting the dimerization of F13L and thereby inhibiting its normal activity \\[ [97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B97-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nEarly studies have indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly shorten the duration of monkeypox skin lesions \\[ [98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B98-viruses-17-00753), [99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B99-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Initial findings from the STOMP trial, which spanned multiple countries, failed to demonstrate a notable impact of tecovirimat on the healing time of skin and mucosal lesions in individuals with mild to moderate monkeypox. Notably, in the STOMP trial, a majority of participants began tecovirimat treatment more than five days after experiencing initial symptoms \\[ [100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B100-viruses-17-00753)\\]. According to another study \\[ [101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B101-viruses-17-00753)\\], tecovirimat, which inhibits the formation of p37 (a protein that helps in the release of enveloped virus and also enhances the virulence factor), was found to be effective in treating Mpox.\n\nTecovirimat is an inhibitor of the pox virus; however, Mpox also shows resistance against many drugs in cell culture, including CMX001 and ST-246 \\[ [102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B102-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The clinical study of Mpox was done in France in 2022, where Mpox was isolated and sequenced. This study reveals that the effective concentration of tecovirimat against Mpox is in nanomolar concentrations, while cidofovir is only effective at micromolar concentrations \\[ [103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B103-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Therefore, combination therapy may be effective for the treatment of Mpox.\n\nThe efficacy of tecovirimat has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo against a clade 2 Canadian 2022 isolate of Mpox isolated during the 2022 outbreak, and it was found that tecovirimat prevented Mpox replication in vitro with an effective concentration in the nanomolar range. The efficacy of tecovirimat was also evaluated in the CAST/EiJ mouse model with the 2022 Canadian isolate. The experiments also show that tecovirimat reduced viral titers after 1–2 weeks of infection. In 2022, tecovirimat was recommended against Mpox treatment. In vitro testing has been performed against 2022 Canadian isolates of Mpox designated Mpox/SP2833. The EC50 and EC90, for TPOXX were determined against Mpox/SP2833, a clade 1 virus in Vero E6 cells is 0.008 ± 0.0014 (EC50 value (μM) ± SE) and 0.0145 ± 0.0138 (EC90 value (μM) ± SE) \\[ [104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B104-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a recent study published in the Lancet journal in 2025, the author conducted an in vitro analysis comparing the susceptibility of clades 1b and 2b to tecovirimat. The clade 1b isolate was obtained in Sweden in August 2024 from a traveler returning from Africa. For comparison, the clade 2b virus was isolated in France in June 2022 from a patient at the Institut Pasteur Medical Center. Additionally, ancestral clades 1a and 2a were included as controls, utilizing U2OS cells, known for their high sensitivity to Mpox virus infection, as target cells. The findings demonstrated that tecovirimat effectively suppressed all four viral strains, exhibiting comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 15.3 nM to 25.8 Nm \\[ [105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B105-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n#### 5.2.2. Cidofovir and Brincidofovir\n\nBrincidofovir and cidofovir are also being used as DNA polymerase inhibitors for Mpox treatment, despite not being approved by the FDA. In vitro and in vivo studies reported that both cidofovir and brincidofovir can stop the replication of Mpox \\[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B106-viruses-17-00753)\\]. When Brin cidofovir derivative (CMX001) is given to the host, the lipid part of the drug breaks down and releases cidofovir, which forms cidofovir-diphosphate after phosphorylation, which inhibits DNA polymerase \\[ [107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B107-viruses-17-00753), [108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B108-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a 2020 study, another new drug was reported, which is Nioch-14, having antiviral activity against Mpox \\[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B106-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n#### 5.2.3. Resveratrol\n\nA recent study indicated that resveratrol plays an important role in Mpox treatment. Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, pines, and berries \\[ [109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B109-viruses-17-00753), [110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B110-viruses-17-00753)\\]. It is also available in red and white wines, but a higher concentration is found in red wine. The maximum amount of resveratrol is found in Polygonum cuspidatum (524 μg/g). It is also known as Japanese knotweed, which has been extensively used for inflammatory treatments in 2012–13. Resveratrol is found in cis and trans forms, but the trans form is highly effective in anti-inflammatory activity. The antiviral effects of resveratrol have been explored in several viruses, including the Mpox virus, the influenza A virus \\[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B111-viruses-17-00753)\\] Epstein–Barr virus \\[ [112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B112-viruses-17-00753)\\], Herpes simplex virus \\[ [113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B113-viruses-17-00753)\\], HIV \\[ [114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B114-viruses-17-00753)\\], and hepatitis C virus \\[ [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B115-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nResveratrol inhibits the replication of many viruses \\[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B111-viruses-17-00753), [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B115-viruses-17-00753), [116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B116-viruses-17-00753), [117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B117-viruses-17-00753), [118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B118-viruses-17-00753), [119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B119-viruses-17-00753), [120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B120-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The antiviral mechanisms of resveratrol against various types of viruses are different. Resveratrol reduced the virus yield by more than 120-fold at a concentration of 50 mM. The effect of resveratrol against Mpox has also been examined using HeLa cells. HeLa cells were infected with two strains of Mpox virus, Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC, and it was found that resveratrol at 50 mM concentration reduced the yield of Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC Clades by 195- and 38-fold, respectively \\[ [121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B121-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nApart from these potential therapies, some other alternative treatments such as TOP1 inhibitor, chlorhexidine, and cysteine proteinase inhibitors are being explored, but more investigation is required for the effective treatment of these compounds.\n\n#### 5.2.4. Plant Metabolite as a Therapeutic Drug\n\nA recent study was conducted in 2023, in which the anti-monkeypox capability was evaluated in 56 plant products. Among these metabolites, curcumin showed the strongest binding affinity with a value of −37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin (−34.89 kcal/mol), piperine (−34.58 kcal/mol), and coumadin (−34.14 kcal/mol) \\[ [122](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B122-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study that occurred in 2022 shows various natural compounds obtained from Plantago lanceolate targeting on profilin-like protein A42R of Mpox virus \\[ [123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B123-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The A42R protein of Mpox has an amino acid sequence similarity with profilin proteins of eukaryotic cells \\[ [124](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B124-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Profilin family proteins are actin-binding proteins responsible for F-actin assembly in the actin filament and also participate in the regulation of F-actin \\[ [125](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B125-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Silico-based screening identified various important compounds, such as luteolin 7,30-diglucuronide, luteolin 7-glucuronide-30-glucoside, plantagoside, narcissoside, and others \\[ [123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B123-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis revealed that plantagoside and narcissoside were found to be more stable products that were able to bind with the binding pocket of the viral protein of the Mpox virus due to hydrophobic and hydrogen interactions.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMpox, while historically less prevalent than other orthopoxviruses, has demonstrated a significant emergence for globally, highlighting the importance of robust surveillance and preparedness. Its complications, while often self-limiting, can be severe, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. Transmission, primarily through close contact, necessitates stringent public health measures to curtail outbreaks. Accurate and timely diagnosis, facilitated by PCR testing, is crucial for effective management and containment. While specific antiviral treatments are available, their accessibility and widespread use remain limited, emphasizing the need for further research and development. Effective public health strategies, including vaccination and education, are essential in mitigating the impact of Mpox and preventing future pandemics. Continued research into the virus’s evolving epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and optimal treatment strategies is imperative to safeguard global health.\n\nThe 2019 coronavirus pandemic demonstrated that disease outbreaks extend beyond physical illness, significantly affecting mental well-being. Individuals experienced heightened fear, including anxiety about potential loss and depression linked to isolation. Healthcare workers facing direct exposure reported particularly elevated levels of fear. Parallels can be drawn with the Mpox outbreak, which has also been associated with notable economic and behavioral shifts, manifesting in increased anger, frustration, depression, and anxiety.\n\nThe health care provider also has very little knowledge regarding the treatment of Mpox, so proper guidance and care of Mpox-affected people should be done for the management of mental health issues in COVID-19-affected people, WHO issued advisories that may be implemented in Mpox cases.\n\nThe important suggestions to control mental disorders during the monkeypox outbreak are as follows: (a) Always study and gain knowledge from an authorized source, such as WHO. (b) Do not come under the influence of people who are already suffering from any mental disorder because of an outbreak. (c) Avoid drinking alcohol or smoking during an outbreak because it will only ruin your health condition. (d) Hand hygiene practices should be followed regularly. (e) Eat a well-balanced diet, and try to avoid sitting alone. Even when you are alone in the house, try to chat with your friends or family members via social media. (f) Exercise daily.\n\nThe outbreaks in 2022 across the globe have emphasized the significance of continuous and focused intensive care, along with the development of novel drugs.\n\nThe limited smallpox vaccine administration and decreasing immunity in the population can enhance virus spreading globally. Patients of Mpox have different kinds of complications, such as bacterial infection of the skin, skin scarring, permanent corneal scarring, pneumonia, dehydration, sepsis, and encephalitis. It is imperative to provide comprehensive care for patients, including education, nutritional support, hydration, and protection of sensitive organs such as the eyes and genitals. Therefore, it is important for the medical professional team, including clinicians, health experts, and nurses, to immediately identify infection in humans and animals, use protective measures, and initiate public health reporting to prevent an outbreak.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sharda University and Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) for providing valuable resources for this work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization and original draft preparation: R.Y., U.S. and S.K.; writing: R.Y., U.S., S.G., H.A.R., A.A.C., S.R. and V.K.K.; review and editing: H.A.R., A.A.C. and S.R.; supervision: S.K., V.K.K. and R.Y.

Ocean Blvd,\n\nLong Beach, CA 90802\n\n[www.longbeach.gov](https://www.longbeach.gov/link/a351f9c91c374c7c9d5b3724eb630cd0.aspx \"Longbeach.gov Homepage\")\n\n10/14/2025\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEPress Release # 101425-2\n\nSubject:\n\nCity of Long Beach Confirms First Case of Clade I Mpox\n\nFirst Case in United States Without Known International Travel\n\nContact:\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Public Affairs Office\n\nHE-PublicAffairs@longbeach.gov\n\nLong Beach, CA – The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services ( [Health Department](http://longbeach.gov/health)), in coordination with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), has confirmed a case of clade I mpox (previously known as monkeypox) in a Long Beach resident with no recent travel history. This is the first case of clade I mpox in Long Beach, the seventh case nationally and the first without known travel. The person required hospitalization and is now isolating and recovering at home.\n\nThe risk to the public remains low and the Health Department is conducting a thorough public health investigation, including a review of the person’s potential sources of exposure such as social and travel history, and is implementing contact tracing procedures. At this time, no additional cases of clade I mpox have been identified in Long Beach.The City is working closely with health officials at CDPH and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the situation, educate health care providers and the community and determine whether there are additional cases in Long Beach and surrounding areas.\n\n“While the overall risk of mpox clade I exposure to the public remains low, we are taking this very seriously and ensuring our community and health care partners remain vigilant so we can prevent any more cases,” said Mayor Rex Richardson. “This underscores the importance of continued surveillance, early response and vaccination.”\n\nClade I mpox is a strain historically associated with more severe illness and has been primarily identified in Central and Eastern Africa. This strain differs from clade II, which was linked to the 2022–23 outbreak in the United States and typically causes milder disease. Symptoms may include rash or lesions, fever, chills, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes and body aches.\n\nMpox can spread through specific behaviors, regardless of a person’s race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity or sexual orientation. It is spread through direct contact with infectious sores or body fluids, sexual or intimate contact (e.g. hugging, cuddling or kissing), and touching contaminated items such as bedding or clothes. Anyone who develops an unexplained rash or lesions should avoid sex and intimate contact and seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Most people recover within 2-4 weeks, but antiviral treatments may be considered for individuals with or at risk of developing severe illness.\n\nWhile the risk to the public remains low, [CDPH recommends](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Mpox/Mpox-Vaccination.aspx) vaccination for people who may be at increased risk of exposure. This includes people who are gay or bisexual and men who have sex with men, transgender and non-binary people, people who are immunocompromised (e.g. those with HIV), someone who was exposed to a person with mpox, those with occupational exposure, and people planning to travel to areas with ongoing mpox outbreaks. The available vaccine, JYNNEOS, provides protection against both clade I and clade II mpox. Currently, people who have completed the two-dose series are not recommended to receive a booster.\n\nVaccines are available through local pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens. Residents are encouraged to call ahead to confirm JYNNEOS availability or use the statewide mpox vaccine locator at [EmpoweredAgainstMpox.com](https://www.empoweredagainstmpox.com/) to find a provider.\n\n“We are working with state and federal partners to identify the source, notify potential contacts and provide access to testing and vaccination,” said Dr. Cliff Okada, Long Beach Public Health Physician. “Anyone with an unexplained rash or lesions should seek care promptly. Speak openly with intimate partners and your healthcare provider. Early action protects you and others.”\n\nIn 2025, there have been seven mpox cases reported in Long Beach, including the recent clade I mpox case. The clade I classification was confirmed through testing conducted by CDPH, with additional testing underway in coordination with the CDC.\n\nResidents may call the Long Beach Health Department’s HIV/STI resource line at (562) 570-4321 for guidance related to vaccination, symptoms or reporting concerns.\n\nFor more information about mpox, visit [longbeach.gov/mpox](https://longbeach.gov/mpox).

Photograph: Jeenah Moon/AP\n\n# Three cases of severe mpox reported in California, health officials say\n\nUnrelated cases mark first time clade I of disease formerly known as monkeypox has spread within US, officials say\n\nThree [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california) residents have been infected with clade I [mpox](https://www.theguardian.com/world/monkeypox), a more severe strain of the virus formerly known as monkeypox – marking the first time this type of mpox has spread within the US, health officials said on Friday.\n\nThe unrelated cases, identified in Long Beach and Los Angeles county, involve patients who had not recently traveled abroad. All three were hospitalized and are now recovering, according to the [California department of public health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx).\n\nMpox is a viral infection that often begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills and muscle aches. These are usually followed by a rash that starts as small raised spots, then develop into fluid-filled blisters before forming scabs.\n\nThe virus has two main genetic groups, or “clades”. Clade I mpox has caused widespread disease and deaths in parts of central and east Africa, most acutely in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clade II was the strain behind the 2022 US outbreak, which has circulated at low levels since.\n\n“The presence of clade I needs careful evaluation,” said Seth Blumberg, an associate professor of medicine at the University of [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california), San Francisco’s division of infectious diseases and hospital medicine.\n\n“I don’t think the historical results we’ve seen from Africa are directly translatable, but we need to monitor these cases closely.”\n\nDr Rita Nguyen, assistant state public health officer, said in Friday’s statement that “clade I mpox cases can be severe” and the “risk of severe disease and hospitalization are highest for people with weakened immune systems.”\n\n“It’s critical to protect yourself by getting both doses of the mpox vaccine if you or your sex partner(s) may be at risk for mpox,” she said.\n\nAnyone can contract mpox through close physical contact, including sex. Past outbreaks of clade II [primarily affected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/05/lgbt-groups-unite-to-urge-uk-ministers-to-act-against-monkeypox) gay and bisexual men and transgender or non-binary people who have sex with men. California’s public health department now believes person-to-person spread of clade I is occurring in California, mainly affecting these communities.\n\nIn Long Beach, officials [announced the first case](https://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/city-of-long-beach-confirms-first-case-of-clade-i-mpox/) on Tuesday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported [six prior US clade I cases](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html), all linked to travel abroad. The first was detected in San Mateo county in 2024. Officials said the overall risk to the public remains low, and casual contact in settings like offices or public transit is unlikely to spread the virus.\n\nThe Jynneos vaccine protects against both clade I and II mpox. It is a two-dose series given a month apart, with full immunity reached two weeks after the second dose. No booster is currently recommended.\n\nVaccination doesn’t completely eliminate the risk of contracting mpox, but experts say it helps reduce severity if a person were to contract the disease.\n\n“The vaccines are completely protective,” Blumberg said. “Vaccines can prevent the severity of disease. If you were to get mpox, you would be less likely to need advanced care.”\n\nThe CDC said it is not known how long vaccine protection might last, or if protection might decrease over time, according to its [website](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html). The public health agency is analyzing the current data and conducting studies to better understand how the Jynneos vaccine works amid the current mpox outbreak, as well as how long protection might last.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n- [US news](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news)\n- [Mpox](https://www.theguardian.com/world/monkeypox)\n- [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california)\n- [Health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/health)\n- [Vaccines and immunisation](https://www.theguardian.com/society/vaccines)\n- [Infectious diseases](https://www.theguardian.com/science/infectiousdiseases)\n- [West Coast](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-coast)\n- [news](https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news)\n\nShare\n\n[Reuse this content](https://syndication.theguardian.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2025%2Foct%2F20%2Fthree-cases-severe-mpox-california&type=article&internalpagecode=us-news/2025/oct/20/three-cases-severe-mpox-california \"Reuse this content\")\n\n### Most viewed\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f303c11d0c0b427013783889f7a638321f13965a/650_0_6498_5199/master/6498.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Epstein emails: key takeaways from 20,000 pages of newly released files**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/epstein-files-key-takeaways)\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57a4486d762c962e1d1432faa5c39169d0249b5d/294_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Donald Trump and JD Vance have graphic sex (in South Park)**](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/13/south-park-donald-trump-jd-vance-graphic-sex)\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47909bbb85dd00c1dd01d691ba583e590889572f/281_0_4524_3621/master/4524.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Donald Trump to pardon UK billionaire and former Tottenham owner Joe Lewis**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/trump-to-pardon-british-billionaire-and-former-tottenham-owner-joe-lewis)\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ca47c139576188f8dfc65de1e6317665db2872e/322_0_3190_2551/master/3190.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**Florida air force base orders residents to take down Christmas decor**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/florida-air-force-base-christmas-decorations)\n\n- [![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73fcddb6c35b34f8730eebc91064e1a39732aa0e/229_170_4215_3372/master/4215.jpg?width=75&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\\\\\n\\\\\n**It soothes my bitter heart to know that no matter how much money Elon Musk has, he will never, ever be funnyRebecca Shaw**](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/13/it-soothes-my-bitter-heart-to-know-that-no-matter-how-much-money-elon-musk-has-he-will-never-ever-be-funny)\n\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\nPrivacy Manager US App\n\nX\n\nCalifornia residents have certain rights with regard to the sale of personal information to third parties. Guardian News and Media and our partners use information collected through cookies or in other forms to improve experience on our site and pages, analyze how it is used and show personalized advertising.\n\nAt any point, you can opt out of the sale of all of your personal information by pressing\n\nDo not sell or share my personal information\n\nYou can find out more in our [privacy policy](https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy) and [cookie policy](https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies), and manage your choices by going to ‘California resident – Do Not Sell’ at the bottom of any page.\n\nCloser\n\nTPC Test",

We have recently seen an **increase in clade II mpox cases in the Puget Sound Area** associated with sexual and intimate contact among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, transgender people, and non-binary people **. In September 2025, there were 35 cases diagnosed in King County, the largest number of new diagnoses in a month since the end of the 2022 outbreak.**\n\nIn addition, the WA DOH has been monitoring for a potentially more severe strain of mpox(clade I) since 2024. An outbreak of clade I mpox is ongoing in Central and East Africa and several [travel-related clade I mpox cases](https://www.std.uw.edu/go/comprehensive-study/mpox/core-concept/all#epidemiology) have been reported in other states. On September 24th, 2025, WA DOH and [Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department (TPCHD),](https://tpchd.org/news/doh-detects-clade-i-mpox-in-pierce-county-wastewater) working in collaboration with the University of Washington, detected clade I MPXV in wastewater in Pierce County. WA DOH has not yet been notified of a case of clade I mpox, and the risk to the community remains low.\n\n## Actions requested\n\n- Immediately [report all suspected cases of mpox to PHKSC](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/mpox).\n- Consider mpox on your differential for any patients with [signs and symptoms of mpox](https://www.std.uw.edu/go/comprehensive-study/mpox/core-concept/all#clinical-manifestations), even if:\n\n  - Diagnosis of syphilis or herpes is considered more likely (co-infections can occur)\n  - The patient has a history of mpox vaccination. Mpox infections in people who previously received one or more vaccine doses are usually:\n    - Less severe\n    - May present subtly as proctitis without anogenital lesions, or with only a few lesions\n    - May present without prodromal constitutional symptoms.\n- Consider the possibility of clade I mpox in persons with a recent travel history to Central or East Africa or contact with a confirmed or suspected case of clade I mpox\n  - There is no clinical distinction in the [signs and symptoms](https://www.std.uw.edu/go/comprehensive-study/mpox/core-concept/all#clinical-manifestations) of clade I mpox and clade II mpox.\n- Test for mpox:\n  - Testing may be available through your facility's clinical or commercial laboratory.\n  - If possible, choose a PCR test option that includes _clade determination_ testing.\n  - Follow mpox specimen collection guidelines for your facility, or refer to [specimen](https://www.medialab.com/dv/dl.aspx?d=2874457&dh=ef27a&u=69790&uh=0e2a1) [collection guidelines from WA DOH](https://www.medialab.com/dv/dl.aspx?d=2874457&dh=ef27a&u=69790&uh=0e2a1).\n  - If you do not have access to clade determination testing and suspect clade I mpox, contact PHSKC to request testing at the [WA Public Health](https://www.medialab.com/dv/dl.aspx?d=2874457&dh=ef27a&u=69790&uh=0e2a1) [Laboratories](https://www.medialab.com/dv/dl.aspx?d=2874457&dh=ef27a&u=69790&uh=0e2a1) (PHL).\n\n    - Do NOTsend specimens to the PHL without prior approval from PHSKC.\n- Continue to vaccinate [individuals who are eligible](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/348906-GuidelinesForJYNNEOSVaccineUse.pdf) to receive mpox vaccination.\n\n  - Mpox vaccine is effective against both mpox clades.\n  - Booster doses are currently not recommended by the CDC if someone has already completed their series.\n  - Obtain vaccine from commercial suppliers.\n    - WA DOH offers limited doses of JYNNEOS vaccine to clinics who serve individuals for whom vaccine is recommended (see [Mpox Vaccine](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/348-1095-MpoxVaccineOpportunity.pdf) [Opportunity](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/348-1095-MpoxVaccineOpportunity.pdf)).\n- Offer the mpox vaccine as [post-exposure prophylaxis](https://www.std.uw.edu/go/comprehensive-study/mpox/core-concept/all#treatment) (PEP) to individuals who have had direct contact with someone with mpox. PEP is effective against both mpox clades.\n\n  - Encourage patients to work with PHSKC or other local health jurisdictions to connect close contacts and sexual partners to PEP.\n  - PEP should be offered as soon as possible after exposure to someone with mpox:\n    - Within 4 days of exposure to prevent illness.\n    - Up to 14 days after exposureto reduce risk of severe disease.\n- Treatment and management for patients with clade I mpox is the samefor clade II.\n\n  - Most immunocompetent patients with mpox will improve with supportive care alone.\n  - Mpox [treatment](https://www.std.uw.edu/go/comprehensive-study/mpox/core-concept/all#treatment) is available under the CDC's Investigational New Drug Protocol for qualifying patients who are immunosuppressed or have severe disease.\n  - Contact PHSKC and/or WA DOH at [mpoxconsult@doh.wa.gov](mailto:mpoxconsult@doh.wa.gov) for assistance with evaluating need for therapeutics.\n- Offer HIV and syphilis testing, [mpox vaccination](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/348906-GuidelinesForJYNNEOSVaccineUse.pdf), [HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/hiv/prevention/pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep), and [doxy-PEP](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/150282DearColleagueLetterDoxyPEP.pdf) to patients who are gay or bisexual men, or the sex partners of gay or bisexual men.\n- Travel health providersshould conduct a sexual health history with patients and offer mpox vaccination to travelers visiting a country with sustained clade I mpox transmission regardless of the patient's gender identity or sexual orientation, if they anticipate experiencing any of the following:\n\n  - Sex with a new partner,\n  - Sex at a commercial sex venue, like a sex club or bathhouse,\n  - Sex in exchange for money, goods, drugs, or other trade,\n  - Sex in association with a large public event or festival.\n\n## Background\n\nMPXV is the virus that causes mpox infection. Since the 2022 global outbreak of mpox, mpox has continued to occur in WA with a pattern of diagnoses concentrated in the late summer and fall.\n\nMpox is often associated with a painful rash, frequently located on the genitals or anus, along with other symptoms, that progresses through several stages. Mpox is spread through close contact with a person with mpox, direct contact with contaminated materials, or direct contact with infected animals.\n\nThere are two clades of MPXV, clade I and clade II. While both clades cause similar symptoms, there is historical evidence that clade I MPXV is more transmissible, and often causes more severe disease than clade II, with case fatality rates reported up to 10%, with higher risk for children and pregnant people. However, people with clade I mpox who are provided high-quality supportive care have a [significantly lower mortality than those who were not connected to care](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/antiviral-tecovirimat-safe-did-not-improve-clade-i-mpox-resolution-democratic-republic-congo). The management of clade I mpox is similar to that for clade II mpox. Mpox continues to be reported across the [United States](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report--58.pdf?sfvrsn=273f5819_3&download=trueun) and six clade I cases have been reported in the United States.\n\nTecovirimat, or TPOXX, is an antiviral for smallpox that was used for mpox treatment during the 2022 global clade II outbreak. Initial results from two clinical trials have demonstrated that tecovirimat is safe to use for people with mpox, but that it did not reduce the time to resolution of mpox lesions. Tecovirimat efficacy is still being evaluated for patients who are immunocompromised and for those with severe disease. Tecovirimat, along with other investigational drugs, are still available under CDC's expanded access Investigational New Drug Protocol for eligible patients.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Mpox resources - King County, Washington](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/mpox)\n- [Current mpox cases and vaccine administration - King County, Washington](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/mpox/data)\n- [WA DOH Mpox webpage](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/mpox)\n- [WA DOH Mpox FAQ](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/mpox/frequently-asked-questions)\n- [WA PHL Specimen Collection and Submission Instructions](https://www.medialab.com/dv/dl.aspx?d=2874457&dh=ef27a&u=69790&uh=0e2a1)\n- [WA DOH Reporting and Surveillance Guidelines: Mpox](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/420-415-Guideline-Mpox.pdf)\n- [WA DOH Mpox Data Dashboard](https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/mpox/mpox-data)\n- [WA DOH Guidelines for JYNNEOS Vaccine Use](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/348906-GuidelinesForJYNNEOSVaccineUse.pdf) (PDF)\n- [WA DOH Mpox Vaccine Opportunity](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-03/348-1095-MpoxVaccineOpportunity.pdf) (PDF)\n- [CDC US Mpox Wastewater Data](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance/mpox-data.html)\n\nexpand\\_less\n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate",
