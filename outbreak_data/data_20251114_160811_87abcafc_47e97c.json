If the situation changes, this interim definition will be updated accordingly.\n\n### For health departments\n\nPlease see [Health Alert Network (HAN) – 00501, Monkeypox Caused by Human-to-Human Transmission of Monkeypox Virus with Geographic Spread in the Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00501.asp) for more information on clade I diagnostic testing.\n\n## Case Definition of Monkeypox Reinfection\n\nMonkeypox reinfection occurs when a person who was classified as a confirmed or probable monkeypox case, has a recurrence of monkeypox symptoms after complete resolution† of the initial confirmed or probable MPXV infection.\n\n### Suspect Monkeypox Reinfection Case\n\nA case that fits the clinical description of monkeypox reinfection and meets any of the following criteria:\n\n- New rash\\*, **OR**\n- Meets one of the epidemiologic criteria and has a high clinical suspicion for monkeypox\n\n### Probable Monkeypox Reinfection Case\n\nA case that meets the criteria for a suspect monkeypox reinfection case **AND** demonstrates one of the following from a patient specimen:\n\n- Orthopoxvirus or MPXV DNA by polymerase chain reaction of a clinical specimen **OR**\n- Orthopoxvirus using immunohistochemical or electron microscopy testing methods **OR**\n- Demonstrable increase in anti-Orthopoxvirus IgG antibodies in paired serum samples collected within 3 days of symptom onset and 7-14 days after symptom onset, for patients with no prior monkeypox/smallpox vaccination or vaccinated ≥180 days prior to symptom onset\n\n### Confirmed Monkeypox Reinfection Case:\n\nA case that meets criteria for a probable monkeypox reinfection case **AND** has significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genetic variation between MPXV genetic sequences‡ from clinical specimens obtained from two or more episodes of MPXV infection separated by complete resolution of symptoms within the same individual.\n\n## Considerations for Monkeypox Reinfection\n\n- Persistent MPXV infection is defined as MPXV infection without clinical improvement or resolution of symptoms.\n- Relapsed MPXV infection is defined as MPXV infection that has improved, but not completely resolved, followed by clinical worsening or new monkeypox symptoms.\n- Patients with severe immunodeficiency such as in people living with HIV with CD4 counts <200 can be at risk for persistent and/or relapsed MPXV infections.\n- Patients may develop symptoms caused by other infections during MPXV infection or after their initial infection resolves.\n\n\\*The characteristic rash associated with monkeypox lesions involve the following: deep-seated and well-circumscribed lesions, often with central umbilication; and lesion progression through specific sequential stages—macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and scabs; this can sometimes be confused with other diseases that are more commonly encountered in clinical practice (e.g., secondary syphilis, herpes, and varicella zoster). Historically, sporadic accounts of patients co-infected with monkeypox virus and other infectious agents (e.g., varicella zoster, syphilis) have been reported, so patients with a characteristic rash should be considered for testing, even if other tests are positive. People with severe immunodeficiency (e.g., advanced HIV) may have skin lesions that are necrotic, diffuse, and plaque-like.\n\n† Complete resolution is defined as disappearance of all clinical symptoms of monkeypox including fever, chills, lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, lesions, or other skin disturbances caused by MPXV, and any other persistent symptoms associated with MPXV infection.\n\n‡ If there are no substantial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or significant genetic variation between MPXV sequences from clinical specimens from two or more episodes of MPXV infection obtained from the same individual then the case should be classified as a probable case.\n\n[Clinical Overview](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html)\n\nSept. 12, 2024\n\n[Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html#content-sources) [Print](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html#print) [Share](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html#share)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmonkeypox%2Fhcp%2Fcase-definitions%2Findex.html \"Share to Facebook\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmonkeypox%2Fhcp%2Fcase-definitions%2Findex.html&title=Monkeypox%20Case%20Definitions \"Share to LinkedIn\") [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmonkeypox%2Fhcp%2Fcase-definitions%2Findex.html&text=Monkeypox%20Case%20Definitions \"Share to Twitter\") [Syndicate](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/sharecontent \"Embed this Page\")\n\nContent Source:\n\n[National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/index.html)\n\nSources\n\n- Adler et al., 2022; Altindis et al., 2022; _Clinical Recognition: Key Characteristics for Identifying Monkeypox_, 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Lum et al., 2022; Petersen et al., 2019; _Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice._\n- Adler, H., Gould, S., Hine, P., Snell, L.

The disease presents with symptoms similar to smallpox but with a lesser severity.\n\nMonkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research, hence the name ‘monkeypox.’ The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has subsequently spread to other central and western African countries. There are two known clades of the virus: clade I and clade II. The clade I, which is most frequently reported from countries in central Africa, tends to be more severe than clade II. Cameroon is the only country known to harbour both clades.\n\n## Menu\n\n- [Key Facts](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#keyfacts)\n- [Fact Sheet](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#factsheet)\n- [FAQ](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#faq)\n- [Guidance Documents](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#guidance)\n- [News Updates](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#news)\n- [Media Advisories](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#media)\n\n## Key Facts\n\n#### Recovery\n\nMonkeypox is usually mild, and most people recover within a few weeks\n\n#### Testing\n\nDiagnostic testing to confirm cases involves using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction\n\n#### Vaccines\n\nVaccines developed to protect against smallpox and monkeypox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections and antivirals\n\n#### What\n\nMonkeypox is a rare, viral zoonotic disease that is caused by the monkeypox virus\n\n#### Where\n\nIt occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa\n\n#### Transmission\n\nMonkeypox can spread in humans through close contact, often skin-to-skin contact, with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus such as clothing, bedding, towels\n\n#### Symptoms\n\nSigns and symptoms of monkeypox include fever, rash and swollen lymph nodes\n\n#### Recovery\n\nMonkeypox is usually mild, and most people recover within a few weeks\n\n#### Testing\n\nDiagnostic testing to confirm cases involves using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction\n\n#### Vaccines\n\nVaccines developed to protect against smallpox and monkeypox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections and antivirals\n\n#### What\n\nMonkeypox is a rare, viral zoonotic disease that is caused by the monkeypox virus\n\n#### Where\n\nIt occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa\n\n#### Transmission\n\nMonkeypox can spread in humans through close contact, often skin-to-skin contact, with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus such as clothing, bedding, towels\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-1-868x1024.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-1.jpg)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-2-868x1024.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-2.jpg)\n\n### Download the Africa CDC factsheet that explains everything you need to know about Mpox.\n\n[Download](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet.pdf)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Mpox?\n\nMpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a rare viral zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It is primarily found in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa and presents with symptoms similar to smallpox, though generally less severe. The virus has two distinct clades: Clade I and Clade II.\n\nWhere is Mpox most commonly found?\n\nMpox occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa. The disease is endemic in these regions, with countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, and Nigeria frequently reporting cases.\n\nHow does Mpox spread?\n\nMpox can spread to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, or with materials contaminated by the virus, such as clothing, bedding, and towels. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct skin-to-skin contact, including intimate or sexual contact, and respiratory droplets during sustained face-to-face interaction. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during birth or through close contact afterward. Transmission from animals to humans can occur through contact with infected blood, bodily fluids, or lesions.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Mpox?\n\nSymptoms of Mpox include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. The rash typically progresses through several stages: macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally crusting and desquamation over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include headache, muscle aches, chills, and exhaustion. The disease is self-limiting, with most people recovering within a few weeks if detected and treated early.\n\nHow severe is Mpox, and who is most at risk?\n\nMpox is usually mild, with most people recovering within a few weeks. However, the severity can vary, with Clade I, found mostly in Central Africa, tending to be more severe than Clade II. Immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are more vulnerable to severe disease.\n\nHow is Mpox diagnosed?\n\nMpox is diagnosed through laboratory testing, specifically using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral DNA in samples collected from skin lesions. Proper specimen collection, handling, and storage are crucial for accurate diagnosis.\n\nAre there treatments for Mpox?\n\nThere are currently no specific treatments for Mpox. Care focuses on palliative treatment to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Although not specifically approved for Mpox, antivirals developed for smallpox may offer some benefits, particularly in severe cases or among high-risk individuals.\n\nAre there vaccines available for Mpox?\n\nYes, vaccines are authorized to prevent Mpox virus infections. Vaccination is recommended for close contacts of confirmed cases and for high-risk populations, including healthcare workers and immunocompromised individuals. The vaccines JYNNEOS (Imvamune or Imvanex) and ACAM2000 are available for preventing Mpox infection.\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect I have Mpox?\n\nIf you suspect you have Mpox, seek medical attention immediately. Isolate yourself from others to prevent spreading the virus, and follow public health guidance on managing symptoms and preventing transmission.\n\nHow can Mpox be prevented?\n\nPrevention of Mpox involves:\n\n- **Avoiding close contact** with infected individuals or animals.\n- **Practicing good hygiene,** such as regular handwashing and using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\n- **Using personal protective equipment (PPE)** in healthcare settings.\n- **Getting vaccinated** if you are at high risk or have been exposed to the virus.\n\nWhat is Africa CDC doing to combat the Mpox outbreak?\n\nAfrica CDC has declared the ongoing Mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS). The agency is mobilizing resources, strengthening surveillance, supporting laboratory testing, and providing technical support to African Union Member States to interrupt the transmission of Mpox across the continent. Efforts include event-based and community surveillance, enhancing laboratory capacities, and coordinating the procurement of vaccines.\n\n## Multimedia\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Makumbu-Tresor-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/dr-makumbu-tresor-africa-cdc/ \"Dr. Makumbu Trésor, Africa CDC\")\n\n### [Dr. Makumbu Trésor, Africa CDC](https://africacdc.org/video/dr-makumbu-tresor-africa-cdc/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/africacdc_press_briefing-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/africa-cdc-special-briefing-on-mpox-other-health-emergencies-in-africa/ \"Africa CDC Special Briefing on MPOX & Other Health Emergencies in Africa\")\n\n### [Africa CDC Special Briefing on MPOX & Other Health Emergencies in Africa](https://africacdc.org/video/africa-cdc-special-briefing-on-mpox-other-health-emergencies-in-africa/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/what-is-mpox-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/what-is-mpox/ \"What is Mpox?\")\n\n### [What is Mpox?](https://africacdc.org/video/what-is-mpox/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/symptoms-of-mpox-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/what-are-the-symptoms-of-mpox/ \"What are the symptoms of Mpox?\")\n\n### [What are the symptoms of Mpox?](https://africacdc.org/video/what-are-the-symptoms-of-mpox/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/symptoms-of-mpox-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/how-is-mpox-transmitted/ \"What are the symptoms?\")\n\n### [What are the symptoms?](https://africacdc.org/video/how-is-mpox-transmitted/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/S.E.-Dr-Jean-Kaseya-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/s-e-dr-jean-kaseya-directeur-general-africa-cdc/ \"S.E.

The revised strategy focuses on controlling outbreaks, while expanding vaccination coverage and transitioning toward a longer-term, sustainable response.\n\nMpox is a viral illness that spreads between people, mainly through close contact. It causes painful skin and mucosal lesions, often accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be debilitating and disfiguring.\n\nHistorically a zoonotic disease transmitted from infected animals, mpox has increasingly shown a tendency to spread between people. In 2022, a variant of the virus, clade IIb, began spreading globally through sexual contact. Since late 2023, yet another viral strain, clade Ib, began spreading through sexual networks and within households and through close contact. This prompted Africa CDC to declare a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security and the WHO Director-General to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2024.\n\nBy August 2024, the virus had begun spreading from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 4 neighbouring countries. Since then, 28 countries around the world have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib. Outside Africa, cases remain largely travel-related. However, within Africa, in addition to transmission in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, local transmission has now been documented in additional countries including the Republic of the Congo, South Africa, South Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.\n\nSince the declaration of the emergency, both regional and global support has increased, particularly for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak. The Africa CDC and WHO Joint Continental Mpox Plan has guided these efforts, focusing on ten key pillars: coordination, risk communication and community engagement, disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, clinical management, infection prevention and control, vaccination, research, logistics, and maintaining essential health services.\n\nVaccination efforts are underway, with more than 650 000 doses administered in 6 countries, 90% of which have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Overall, over a million doses have been delivered to 10 countries, with efforts ongoing to secure additional vaccine supplies.\n\nDiagnostic testing capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has grown significantly, driven by the expansion of laboratory infrastructure - from 2 laboratories in late 2023 to 23 laboratories in 12 provinces today. With new, near-point-of-care tests currently being rolled out in the country, capacity is expected to increase even further.\n\nDespite this progress, major challenges remain. Ongoing conflict and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the incidence of mpox remains high, as well as humanitarian aid cuts, continue to limit the public health response and restrict access to essential services. Across countries and partners, over US$ 220 million is needed to fill funding gaps for the mpox response.\n\nThe updated Continental Response Plan calls for intensified efforts to bring outbreaks under control, while also taking concrete actions to integrate mpox into routine health services.\n\nAlong with the Continental Response Plan for Africa, WHO has updated the global strategic plan to curb - and where feasible, to stop - human-to-human transmission of mpox. In the first two months of 2025, 60 countries reported mpox, with the majority of cases and deaths reported from the African continent.  The joint Continental Response Plan is aligned with the global strategy.\n\nAfrica CDC and WHO continue to work closely with national governments, local communities, and partners to curb transmission, control the outbreak, and build longer-term resilience within public health systems.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nWHO Media Team\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n**Email:** [mediainquiries@who.int](mailto:mediainquiries@who.int?Subject=RE)\n\nRelated\n\n[Mpox Continental Response Plan 2.0 – Africa CDC](https://africacdc.org/download/mpox-continental-response-plan-2-0/)\n\n[Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan – April 2025](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-april-2025)\n\n[WHO's work on mpox](https://www.who.int/health-topics/mpox)\n\n[Fact sheet on mpox](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mpox)",

Both types spread the same way and can be prevented using the same methods.\n- There have been more than 40,000 cases of clade I monkeypox in several countries in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- There have also been several travel-associated clade I monkeypox cases reported in countries in other parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.\n- There's an outbreak of clade II monkeypox in West Africa. Several cases in the United States have been tied to travel from the area.\n- Clade II monkeypox cases continue to spread at low levels in many countries around the world.\n- CDC works with public health partners across the world to monitor for monkeypox cases and increase surveillance capacity, in addition to other activities.\n\n\n![A colorized transmission electron microscopic image of monkeypox virus particles, found within an infected cell](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/09/26500_lores.jpg)\n\n## Current situation\n\n### In the United States\n\n- Health authorities in Southern California have reported three cases of clade I monkeypox in people with no recent travel. All three individuals are recovering from the illness. Viral genomic (DNA fingerprint) data indicate that these three cases may be linked to a different US case reported in August 2025. For more information see [Community Spread of Clade I Mpox Within California](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/CAHAN/Community-Spread-of-Clade-I-Mpox-Within-California.aspx).\n- There have been six reported cases of clade I monkeypox in the United States in people who had recently traveled to affected areas associated with the outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- CDC regularly [assesses the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to the overall population and specific populations within the United States posed by the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/); it remains low.\n- Clade II monkeypox is [still circulating at low levels](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/data-research/cases/index.html).\n  - CDC is tracking a recent uptick of U.S. cases of clade II across several different states linked to an [outbreak of clade II monkeypox in Sierra Leone, Liberia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), and other West African countries. CDC is collaborating with U.S. laboratories and Sierra Leone contacts to better understand the situation.\n- Children have historically gotten monkeypox in endemic areas in Western and Central Africa, and in this outbreak the high number of children with monkeypox reported in likely reflects spread within households.\n  - Based on what we know right now, we [don't expect to see the same sort of risk in children](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/data-research/clade-i-monkeypox-in-children-in-africa-and-potential-impacts-on-children-in-the-united-states.html) if monkeypox were introduced in the United States for reasons including different household makeup and size, access to disinfecting products, and improved access to medical care.\n\n[Clade I Monkeypox Outbreak Originating in Central Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html)\n\nOutbreaks of clade I monkeypox are occurring in Central and Eastern Africa\n\n[Clade II Monkeypox Outbreaks around the World](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html)\n\nInformation on the ongoing outbreak of clade II monkeypox\n\n### Across the globe\n\n- There are [outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in Central and Eastern Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html).\n  - Clade I has two subclades, clade Ia and clade Ib.\n  - In Central Africa, people have gotten clade Ia monkeypox through contact with infected dead or live wild animals, household transmission, or patient care; a high proportion of clade Ia cases have been reported in children younger than 15 years of age.\n  - More recently, subclade Ib has been identified in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo and has spread through intimate and adult sexual contact, including heterosexual spread with sex trade workers. Further spread outside of eastern DRC has occurred.\n  - Based on what we know now, clade Ib monkeypox has a lower case-fatality rate than clade Ia monkeypox.\n- Sustained and local person-to-person spread of clade I monkeypox has taken place in some non-endemic countries through sexual contact, day-to-day household contact, and within the healthcare setting in the absence of personal protective equipment.\n- As of September 15, 2025, the countries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia are experiencing **sustained** human-to-human transmission of the virus; there is also evidence of sustained transmission in Central African Republic and Republic of the Congo.\n- As of September 15, 2025, countries reporting travel-associated cases of clade I monkeypox since January 1, 2024, include Angola, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zimbabwe.\n- The [ongoing global outbreak of clade IIb](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) monkeypox has caused more than 100,000 cases in 122 total countries, including 115 countries where monkeypox was not previously reported.\n- Sierra Leone, Liberia, and other countries in West Africa are experiencing an outbreak of **clade II monkeypox**.\n  - Travelers to Sierra Leone and Liberia should review the [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), which includes information about the [monkeypox vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html) for eligible people.\n\n### Global case data\n\nFor global case data since January 1, 2024, see [2022-24 Monkeypox (Monkeypox) Outbreak: Global Trends (shinyapps.io)](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/#8_Disclaimers). Confirmed cases include those that are laboratory confirmed as monkeypox virus and may include cases only confirmed as _orthopoxvirus_. These data are provided for situational awareness and are subject to change.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n### In Africa\n\n- CDC continues critical work to protect the United States from emerging and infectious diseases. CDC has collaborated closely with key partners in affected countries to help support efforts to stop monkeypox at the source.\n- CDC and in-country partners across Africa have worked together on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity-building, strengthening local workforce capacity, case investigation, strengthening case management, infection prevention and control, and vaccine strategy and planning.\n- CDC collaborated with governmental and civil society partners in affected countries to collect and analyze case data, and to identify how monkeypox is spreading.\n- CDC trained 80 field epidemiologists in DRC and continues to provide key support for many who are still working in priority health zones. These CDC-trained epidemiologists are playing a key role in DRC efforts to detect cases, trace and monitor contacts, and increase community awareness of monkeypox, while also collecting and sending specimens to labs for testing, and training healthcare workers to do the same.\n\n- CDC is coordinating technical assistance in response to urgent needs identified by national governments and local partners in the areas of laboratory, surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, case management, infection prevention and control, psychosocial support, and vaccine planning.\n- The U.S. government is also working closely with several other countries in the region to assist with monitoring the situation as new information becomes available.\n\n- CDC's staff stationed in several countries affected by or on the border with countries with monkeypox cases provide critical information to inform U.S. preparedness efforts. Staff are connected to CDC's response efforts and can provide critical, real-time information to inform CDC's understanding of the outbreak, mitigate importation of cases into the U.S., and inform U.S. preparedness efforts.\n- Response efforts include increasing the number of monkeypox testing sites; improving specimen transport networks to quickly identify new cases; assisting with Ministry of Health-led vaccine implementation; strengthening emergency management systems; improving case surveillance; and training healthcare workers on infection prevention and control.\n\n\n### In the United States\n\n- CDC works closely with state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments to provide recommendations for clinical management, diagnosis, and prevention of monkeypox cases in the U.S.\n- CDC continually increases capacity in communities across the United States for early detection of monkeypox through existing surveillance systems, including [wastewater testing](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance/mpox-data.html).\n\n- CDC raises awareness for healthcare providers, including the latest guidance for [considering monkeypox](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) as a possible diagnosis in certain patients.\n- CDC has information and recommendations for members of the public, including those traveling to Central or Eastern Africa: [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-drc-neighboring-countries) and [Health Alert Network](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp) advisory.\n- CDC works with researchers and partner organizations to increase health equity around monkeypox and ensure that the populations most affected by monkeypox have access to the monkeypox vaccine.\n- CDC [conducts assessments](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to determine the risks of monkeypox to the people in the United States.\n\n## Resources\n\n- Get monkeypox and other vaccine recommendations when traveling to Central and Eastern Africa: [Destinations \\| Travelers' Health \\| CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)\n- [Clade II Monkeypox in Liberia and Sierra Leone -

Three years later, the world is seeing two very different realities: one in Africa, where the virus is surging, and another in the rest of the world, where transmission has slowed but risks remain.\n\n**Africa: A growing public health crisis**\n\nAcross Africa, mpox has become a major epidemic. Between January 2024 and May 2025, 26 African countries reported more than 139,000 suspected cases, including 34,824 confirmed infections and roughly 1,788 deaths. Disturbingly, over 21,000 of these confirmed cases occurred in the first few months of 2025 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Malawi are now at the epicenter. (1, 2)\n\nWhat worries researchers most is the rise of a new clade 1a variant carrying APOBEC3 mutations. These mutations may increase the virus’s ability to spread and adapt, raising concerns about whether mpox could become harder to control. Unlike the 2022–2023 outbreak — which was largely driven by clade IIb and linked to sexual networks in non-endemic countries — clade I variants in Africa are spreading more broadly, affecting children, rural communities and health care workers. (3, 4)\n\nWeak health systems, ongoing conflicts and reduced international funding have all hampered early detection and response. Many cases go undiagnosed because diagnostic labs are few and far between. Vaccination efforts remain limited: About 700,000 people have been vaccinated in 11 countries, a fraction of what is needed. (1, 5)\n\n**Outside Africa: A fragile calm**\n\nIn the rest of the world, the picture is calmer but not risk-free. The clade IIb strain that drove the 2022–2023 outbreak continues to circulate at low levels, mostly in specific sexual and social networks. Public health campaigns, targeted vaccination and community engagement have helped bring these numbers down. (3, 4)\n\nHowever, the virus has not disappeared. Since 2023, small numbers of travel-related clade I cases have been reported in the U.K., Thailand, Germany, India, Sweden, the United States and elsewhere. Thankfully, these imported cases have not yet led to sustained community transmission, but they highlight the ongoing risk of spillover from Africa. For this reason, the World Health Organization continues to monitor mpox closely, recognizing that while it is no longer classified as a public health emergency of international concern, the risk of international spread persists. (1, 5, 16)\n\n**Vaccines and treatments: Where we stand**\n\nThe good news is that we are not defenseless. The main vaccine against mpox is the non-replicating Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, known as JYNNEOS in the United States, Imvanex in Europe and Imvamune in Canada. (6) It has also been authorized in Switzerland, Singapore, Nigeria and the DRC. This vaccine has been a cornerstone of both pre-exposure and post-exposure protection during outbreaks.\n\nOlder vaccines, like ACAM2000 — a live, replicating smallpox vaccine — are still available in the U.S. and Canada, but because they can cause more side effects, they are generally used only when safer options are unavailable. Japan continues to use its long-standing LC16 smallpox vaccine. (6)\n\nOn the treatment front, tecovirimat, or TPOXX, remains the leading antiviral option. It is authorized for mpox in the EU, U.K., and Canada, and is available in the United States through an expanded-access program. (7,8) However, recent clinical trial data (STOMP and PALM 007) show that tecovirimat does not consistently shorten the course of illness or relieve symptoms in mild-to-moderate cases, particularly when given late in the disease. Its greatest potential benefit appears to be in early treatment of severe disease, immunocompromised patients or those with extensive lesions. Other antivirals — brincidofovir and cidofovir, both originally developed for other viral infections — are occasionally used off-label in severe or complicated cases, sometimes together with vaccinia immune globulin for added immune support. (9, 10) Despite these options, no drug is yet formally licensed specifically for mpox, meaning that clinical care continues to rely heavily on supportive management: pain control, hydration, nutrition and prevention of secondary infections.\n\nThe pipeline of new tools is expanding. Moderna is developing an mRNA-based mpox vaccine that has shown strong protection in animal studies, and several biotech companies are exploring new antivirals and combination treatments aimed at improving outcomes and preventing drug resistance. (11, 12)\n\n**Preparing for the future**\n\nExperts agree that mpox is a wake-up call for how the world deals with emerging infectious diseases. Strengthening surveillance is essential: This means investing in genomic sequencing, improving diagnostic capacity in low-resource settings and connecting data to global early warning systems.\n\nEquitable access to vaccines and medicines must also be a priority, supported by stockpiles, regional manufacturing hubs and streamlined regulatory approval. Research needs to push forward with broad orthopoxvirus vaccines and better therapeutics. (13, 14)\n\nBeyond the laboratory, community engagement is crucial. Stigma-free education campaigns can encourage people to seek testing and care early. A One Health approach, which links human and animal health surveillance, is vital to prevent the virus from spreading to new animal reservoirs. (14,15)\n\nFinally, countries should regularly test their preparedness with simulation exercises and invest in sustainable financing for outbreak response. Mpox is not gone. The window to act is now — before the next orthopoxvirus crisis catches the world off guard.\n\n_Image: Colorized transmission electron micrograph of mpox virus particles (blue) cultivated and purified from cell culture.
