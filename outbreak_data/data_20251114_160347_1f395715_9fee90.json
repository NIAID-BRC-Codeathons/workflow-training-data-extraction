When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

Someone who is infected can spread the disease to other people before noticing any symptoms.\n- CDC data show that unvaccinated people have a very high likelihood, about 90% risk, that they will contract measles if exposed. Unvaccinated children who have not previously been infected are more likely to get infected and should avoid exposure.\n  - One in five children who contract measles will be hospitalized.\n  - One in 20 children who contract measles will develop pneumonia.\n  - One to three children who contract measles in 1,000 will die.\n- CDC data show the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective. Individuals with a history of prior infection or vaccination who have received the full series of MMR vaccines are 97% protected within two to three weeks of vaccination and are unlikely to contract measles.\n- Measles infection can cause “immune amnesia” or immune suppression, effectively erasing the immune system’s memory and protection from other diseases. This immune weakening can last anywhere from weeks to years. This increases the risk of other infections, even if you have built immunity from a previous infection.\n\n* * *\n\n## Supporting Messages\n\nThe following information can be used in communications responses related to measles transmission, exposure, vaccine guidance, and vaccine safety information. **This is not an exhaustive list to address the outbreak situation, and health departments and other organizations should consult federal and state authorities in developing responsive communications for their priority audiences.**\n\n### Background on Measles\n\n- **Measles is one of the most highly contagious airborne diseases and is among the leading global causes of death in children, despite the existence of a highly effective and safe vaccine.**\n  - Medical and public health experts, including the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend that children and adolescents aged 12 months and older get an MMR vaccine to help protect them from serious illness.\n  - Children under five years of age, adults over 20 years of age, pregnant people, and people with immunocompromised health are most at risk of measles complications.\n- Measles infection causes a rash to appear, along with high fevers, diarrhea, coughing, runny nose, eye and ear infections. Someone who is infected can spread the disease to other people before noticing any symptoms, especially in the four days before and after the rash develops.\n  - In severe cases, measles causes children’s brains to swell, leading to seizures, deafness, cognitive disability, and possibly death. About 1 in every 20 children with measles also contracts pneumonia, the top cause of pediatric death from measles and a serious respiratory illness.\n  - Measles even causes immune system weakening that can last weeks to years. A suppressed immune system increases the risk of infection due to secondary bacterial and other infections.\n\n- **Measles outbreaks are on the rise again in the United States after reaching national eradication in 2000. Measles outbreaks are most common in communities where larger groups of people are unvaccinated.** This is a major public health concern given that about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. with measles require hospitalization.\n- [Since 1968](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), the measles vaccine has been the single most effective and safe approach to ensure people do not experience hospitalization, long-lasting health impacts, or death due to this viral disease.\n\n### Exposure Guidance\n\n- **The most helpful actions someone can take to prevent the spread of measles include isolating if they have a rash or believe they have been exposed, wearing a mask if around others, and contacting a healthcare provider immediately.** Isolation is a key health precaution used to prevent people with confirmed or suspected measles from spreading the virus through respiratory droplets or cross-contaminated surfaces.\n\n- **If you become sick and have not been vaccinated against measles:**\n  - Contact a healthcare provider immediately and alert them that you believe you were exposed to measles.\n    - Ask them about receiving an MMR vaccine and discuss treatment options.\n  - You should isolate for 21 days after your exposure.\n  - You should wear a mask and disinfect surfaces when near others to avoid the spread of germs in the air and on common household items.\n\n- **If you become sick and have been vaccinated against measles:**\n  - Contact a healthcare provider immediately and alert them that you believe you were exposed to measles.\n    - Discuss your vaccine history with them as part of determining possible treatment options.\n  - You should quarantine to limit contact with others. You may be advised to stay home for four days if you develop the measles rash.\n    - You should wear a mask and disinfect surfaces when near others to avoid the spread of germs in the air and on common household items.\n\n### Vaccine Guidance\n\n- **People of all ages can protect themselves and their loved ones from measles and vaccine-preventable diseases like mumps, rubella, and/or varicella (chickenpox) by getting the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines.**\n  - Both of these are two-dose vaccines traditionally given during early childhood when the immune system is weakest against disease. It only takes a few days for antibodies to develop in response to the MMR and MMRV vaccines. Those who have received the full series of MMR or MMRV vaccines are 97% protected within two to three weeks of vaccination and are unlikely to contract measles.\n  - Two vaccines can prevent measles in children 12 months to 12 years old: measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV). The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, and the MMRV vaccine additionally protects against varicella, also known as chickenpox. Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines require two doses.\n  - The [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/?_gl=1*1yntmyy*_ga*Mzc2MDIzNzkzLjE3NDY1NjM0NjI.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NjIyOTk1NTEkbzQwJGcwJHQxNzYyMjk5NTUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..*_gcl_au*NTk5NzcxNDMuMTc1OTg1NTI5NC4xNDM3Mzc2MTAyLjE3NTk5NTMwNzUuMTc1OTk1MzA3NQ..*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NjIyOTk1NTEkbzI1JGcwJHQxNzYyMjk5NTUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..?autologincheck=redirected) schedule recommends all children are vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. There are several options to protect children against all these diseases:\n\n    - One dose of the varicella vaccine and one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine between ages 12 and 15 months, and one dose of the varicella vaccine and one dose of the MMR vaccine between ages 4 and 6 years\n    - One dose of the varicella vaccine and one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine between ages 12 and 15 months, followed by one dose of the MMRV vaccine between ages 4 and 6 years\n    - One dose of the MMRV vaccine between ages 12 and 15 months, followed by one dose of the MMRV vaccine between ages 4 and 6 years\n  - The key difference between MMR and MMRV is that MMRV reduces the number of injections a child receives. Instead of four separate injections, a child may receive two or three separate injections if a caregiver opts for MMRV. This decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.\n- **Children over 12 months are eligible to get two doses of the MMR vaccine or MMRV, which protects against all known strains of measles.** Children who are unvaccinated, who have not completed both doses of the MMR or MMRV vaccine, or are unsure of their vaccination status should receive an MMR vaccine immediately. Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles can still receive the MMR vaccine up to 72 hours after exposure to help prevent or reduce the severity of an infection\n\n  - Due to their long-lasting nature, the MMR and MMRV vaccine doses are typically provided years apart; however, children in high-risk settings can get their second dose as soon as 28 days after the first dose.\n  - Children who are traveling with family to overseas areas where measles is less controlled may require slightly different vaccine timing to provide the best protection while abroad. In most cases, children should complete the doses at least two weeks before traveling.\n- **Teens and adults** should ensure they have completed the two-dose protocol to be best protected in the case of an outbreak.\n- **People who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or believe they could be pregnant** should contact their healthcare professional immediately to test for measles and discuss vaccine options.\n\n  - Pregnant people may be advised to wait to get the MMR vaccine until they are no longer pregnant.\n\nFor additional and more personalized information about vaccine options, encourage your audiences to contact their healthcare professional.\n\n### Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness\n\n- [Since the early 1950s,](https://historyofvaccines.org/history/measles/timeline) researchers and medical experts have worked to ensure that the [measles vaccines are safe](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html) for people ages 12 months and older. Today, MMR vaccines are routine for every child, and most who receive the vaccine do not have any serious complications afterward. Decades of clinical trial data and monitoring tens of millions of vaccinated people have continued to prove the vaccine is safe and effective.\n- [As early as the 1960s](https://historyofvaccines.org/history/measles/timeline), research has shown that measles vaccines are highly effective in preventing disease and the complications caused by the disease after exposure. **According to CDC data, receiving two doses of the [MMR vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Top%20of%20Page-,How%20Well%20Does%20the%20MMR%20Vaccine%20Work%3F,-MMR%20vaccine%20is) provides the highest level of protection, at 97% effectiveness. Even if only one dose is received, protection is still extremely high, at 93% effectiveness.** In rare cases, fully vaccinated people may contract measles, but their [symptoms tend to be milder compared to those who are unvaccinated and contract measles](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/expert-answers/getting-measles-after-vaccination/faq-20125397).\n\n  - Additionally, measles outbreaks typically occur in communities with high numbers of people who are unvaccinated. Vaccination can help reduce the spread of measles in communities and prevent infection in the small number of vaccinated people who do not have full immunity.\n\n## Communications Considerations\n\nHere are some questions to consider when communicating about the measles outbreak and measles (MMR) vaccines.\n\n### Who is your audience?\n\nThe more specific you can get about your audience, the more effective you can be in providing useful, relevant information.\n\n**Consider:**\n\n- Do I know what type of insurance my audience has? Am I specifically targeting people with public, private, or no insurance?\n- Am I communicating with individuals or organizations? If an organization, what kind of organization—school, employer, business, health care facility, etc.?\n\n### What do you want your audience to do with this information?\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- I want my community to follow specific guidance.\n- I want constituents to reach out to their insurer if they have questions about specific vaccine coverage.\n- I want community members to share this message with friends or family.\n- I want trusted messengers to help amplify this information.\n\n### What is your local context?\n\n**Consider:**\n\n- Local or state policies regarding active outbreaks that will directly impact your community.\n- Your county’s measles case rate.\n\nRead our [Plain Language for Public Health Guide](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/plain-language-for-public-health/) for more tips for effective, relevant, and accessible communications.\n\n### Related Communication Tools\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Measles-Vax.png)\n\n### [Communicating About Measles Vaccination (MMR and MMRV)](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/communicating-about-measles-vaccination-mmr-and-mmrv/)\n\nSeptember 25, 2025\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Communicating-about-Vaccine-Mandates.png)\n\n### [Communicating About Vaccine Requirements](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/communicating-about-vaccine-requirements/)\n\nSeptember 18, 2025\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chickenpox-and-Shingles.png)\n\n### [Communicating About Chickenpox and Shingles](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/communication-tools/communicating-about-chickenpox-and-shingles/)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n## Better communication for better health. ![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/themes/phcc/src/images/icons/heart-quote.svg)\n\nThe Public Health Communications Collaborative (PHCC) was developed in response to the urgent need for timely, relevant, and practical tools, messaging, and training to support and enhance the communications capacity of public health professionals across the country.\n\n[About](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/about/)\n\n![](https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/themes/phcc/src/images/phcc-about2x.webp)\n\nNotifications",

Measles in the United States: the current situation\n\nAs of April 24, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 884 measles cases in the United States; there are 11 outbreaks (defined as having three or more related cases) spread across 29 states \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib1)\\]. Among these, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania are leading. Texas predominates with 646 cases, followed by New Mexico with 65 \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib3)\\]. Most significantly, the outbreak is concentrated along the Western Texas–Southern New Mexico border \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib4)\\]. This cluster of counties holds 92.6 % of cases in Texas and all but one case in New Mexico \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib3)\\]. Furthermore, Gaines County, Texas, alone hosts 393 cases - more than any state in the country. This cluster contributes the majority of cases in the US this year and all three deaths. The first two deaths took place in Lubbock, with both children being from Gaines County and one from the Mennonite community; the third was an adult in Lea County \\[ [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib5), [\\[6\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib6), [\\[7\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib7)\\]. Importantly, all three individuals were unvaccinated \\[ [\\[8\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib8), [\\[9\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib9), [\\[10\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib10)\\].\n\nThese rates of measles seen so far in 2025 are unprecedented since the elimination of measles in the United States in 2000. Throughout this 25-year period, cases only rose to significant levels on two other occasions: 667 in 2014 (the “Disneyland Outbreak”) and 1274 in 2019 (centered in communities of Orthodox Jews in New York) \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib1)\\]. This is especially concerning since 2019 levels have almost been surpassed in only the first quarter of this year. The US does not stand alone in these trends, as it appears measles is growing throughout the globe. In Europe, cases are currently the highest they have been in 25 years with particular concern in Romania and Kazakhstan \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib12)\\]. For the year 2024, a total of 35 212 measles cases were reported across the EU/EEA, marking a notable increase (ten-fold), from the 3973 cases reported in 2023 \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib13)\\]. In Africa, the situation is equivalent and even more concerning as no country in the region has achieved elimination \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib14)\\]. While contexts differ considerably by country and region, these uniform trends are particularly concerning for global shifts in attitudes regarding vaccines \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib15)\\].\n\n## 2\\. Current risk factors for measles\n\nWhilst this rise in measles cases in the US has been portrayed in the media as an issue of immigration of non-US citizens into the country, it has been shown that there is no correlation between the share of a state's population that is foreign born and its rate of measles \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib16)\\]. The incidence of measles has become increasingly due to US-acquired cases - with most being epidemiologically or virologically linked to imported cases by US residents who have travelled to areas with high prevalence of measles \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib17)\\]. Therefore, herd immunity plays a significant role to prevent the spreading of these seeding cases; at least 95 % of the population must be immune to measles as it is a highly contagious virus.\n\nDespite decades of a good safety profile and disproven links to autism, measles vaccination rates do not reach this threshold (of 95 %) and are in fact dropping \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib18)\\]. National 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage was reported to be 92.7 % during the 2023–2024 school year \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib19)\\]. Yet, even this level of coverage is not observed in particular communities, with heterogeneous immunity observed in different populations throughout the country. Moreover, these vaccination rate estimations do not include homeschooled or some undocumented children, who are both less likely to be vaccinated \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib20), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib21)\\]. It is possible, then, that vaccination rates are lower than currently estimated. This ultimately means there are numerous pockets of individuals throughout the country at high risk of contracting measles. Indeed, the CDC reports that 97 % of all cases this year have occurred in those without evidence of vaccination coverage \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib1)\\].\n\nSignificantly, Gaines County, Texas, consistently holds the lowest reported levels of MMR vaccination in the state whilst having substantially higher numbers of cases \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib19)\\]. These low rates can be attributed to a variety of political, social, and religious factors. Notably, the county is home to a significant Old Colony Mennonite community, distinct from the Mennonite Church of America \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib22), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib23)\\]. This isolated group is considered to be under-vaccinated, however accurate rates are difficult to quantify since most children are either home-schooled or enrolled in nonaccredited private schools that do not record immunization data \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib5), [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib24), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib25)\\]. However, the situation is nuanced. While the Mennonite doctrine does not explicitly prohibit vaccinations, the Old Colony Mennonites tend to be highly conservative in their ideology \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib26)\\]. They typically live with limited access to technology and modern amenities, and firmly resist assimilation into mainstream society \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib27), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib28)\\]. This, combined with historical exclusion from earlier U.S. vaccine campaigns, contributes to skepticism towards modern medicine. Along with their isolated rural way of life, the community's strong emphasis on self-reliance distances them from access to healthcare. Interestingly, most Old Colony Mennonites speak a Low German dialect, further limiting access to healthcare \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib28)\\].\n\nThe Mennonite community in Gaines can be thought of as one example of a wider spread phenomenon. This would include the communities of the Orthodox Jews in New York and Amish in Ohio, as well as clusters of vaccine exemptions in California – all of whom are under vaccinated and have experienced outbreaks of measles in the past few years \\[ [\\[29\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib29), [\\[30\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib30), [\\[31\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib31)\\].\n\nThe drop in vaccination rates in the past five years could be attributed to the delay and pause in routine childhood vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as healthcare resources were shifted to prioritize the pandemic and parents adhered to home quarantine \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib32), [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib33)\\]. However, rates in administration of the vaccine have continued to decrease despite the end of the pandemic \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib19), [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib34), [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib35)\\]. As political and social discourse during the time of the pandemic focused heavily on the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, the conversation spilled over to include all vaccinations. Ultimately, attitudes and concerns towards vaccinations as a whole were affected \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib36)\\].\n\nThe increase in vaccine hesitancy also appears in line with changing cultural and political views in the country, with beliefs against vaccine use becoming more prevalent as right-wing ideologies grow in popularity. Far-right parties often promote individual liberty and skepticism towards scientific institutions, which lay fertile ground for vaccine distrust to thrive \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib37), [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib38)\\]. This changing political climate is also occurring worldwide and may be the reason why MMR vaccine rates are dropping on a global scale. According to the World Health Organization, rates in 2021 dropped to the lowest level in the past two decades \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib39)\\]. In 2023, this value is reported to have increased slightly but remains low at 83 % first-dose vaccination \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib40)\\]. This net drop corroborates with the rise in measles cases observed globally, further underscoring the role that the drop in vaccination rates are playing in this global resurgence.\n\nGrowing anti-immigration rhetoric seen in both conservative and liberal domains is also thought to be impacting protection against measles. Access to healthcare among undocumented immigrants is frequently limited by cost, language, knowledge of the healthcare system, and fear of deportation \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib41)\\]. As the culture of fear among undocumented individuals continues to intensify, as is occurring in 2025 in the US, larger numbers of individuals will be unable to seek healthcare and immunization \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib42)\\]. Therefore, pockets of vulnerable individuals will expand. In fact, Texas is currently home to the second greatest number of undocumented immigrants in the country. While access to vaccination is fundamentally part of the human right to health, protecting these individuals will also contribute to herd immunity and the overall greater safety of the country from vaccine-preventable diseases \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib43), [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib44)\\].\n\n## 3\\. Implications for clinicians and public health officials\n\nClinically, the risk of measles is often found in its complications. During the primary infection, complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia and encephalitis are common causes of mortality \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib45)\\]. Measles has also been shown to cause dysfunctional immunity, contributing to increased risk of secondary infections as well as reactivation of latent infections for up to two years \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib46)\\]. This immune amnesia can increase mortality even outside of the primary infection; this is particularly concerning in regions of the world with high prevalence of other severe infections. The public health risk of this virus, and therefore necessity of intervention, must thus not be underestimated \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib47)\\].\n\nWhile reasons for vaccine refusal are often complex, healthcare professionals must embrace this complexity and use evidence-based strategies to improve both attitudes towards vaccination as well as vaccination behaviors \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib48)\\]. On the frontlines of this work are primary care physicians, who are tasked with engaging in sustained dialogue with parents \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib49)\\]. Foremost, all children with accepting parents are to be routinely vaccinated at 12 and 60 months of age. If there is significant risk of exposure, an additional vaccine can be given between 6 and 12 months before beginning the routine schedule; if risk continues to increase, the second dose of vaccine can be given only 3 months following the first to achieve maximum immunity.\n\nWhile it is common practice to decline the acceptance of vaccine-refusing families into pediatric or primary care practice, there is no current evidence to show this is efficacious \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib50)\\]. Vaccine hesitancy is often interlaced with social determinants of health and various socioeconomic factors; since vaccine refusal has been shown to be a modifiable behavior, multi-visit conversations are encouraged and should involve fully understanding concerns and utilizing empathic responses \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib51), [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib52)\\]. The parents’ path from _pre-contemplation_ (not considering vaccination) to _action_ (vaccinating) must be step-wise; placing pressure on parents or exercising judgement can halt progress towards vaccination \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib53)\\]. Innovative approaches have also been developed, with success using social media platforms focused on presenting knowledge in a collaborative tone \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib48)\\].\n\nEfforts against vaccine hesitancy must also extend beyond the clinic to widespread public health efforts, particularly since religious and political factors are significantly at play \\[ [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib54)\\]. As seen in Gaines, a community's religious and cultural disposition can significantly impact health decisions and vaccine rates. Campaigns encouraging vaccination must be inclusive of the unique considerations of these groups in order to be effective; this point is emphasized by the CDC \\[ [\\[55\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib55), [\\[56\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib56), [\\[57\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib57)\\]. Forward-thinking approaches to reach these individuals are critically needed. One case for inspiration can be found in India, where healthcare workers and faith leaders co-designed a campaign which successfully improved vaccine uptake \\[ [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib58)\\].\n\nIn order to achieve protection for all children, both national and global efforts are required. This state of emergency in Gaines could have occurred in any community with enough vulnerability and hence needs to be understood as a cautionary tale. It may even be speculated that the risk of reestablishing endemic measles in the US due to this continually increasing vulnerability is now upon us \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib59)\\]. Beyond this, measles has been described as the canary in the coalmine, since outbreaks expose populations who are vulnerable to all vaccine-preventable diseases \\[ [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12135429/#bib60)\\]. With so many cases in the first quarter of the year, it can be extrapolated that vaccine-acquired immunity is currently at a record low.\n\n## References\n\n- 1.CDC.

To date in 2025, there have been three confirmed deaths from measles.\n\n**March 21:** Katherine Wells, DrPH, Director of Lubbock Public Health in Texas, joined [NACCHO’s _Podcast from Washington_](https://naccho.libsyn.com/podcast) to discuss the recent measles outbreak in the United States and initiatives they have implemented to slow the spread in Texas.\n\n**March 7:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory to notify clinicians, public health officials, and potential travelers about a measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico and offer guidance for prevention and monitoring. As of March 7, Texas and New Mexico have reported 208 confirmed cases associated with this outbreak (198 in [Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025) and 10 in [New Mexico](https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/)). As a part of this outbreak, two deaths have been reported: one in [Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak) and one in [New Mexico](https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188). More cases are expected as this outbreak continues to expand rapidly.\n\nWith spring and summer travel season approaching in the United States, CDC emphasizes the important role that clinicians and public health officials play in preventing the spread of measles.\n\n[Click here to read the report](https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html).\n\n**March 3:** U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary [issues statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html): Measles Outbreak is Call to Action for All of Us\n\n**February 26**: The Texas Department of State Health Services [reported the first death](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak) from measles in the ongoing outbreak in the South Plains and Panhandle regions.\n\n## **Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR)** **Vaccination**\n\nThe MMR vaccine is scientifically proven to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella. Given how contagious measles is, its evidenced potential for serious complications, and the recent outbreak developments, vaccination is a crucial and effective way protect yourself and your community from measles outbreaks.\n\nThe current recommendation for the MMR vaccine is two doses for children, typically administered around 12-15 months and 4-6 years of age. This vaccination schedule helps ensure optimal protection against measles, mumps, and rubella and contributes to community immunity, reducing the risk of outbreaks in the community. Individuals who are uncertain about their immunity can consult with a healthcare provider to determine if they have antibodies and to receive a booster dose.\n\n## **Resources and Toolkits**\n\n- [Measles Resources for Health Departments](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/guidance/index.html) (CDC): Key measles resources including case definitions and outbreak and response procedures.\n- [Be Ready for Measles Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/toolkit/index.html) (CDC): A toolkit to communicate with different audiences when preparing for and responding to measles cases and outbreaks.\n- [Public Health Preparedness Checklist: Measles Clusters and Outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/media/pdfs/2025/02/CDC-Public-Health-Checklist_Sept18_FINAL-updatedlinks-508.pdf) (CDC): Checklists for how to support measles preparedness at health departments in the short- and long-term as well as a checklist for healthcare system preparedness.\n- [2025 Measles Outbreak Guidance in Spanish](https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/moges/) (New Mexico Department of Health): Overview, reports, FAQ, and other resources related to the measles outbreak in New Mexico in Spanish.\n- [Measles Outbreak Toolkits](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/resources/index.html) (CDC): Resources for healthcare providers, local/state health departments, and settings where children congregate to respond to a measles outbreak.\n- [Vaccine Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html) (CDC): Routine MMR information, evidence of immunity, other considerations for measles vaccine.\n- [Traveling Abroad Summer Checklist Graphic](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/resources/travel-summer-checklist-graphic.html) (CDC): Graphic highlighting preparation for summer travel.\n- [Measles School Outbreak Simulator](https://epiengage-measles.tacc.utexas.edu/) (UT Austin).

    "content": "Save\n\nContents\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious virus with a primary case reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary cases per case patient) of 12 to 18. It is currently spreading rapidly owing to reduced measles vaccination coverage, which is due primarily to the disruption of local immunization programs by the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and of growing vaccine hesitancy.[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r1) Since 2024, all World Health Organization (WHO) regions have reported increased numbers of measles cases, with 395,521 laboratory-confirmed measles cases reported in 2024 and 16,147 reported during the first 2 months of 2025.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r2) Patients in more than half the reported cases were hospitalized, so the true number is probably much higher.[3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r3)\n\nThis review covers clinical presentations and complications of measles, current recommendations, and the epidemiologic background of measles. It also addresses the current debates on immunization and the treatment of measles and presents information on the origins of the various measles vaccines and updates on measles diagnostic testing and molecular genotypes.\n\n## Clinical Presentations and Complications\n\n### Classic Measles Syndrome\n\nBetween 10 and 14 days (range, 7 to 23) after exposure, illness starts with a prodromal phase that includes fever and any of three symptoms — cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (the “three Cs”). The prodromal phase lasts for 2 to 4 days. Koplik spots, small white spots on the buccal mucosa, are pathognomonic for measles but are not always present ( [Figure 1A](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1)). The spots may appear 1 to 2 days before the onset of rash and last for an additional 1 to 2 days after rash onset. A typical measles rash is an erythematous maculopapular exanthem that appears 2 to 4 days after the onset of fever, starting with the face and proceeding to the head, trunk, arms, and legs [Figure 1B](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1). Persons with the infection typically can transmit the virus 4 days before and 4 days after the eruption of the rash ( [Figure 1D](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1)). Diarrhea can appear early in the acute phase and may last for a month.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) Prodromal symptoms, rash, and diarrhea in any child should arouse suspicion for measles infection.\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/a3e5d59c-887d-4205-b19a-01e7b3fabdd4/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_f1.jpg)\n\nClinical Features and Pathogenesis of Measles.\n\nFeatures of measles include Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa (Panel A); rash on the trunk, spreading to the face, head, arms, and legs (Panel B); and conjunctivitis (Panel C). Day 0 denotes the day the measles rash appears; Day −4 is the probable start of infectiousness, Day 4 is the probable end of infectiousness, and Day −23 is the earliest possible exposure day (Panel D). CD150+ lymphocytes are T and B memory lymphocytes targeted by the measles virus. 3 Cs denotes cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, and MeV measles virus. Images in Panels A, B, and C were provided by Du Tuan Quy, M.D., with the approval of Le Nguyen Thanh Nhan, M.D., Ph.D., Children’s Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n\n#### Measles 2025\n\n•\n\nMeasles causes a range of serious health issues, including immune amnesia that may last up to 1 year in fully recovered patients and increased susceptibility to sometimes severe secondary infections. Research on restoring immunity more rapidly is needed.\n\n•\n\nMeasles vaccine has a long safety history and is highly effective against all circulating measles genotypes.\n\n•\n\nMeasles is highly contagious; therefore, a high coverage level (>95%) of both recommended doses of measles vaccine is necessary to prevent community transmission.\n\n•\n\nVitamin A supplementation is recommended for all persons who have measles to reduce complications and the risk of death, particularly in persons who have deficient levels of vitamin A, such as persons living in low- and middle-income countries. Vitamin A does not prevent measles infection. More data are needed regarding the benefits of vitamin A in persons living in developed countries who have measles.\n\n•\n\nWaning levels of maternal measles antibodies at 3 to 4 months of age has increased measles risk in young infants. Further research on the effectiveness of early measles vaccination is needed.\n\n•\n\nAdditional randomized, controlled trials are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of vaccine microneedle patches, which may help to increase vaccination coverage.\n\nBecause measles is a systemic infection, it can affect the skin, eyes, gut, and respiratory system. Complications that occur in approximately 30% of measles cases[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) — and frequently occur up to 1 month after infection — include diarrhea, pneumonia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis ( [Table 1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t1) and [Figure 1C](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1)).[5-14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) Pneumonitis and giant-cell pneumonia are rare but severe and potentially fatal complications of measles. These conditions are reported mainly in persons who are immunosuppressed and in young children.\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/5fc57d63-5308-4630-9801-53c070590258/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_t1.jpg)\n\n| Complications | Incidence in<br>Developed Countries | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pneumonia | 1–6 per 100 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | Among the most common complications during the first month of measles; most common cause of measles hospitalization |\n| Diarrhea | 8–10 per 100 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | Common complication during the first month of measles |\n| Keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis | 3–10 per 100 measles cases [6-9](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r6) | Keratoconjunctivitis may appear in the prodromal stages of measles and persist for as long as 3 months[6](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r6); keratitis with retinitis and optic neuritis also has been reported.[7-9](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r7) |\n| Corneal ulceration | Rare | Documented in 1–4 per 100 measles cases in the 1980s in Africa and South Asia[10,11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r10); measles can cause corneal ulceration directly and facilitate a secondary infection (such as herpes simplex keratitis) that leads to corneal ulceration[10,11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r10) |\n| Blindness | Rare | Measles is a leading cause of childhood blindness in places where measles is endemic; results of surveys conducted in schools in Africa in the 1970s suggested that measles was the cause of 33 to 79% cases of blindness.[11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r11) |\n| Otitis media | 7–9 per 100 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | One of the most common complications during the first month of measles; can lead to sensorineural deafness, which was observed in 5 to 10% of measles cases in the United States before the introduction of measles vaccination programs[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) |\n| Death | 1–3 per 1000 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | 16 per 1000 measles cases in low-income countries[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r12); 9 per 1000 measles cases in middle-income countries[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r12); up to 180 per 1000 measles cases reported in the context of humanitarian relief efforts during major outbreaks[13](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r13) |\n| Malnutrition | 8–10 per 100 measles cases |  |\n| Acute postinfectious measles encephalitis | 1 per 1000 measles cases[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) | Develops within the first week of measles, after the appearance of the first symptoms, and is associated with 20% mortality[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) |\n| Measles-inclusion body encephalitis | 1 per 1000 measles cases[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) | Develops within 7 days to 6 months after onset of measles and is associated with 100% mortality[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) |\n| Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis | 7–11 per 100,000 measles cases[5,14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | Develops within 7–10 years after measles and is associated with 100% mortality within 1–3 years after onset[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14); young children with measles (<2 years of age) are at increased risk |\n\nIncidence of Severe Complications Associated with Measles.\n\nEven after recovery, children who have had measles are at high risk for late complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition, and blindness. Blindness is usually due to severe corneal ulceration, and sometimes corneal perforation, in children who are deficient in vitamin A.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) Temporary immune amnesia caused by depletion of B-cell and T-cell memory by the measles virus has recently been shown to be a mechanism for longer-term susceptibility to secondary infections in persons who have had measles (see the [Supplementary Appendix](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Children recovering from measles are at elevated relative risk for serious secondary infection, particularly pneumonia. Even in a high-resource area of Germany, the risk of pneumonia among children with measles was elevated as compared with that among children who had noninfectious diseases (risk ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.4 to 2.0).[15](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r15) In low- and middle-income countries, the risk is greater than in countries with higher incomes, and measles is associated with substantial mortality.[16](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r16)\n\nMeasles-associated encephalitis is a rare but serious, and potentially fatal, complication. It can occur during the first 7 days of infection (acute postinfectious measles encephalitis), 1 to 6 months after infection (measles-inclusion body encephalitis), or even years after full recovery (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14)\n\n### Atypical Measles Syndrome\n\nAtypical measles syndrome was first reported in the 1960s among children who received the inactivated (killed) measles vaccine that was in use during the period 1963–1967. After these children were exposed to measles virus in the community, they became ill with a severe form of measles disease marked by high fever, an unusual type of rash (a petechial or morbilliform rash that began on the arms and legs), and severe pneumonia.[17](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r17) This atypical measles syndrome has been reported rarely since the inactivated measles vaccine was withdrawn in 1967.[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14)\n\n### Modified Measles Syndrome\n\nMeasles can occur in persons who are fully vaccinated (i.e., have received two doses) or who are undervaccinated. These breakthrough infections can result from primary vaccine failure, lack of seroconversion after immunization, or secondary vaccine failure due to waning of the measles-antibody level (waning immunity), which can occur 6 or more years after vaccination.[18](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r18)\n\nPersons with primary vaccine failure may have the classic measles syndrome, but persons with secondary vaccine failure tend to have milder symptoms — often only a rash with little or no fever, nonspecific respiratory symptoms, and a lower viral load. Persons with secondary vaccine failure are at lower risk for transmission than unvaccinated persons who have measles infection.[18](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r18)\n\n### Measles in Special Populations\n\nWhen measles outbreaks occur, persons with compromised immunity, such as malnourished children, immunocompromised persons (e.g., persons who have human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\] or are receiving cancer treatment), and pregnant persons are particularly vulnerable. Persons with HIV who are not immune to measles are at increased risk for more severe measles infection with pneumonia or encephalitis.\n\nIn a series of 23 pediatric cancer patients in China who had measles infection, 5 underwent ventilation, 1 had liver failure, and 4 died. These outcomes occurred even though 20 of the 23 patients had been vaccinated (including the 4 who died) and 21 had been treated with intravenous immune globulin.[19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r19)\n\nMalnutrition and measles have a historical link, particularly in the context of humanitarian relief efforts. The bidirectional relationship between measles and malnutrition was described decades ago.[20](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r20) Malnutrition is a primary contributor to death in 45% of fatal measles cases.[21](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r21) Measles is worse in children who are already malnourished, and postmeasles effects can lead to malnutrition in children who were not malnourished before they were infected with measles.[13](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r13) Measles can lead to or exacerbate vitamin A deficiency[22](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r22) or a persistent nutritional deficit.[23](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r23) Malnourished children have a poor response to measles vaccine and other vaccines.[24,25](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r24)\n\nAlthough measles virus is not teratogenic, measles in pregnant persons can lead to fetal loss, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature delivery.[26](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r26) The case fatality rate among pregnant persons with measles can range from 5% in areas where measles is endemic, such as in Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa, to 20 to 30% among fragile populations, such as refugee populations.[27](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r27) Preterm birth is reported as the most frequent fetal complication.[26](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r26)\n\n## Current Recommendations\n\n### Current Global Pediatric Measles Vaccination Policy\n\nMeasles vaccine has a long history. Various attenuated measles vaccine strains were developed and are in active use worldwide (see the [Supplementary Appendix](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap1)) either as a monovalent vaccine or combined with mumps and rubella vaccines, with or without varicella vaccine.\n\nThe recommended age for the first dose of measles-containing vaccine depends on the waning of maternal antibodies in the patient and the risk of measles exposure.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) In countries where measles is in elimination status (i.e., continuous transmission has been absent for more than 12 months), the first dose may be given at 12 to 18 months of age for maximum immunogenicity, although this schedule leaves most infants in the country susceptible to infection. In countries where measles is endemic — mainly low- and middle-income countries — the first dose of measles vaccine is usually given at 9 months of age. China and South Africa are exceptions, with the routine first dose given at 8 months and 6 months of age, respectively.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r2) Given that 10 to 15% of infants who receive the first dose at 9 months of age do not have seroconversion and to ensure protection for children who either do not have a response to the first dose or miss the first dose entirely, the WHO recommends a second dose for all children globally.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) The recommended shortest time between the two doses is 4 weeks. The timing of the first and second doses of measles vaccine in each country depends on the epidemiologic context and the recommendations of the immunization program of the country. The WHO also recommends an additional dose for infants 6 to 11 months of age during measles outbreaks in regions where measles is endemic.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4)\n\nIn the United States, the first dose is given at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years. Infants 6 to 11 months of age may also be given an additional dose in regions where there are outbreaks or before international travel ( [Table 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2)).[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28)\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/e68e9ebb-772d-401e-9e60-19a351da1c99/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_t2.jpg)\n\n| Recommendation | Schedule and Dose |\n| --- | --- |\n| Preschool children |  |\n| Routine childhood schedule | Two-dose schedule — First dose at 12 to 15 months of age (MMR vaccine), second dose at 4 to 6 years of age (MMR-V vaccine) |\n| In outbreak locations or before international travel | Additional dose is given as early as 6 months of age to all children younger than 12 months of age; routine two-dose schedule is still recommended, but earlier second dose is recommended [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) |\n| Healthy adults | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity; no booster program for those with evidence of previous vaccination on two-dose schedule [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Special populations |  |\n| Health care workers born before 1957 | One or two doses of measles vaccine unless evidence of immunity [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Health care workers born in 1957 or later | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Received measles vaccine between 1967 and 1989 | One or two doses of measles vaccine unless evidence of immunity [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| ≥12 mo of age with HIV infection | Two-dose schedule: first dose at 12 months of age (MMR vaccine), second dose can be earlier than routine (at 13 months of age; MMR vaccine) [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [§](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn4) |\n| International travelers | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Family carers of immunocompromised patients | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n\nSummary of Current Measles Vaccination Recommendations in the United States. [\\*](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn1)\n\n\\*\n\nAdapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, available at [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html). HIV denotes human immunodeficiency virus, MMR measles–mumps–rubella, and MMR-V measles–mumps–rubella–varicella.\n\n†\n\nA 28-day period between the doses is recommended.\n\n‡\n\nEvidence of immunity includes written documentation of one or more doses of measles vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not considered high risk; written documentation of two doses of measles vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk, including students at post–high school secondary educational institutions, health care personnel, and international travelers; laboratory evidence of immunity; laboratory confirmation of disease; and birth before 1957 (except in health care workers born before 1957, for whom the evidence of immunity is laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease).\n\n§\n\nMMR vaccine is indicated only in the absence of severe immunosuppression, which is defined as a CD4 percentage of less than 15% for at least 6 months in persons 5 years of age or younger and a CD4 percentage of less than 15% and CD4 count of less than 200 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter for at least 6 months for persons 5 years of age or older. MMR-V is contraindicated in persons with HIV infection; only MMR vaccine is approved for use in such patients.\n\nBecause the measles virus has a high reproduction number, high coverage of both doses of measles vaccine (≥95%) at the population level is required to maintain effective herd immunity against measles transmission.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) In reality, this goal is a very difficult one to attain for most countries owing to growing global vaccine hesitancy and other challenges, such as financial barriers, poor access to health care, and inappropriate contraindications in certain cases. Even when high vaccination coverage is achieved, small, poorly vaccinated communities may still have outbreaks.[30,31](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r30)\n\n### Postexposure Prophylaxis\n\nIn unvaccinated or undervaccinated persons, measles vaccine is recommended within 72 hours after exposure. When there are contraindications to the measles vaccine, such as in immunocompromised or pregnant persons or infants younger than 6 months of age, human immune globulin is recommended to be given within 6 days after exposure.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4)\n\nRecommendations for postexposure prophylaxis and the availability of immune globulin products vary among countries.[32](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r32) In many low- and middle-income countries, access to immune globulin is very limited owing to its high cost and low availability.\n\nA recent meta-analysis showed that the estimated effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of measles ranged from 76% (95% CI, 0 to 94) to 100% (95% CI, 56 to 100) with immune globulin and from 83% (95% CI, 34 to 96) to 100% (95% CI, not evaluable) with the measles vaccine.[33](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r33) Postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulin offers greater short-term protection than postexposure prophylaxis with the measles vaccine but at greater cost and use of resources.\n\nThe effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis may be affected by the concentration of measles antibodies in immune globulin products,[34](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r34) the nature and intensity of measles exposure events, and the timing of postexposure prophylaxis.[35](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r35) The timing of postexposure prophylaxis reported in the studies included in the meta-analysis was recommended mainly on the basis of the duration of measles incubation; there are very limited data on the effect of delayed postexposure prophylaxis.[33,36](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r33)\n\nBecause levels of measles antibodies in the immune globulin donor population have decreased over time,[37](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r37) measles antibody concentration in immune globulin products is also decreasing. This change highlights the need for periodic review of the recommended dose.[38,39](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r38) Although the correlates of protection for measles have been recently debated,[40](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r40) the previously published threshold (i.e., >120 mIU per milliliter) has been widely accepted and used as the target serum concentration for measles antibodies after postexposure passive immunization, thereby guiding the recommended dose.[38,39](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r38)\n\n### Management of Measles\n\nThere is no approved antiviral medication for measles. Management of measles infection involves early detection and treatment of complications as well as patient isolation to prevent nosocomial and community transmission.\n\nVitamin A deficiency has been associated with measles severity and mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries. In large-scale, community-based, randomized trials in many Asian and African countries between 1983 and 1992, administration of vitamin A reduced measles mortality by 34 to 50% among children 1 to 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) Vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol level, <10 μg per deciliter) is a major public health issue affecting preschool-age children in low- and middle-income countries.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) Since 1993, the WHO has recommended vitamin A, with specific doses according to age groups, to all persons who have acute measles infection, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A ( [Table 3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3)).[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) This recommendation is based on data from studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries,[43](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r43) and there has been no report of toxic effects from vitamin A in patients with measles who have received vitamin A according to WHO recommendations.[41,43](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) The benefit of routine vitamin A supplementation outside of treating measles or other specific diseases remains debated, particularly when the vitamin A–deficiency status is unknown.[44](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r44) In addition, routine vitamin A supplementation in excess of the recommended dietary allowance can cause acute and chronic toxic effects in well-nourished children and adults.[45](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r45) Children are particularly sensitive; daily intakes of more than 1500 IU per kilogram of body weight have been associated with toxic effects in children.[45](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r45)\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/a7a95bfd-40b8-48b8-940b-2823bbd014de/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_t3.jpg)\n\n| Age Group | Dose | Frequency |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Children |  |  |\n| <6 mo | 50,000 IU (15,000 μg RAE) | Daily for 2 days |\n| 6–11 mo | 100,000 IU (30,000 μg RAE) | Daily for 2 days |\n| >12 mo | 200,000 IU (60,000 μg RAE) | Daily for 2 days |\n| Previous vitamin A deficiency or eye complications caused by measles | Third dose | 2–4 wk after the second dose |\n| Adults [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3fn2) | No recommendation | No recommendation |\n\nU.S. Recommendations for Vitamin A Supplementation in Patients with Measles. [\\*](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3fn1)\n\n\\*\n\nAdapted from Stinchfield PA and Orenstein WA.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) IU denotes international unit, and RAE retinol activity equivalents.\n\n†\n\nThe U.S. recommendation aligns with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation.[42](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r42) However, the WHO recommends a dose of 5000 to 10,000 IU daily for 4 weeks in adult measles patients. Women of reproductive age should receive only lower, but more frequent, doses of vitamin A (e.g., a daily oral dose of 5000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin A for at least 4 weeks) owing to possible teratogenic effects.\n\nIn the only known study of the use of vitamin A in measles management in the United States, only 39% of patients received vitamin A and received a much lower dose than that recommended by the WHO.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) In contrast, recent cases of toxic effects of vitamin A intake associated with measles outbreaks in the United States (notably in West Texas) were linked to excessive or unsupervised intake of vitamin A outside medical guidance owing to misinformation. These data point to a need for clarity regarding vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of measles to inform health care workers and the public in the United States.\n\nData are limited regarding the benefit of vitamin A in the context of the United States, where vitamin A deficiency is rare. Measles depresses serum levels of vitamin A in well-nourished children to below the levels observed in malnourished children without measles.[46](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r46) In the United States, hospitalized children with measles frequently have low serum vitamin A levels, correlating with measles severity.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) Because vitamin A is critical in enhancing immune responses against infections,[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) supplementation with vitamin A is recommended in children with measles. A meeting on the subject led by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases in November 2019 provided suggestions on vitamin A doses ( [Table 3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3)).\n\n## Current Measles Epidemiologic Background\n\n### Immunity Gaps in Young Infants and Early Measles Vaccination\n\nRecent data have shown that the rate of decline of maternal antibodies has increased over time both in regions where measles is endemic and in areas where measles has been eliminated.[47,48](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r47) In Canada in the period 2014–2016, more than 90% of 3-month-old infants had levels of maternal measles antibodies that were lower than a threshold neutralization titer of 192 mIU per milliliter.[49](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r49) A recent multicountry modeling exercise predicted 70.8%, 88.3%, and 100% of infants would be seronegative by 2, 4, and 6 months of age, respectively.[50](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r50) A meta-analysis of data from low- and middle-income countries (2018–2024) showed that by 4 months of age, only 24 to 35% of children remained seropositive.[51](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r51) Clearly, many unvaccinated young infants in regions of measles outbreaks are at high risk for acquiring measles.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, more than 90% of the measles cases worldwide were among children in low- and middle-income countries.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) Most of those infected were children younger than 5 years of age, with the highest mortality among those younger than 1 year.[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r12) No systematic analysis has been conducted over the past decade to confirm the observed trend of increasing proportions of measles cases and deaths among young infants. Vietnam, which was among the top 10 countries in terms of number of measles cases in March 2025, had reported a rising number of cases among children 6 to 8 months of age; that age group represented 25% of measles cases in some areas.[52](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r52) Young infants are at heightened risk for severe measles-related complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death.[53,54](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r53) Children in this group are also at increased risk for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare but fatal condition.[55,56](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r55)\n\nIn recognition of the potential vulnerability of young infants, discussions on the timing of the first dose of measles vaccine have been under way for decades and more recently at the WHO.[4,57–60](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) An early dose of measles vaccine given at 3 to 4 months of age could provide protection throughout infancy. Three studies conducted more than a decade ago provided some data regarding the safety, efficacy, and potential blunting effect (i.e., reducing the immunogenicity, both short term and long term, of subsequent doses) of an early dose of measles vaccine given at 4 to 4.5 months of age.[61-63](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r61) This dose could be either the early administration of the first recommended dose of the vaccine or an additional dose to the current two-dose schedule.[61-63](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r61) Both approaches have shown acceptable safety and immunogenicity.[61,62](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r61) The first dose, when given at 4.5 months of age, provided 94% efficacy against measles infection and 100% efficacy against hospitalization for measles.[62](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r62) Determining the appropriate timing of an early dose requires a balance between the age-stratified infection risk (the age at which maternal antibodies would no longer inhibit measles vaccine immunogenicity) and the duration of vaccine effectiveness over time.[57,58](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r57) A trade-off of administering an early dose is the reportedly more rapid reduction of measles antibody in children who are vaccinated early in infancy.[64,65](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r64) Whether this antibody reduction would translate to reduced vaccine efficacy in later childhood is still an open question.\n\n### Immunity Gaps in Adults and Booster Dose\n\nBecause the two-dose measles vaccine schedule was not introduced in the United States until 1989, persons who received the vaccine between 1967 and 1989 may consider receiving a second dose if they are in a high-risk group, such as health care workers or international travelers.[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28) An extra dose of measles vaccine may be also considered in persons who received the vaccine between 1963 and 1967, because the inactivated (killed) vaccine that was used was less effective than the current live attenuated vaccine.[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28) Of note, persons who received measles vaccine between 1967 and 1989 or who received the inactivated measles vaccine may have immunity that is “boosted” over time by natural measles exposure, because measles was still endemic in the United States until 2000.\n\nAmong persons born before 1957 (before the first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963), natural measles immunity is even more certain because measles cases were common until that time. However, measles vaccine should still be considered in health care workers who do not have laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. Currently, there is no recommended routine catch-up vaccination program for adults in the United States.[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28)\n\nThe primary cause of the resurgence in measles cases is failure to vaccinate, not failure of the vaccine. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the WHO recommend routine boosters in persons who are fully vaccinated. Studies regarding serologic events conducted in the past 5 years in areas where measles is endemic and in ones where measles has been eliminated have reported immunity gaps in persons who received the vaccine on the two-dose schedule during childhood.[48,66,67](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r48) Most of these persons are 13 to 30 years of age, with some older than 40 years of age. Adults who have likely secondary vaccine failure account for some of the measles cases in outbreaks in well-vaccinated countries, as was the case recently in Mongolia.[68](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r68) A third dose of measles vaccine has been offered, mainly to health care workers, with similar safety and rates of adverse events as those seen with the recommended two doses. However, high antibody levels induced by the third dose waned quickly over a period of 1 to 3 years after the third dose.[69](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r69)\n\n### 2019 Increase in Measles Cases and Ongoing 2024–2025 Measles Crisis\n\nWorldwide, reported measles cases saw a dramatic increase in recent years, from a historic low of 132,490 in 2016 to 869,770 in 2019.[70](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r70) The global increase in measles cases in 2019 was driven by large outbreaks in several countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Samoa, Ukraine, and Brazil were the countries most affected. Vaccine hesitancy was an important cause in each of the affected countries.[70](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r70) This factor also contributed to the more than 100,000 measles cases in Europe in 2019 and the increased number of measles cases in the United States almost 20 years after the declaration that the disease had been eliminated in 2000.[71](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r71) In 2019, vaccine hesitancy was recognized by the WHO as one of the top 10 challenges to global health.[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r1) Since 2019, no WHO region has achieved and sustained elimination of measles.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic worsened the situation by interrupting routine immunization and catch-up campaigns. During the pandemic, global coverage of first measles vaccines decreased to 81%, the lowest level since 2008. Coverage has improved slightly, to 83% in 2022 and 2023.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) Low- and middle-income countries have the lowest coverage of first measles vaccines — 64% in low-income countries and 86% in middle-income countries.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) A recent analysis of county-level rates of measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccinations in 37 U.S. states shows that coverage was below 95% in 990 of 1501 counties and below 74% in 70 counties.[72](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r72)\n\nThis poor coverage has sparked large measles outbreaks in several countries since early 2024, and measles is now spreading widely. In 2024, the European region reported the highest number of measles cases in more than 25 years, accounting for 20% of the total measles cases worldwide.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r2) In the United States, as of May 30, 2025, 1088 confirmed measles cases and 3 deaths have been reported; 96% of those measles cases involved persons who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. In approximately 12% of reported cases, the infected persons were hospitalized.[73](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r73) The current number of cases is already approximately four times as high as the total reported in 2024. If measles outbreaks continue to spread through the United States for more than 12 months, the country will lose its elimination status.\n\nMisinformation suggesting that measles vaccine causes autism and that vitamin A prevents measles has been a serious threat to effective measles control and management in the United States and worldwide. More than 25 years ago, a campaign of misinformation suggesting that measles vaccine causes autism led to loss of confidence in MMR vaccines, especially in the United Kingdom.[74](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r74) This misinformation has been thoroughly investigated and proved to be incorrect. In the United States, the recent decrease in childhood vaccinations has been associated with vaccine hesitancy. Estimates suggest that a 10% decrease in MMR vaccination in the United States may lead to 11.1 million measles cases over a period of 25 years.[75](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r75)\n\nThe withdrawal of the United States from global public health initiatives and from support of global immunization programs is having a profound effect on measles control worldwide. Specifically, removal of support for the WHO, for which the United States contributes 19% of the budget, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for which it contributes 13% of the budget, will probably affect measles control and contribute to a large number of deaths from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the poorest countries.[76](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r76) As a result, the outlook for measles control in the coming years is bleak. This situation puts U.S. domestic health security at high risk, because infectious diseases do not respect geographic borders.\n\nIn the context of increased international travel, rapid identification of measles cases and genotyping of measles virus are crucial for early detection of outbreaks, tracking of transmission chains, and effective outbreak control. Updates on measles diagnostic and molecular genotypes are provided in the [Supplementary Appendix](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap1).\n\n## Conclusions and Perspectives\n\nThere has been little improvement in global measles control over the past two decades. With a declining environment for global health ( [Figure 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f2)), it is possible that the situation will get worse. Estimates of measles morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine hesitancy are needed to help contain vaccine hesitancy. Enhanced research during measles outbreaks is crucial to address population immunity gaps and improve vaccine coverage in the current measles vaccination program. Rapid diagnostic tests could be used routinely as part of measles global surveillance and could improve the timing of measles outbreak responses.[77](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r77)\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/640a0d91-5511-4dac-a546-f7c060be4566/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_f2.jpg)\n\nKey Events in Measles Research.\n\nCovid-19 denotes coronavirus disease 2019, EPI Expanded Programme on Immunization, LMICs low- and middle-income countries, MMR measles–mumps–rubella, SLAM signaling lymphocytic activation molecule, UNICEF United Nations Children’s Fund, and WHO World Health Organization.\n\nPostmeasles pneumonia has been shown to be largely due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_. The use of a booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for patients recovering from measles to help overcome temporary immunologic amnesia and possibly prevent fatal postmeasles pneumonia is a potential strategy. Clinical trials are needed to determine the appropriate time to administer pneumococcal conjugate vaccine during measles recovery.\n\nMeasles disease is most severe in young infants. Studies from West Africa have shown that measles vaccine can be highly effective, even when it is given as early as 4 months of age.[62](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r62) This finding needs to be reevaluated in the modern era.\n\nEfforts have been made to improve vaccine delivery[78](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r78) and storage.[79](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r79) Microneedle patches have been developed that offer the possibility of providing vaccination against measles and other conditions in remote areas where cold-chain transport is difficult. Microneedle patches also provide a pain-free, simplified method of vaccine administration. This innovation may help to improve vaccination coverage and reduce cold-chain issues. Additional randomized, controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of microneedle patches. In addition, further research on new measles vaccine candidates that can be given to younger infants is needed, because such vaccines may be required for eradication of measles.[80](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r80)\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article was published on June 25, 2025, and updated on July 9, 2025, at NEJM.org.\n\n[Disclosure forms](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap2) provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nSupplementary Appendix(nejmra2504516\\_appendix.pdf)\n\n- [Download](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/suppl_file/nejmra2504516_appendix.pdf)\n- 130.27 KB\n\nDisclosure Forms(nejmra2504516\\_disclosures.pdf)\n\n- [Download](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/suppl_file/nejmra2504516_disclosures.pdf)\n- 174.45 KB\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLarson HJ, Gakidou E, Murray CJL.
