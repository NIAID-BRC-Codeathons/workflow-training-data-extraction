Clades Ia and Ib MPXV continue to circulate in the country.\n\nA downward trend in confirmed cases has been reported in Uganda in recent weeks. However, the country continues to experience a large outbreak, reporting close to 200 new confirmed cases per week.\n\nBurundi continues to observe fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per week, down from over 200 confirmed cases per week at the peak of the outbreak.\n\nSierra Leone continues to report a surge in the number of confirmed mpox cases observed over the past six weeks, with over 600 new confirmed cases reported during the most recent week, highlighting the rising transmission in the country. Currently available data indicate that the outbreak is largely occurring among young adults in urban contexts, concentrated in and around Freetown. Prior to this surge, only clade IIb MPXV had been detected, but efforts are underway to carry out genomic sequencing analysis for more recent samples. A WHO mission is underway to bolster the outbreak response.\n\nAustralia has reported its first case of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV, linked to travel to Thailand. Thailand has only reported travel-related cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV so far.\n\nThis report provides an overview of mpox vaccination in countries in the African Region, where to date more than 720 000 doses of MVA-BN vaccines have been administered in seven countries. Of all doses, $8 1 %$ have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where microplanning is ongoing to optimize use of the limited vaccine supply with targeted vaccination strategies.\n\n# In this edition:\n\nContextual description\n\nEpidemiological update Global monkeypox virus (MPXV) distribution Overview of mpox outbreaks by virus clade Global trends Laboratory-confirmed cases reported in Africa Focus on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (clade Ia & Ib MPXV) Other countries reporting cases of mpox due to clade I MPXV First case of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV reported in Australia Mpox vaccination in the African Region\n\n# Global operational updates\n\nEmergency coordination\n\nCollaborative surveillance\n\nCommunity protection\n\nSafe and scalable care\n\nAccess to and delivery of countermeasures\n\nMpox resources Annex 1.

This surveillance system collects data on confirmed and probable mpox cases and deaths reported by Member States to WHO or reported publicly through official Member State resources (webpages, surveillance dashboards, as well as epidemiological and situation reports). Given the limited access to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing of suspected cases in some settings, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO also reports suspected (clinically compatible) mpox cases which meet the country’s national clinical case definition for suspected mpox since the declaration of the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 14 August 2024.\n\nThe indicator of suspected cases should be interpreted with caution, as suspected cases that undergo testing are not removed from the overall count of suspected cases, independently from the test results. In the absence of more detailed information, it is currently not possible to correctly subtract confirmed cases from the total number of suspected cases reported; therefore, the confirmed cases represent a subset of suspected cases. The case definition for suspected mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be found here.\n\nInformation on operational updates has been provided by the global mpox incident management support team at WHO headquarters, and the information on imported cases is based on notifications received by WHO from Member States under the provisions of the International Health Regulations (2005).\n\nFor reference purposes, a summary of the latest WHO global mpox rapid risk assessment conducted in February 2025 can be found in Annex 1.\n\n# Epidemiological update 3, 4\n\n# Global monkeypox virus (MPXV) distribution\n\nAs of 18 May 2025, the distribution of reported MPXV clades by country of detection is shown in Figure 1. This information is compiled from genome sequencing conducted and reported via different sources, including openaccess databases, peer-reviewed publications, reports and direct communication to WHO, including through its Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).\n\nSince its first detection in September 2023, clade Ib MPXV has been detected in 30 countries (Figure 1). Eighteen of these countries have only ever reported travel-related cases, that is, infections in individuals who were exposed in countries with community transmission of clade Ib MPXV in Central or Eastern Africa, or who were contacts of travelers returning from these regions. Twelve countries have ever reported community transmission of this clade, 10 countries of which were still experiencing community transmission during the last six weeks.\n\nFigure 1.

This classification applies regardless of the total number of cases reported.\n\nCases linked to travel, if, within the last six weeks, all reported cases are either: individuals who traveled to a country with known mpox transmission, were likely exposed there, and were diagnosed upon return or arrival OR individuals who did not travel themselves but had direct contact with someone who traveled to an affected country where the exposure likely occurred.\n\nPreviously reporting cases, if no new cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV have been reported for a period of more than six consecutive weeks since the last case, regardless of the previous transmission classification. Transmission is in control phase6.\n\nUnknown transmission dynamics, if insufficient information is available to determine if cases are due to community transmission or linked to travel.\n\nFigure 2 provides an overview of the clade Ib MPXV transmission status across all countries that have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV to date.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where clade Ib MPXV originated, cases have been reported in 10 provinces: South Kivu, North Kivu, Kinshasa, Kasai, Tshopo, Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga, Mai-Ndombe, Lomami, and Kongo-Central. Within Africa, community transmission of clade Ib MPXV has also been reported in Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Zambia during the last six weeks. Countries which have previously reported cases but have not reported any cases within the past six weeks include Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nOutside Africa, 17 countries have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (12 cases), Germany (10 cases), India (10 cases), China (seven cases), Belgium (five cases), Qatar (five cases), Thailand (five cases), the United States of America (four cases), France (three cases), United Arab Emirates (two cases), Australia, Brazil, Canada, Oman, Pakistan, Sweden, and Switzerland (one case each). Only travel-related cases have been reported outside Africa during the past six weeks. For more details, please refer to the section on Other countries reporting cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV.\n\nFigure 2.

It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of outbreaks in all settings; rather, it highlights the main characteristics of some outbreaks and the affected populations. Although there is currently no documented difference in inherent transmissibility of different MPXV strains to date, they are affecting different populations in different settings, resulting in distinct outbreak dynamics.\n\n# Clade Ia MPXV\n\nClade Ia MPXV is found primarily in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in provinces where mpox is endemic and has increasingly been found in previously unaffected provinces in recent years, including the capital Kinshasa since 2023. Reporting of sporadic cases in neighbouring Central African Republic and in the Republic of Congo also continues. While the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic report a higher proportion of children among cases, in the Republic of Congo, most cases are among adults.\n\nPreviously, genomic sequencing analysis had indicated that clade Ia MPXV typically emerged in human populations through zoonotic exposure, leading to limited human-to-human transmission. Epidemiological data and phylogenetic analyses still suggest that many outbreaks of mpox due to clade Ia MPXV in endemic areas result from zoonotic spillover with secondary human-to-human transmission. However, there is emerging evidence of increasing sustained human-to-human transmission of one lineage of clade Ia MPXV from 2024, mainly through sexual contact, in Kinshasa. At least three other provinces in the country (Kongo-Central, Kwilu, and Kwango) have detected this lineage, suggesting continuing spread in the country, and three imported cases have recently been found in Ireland (one case) and China (two cases). Sustained human-to-human transmission of clade Ia MPXV has not yet been documented in the Central African Republic or in the Republic of Congo.\n\n# Clade Ib MPXV\n\nClade Ib MPXV is currently spreading predominantly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its neighbouring countries. In other countries where it has been reported, cases are primarily associated with international travel (Figure 2). To date, no human case of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV has been substantiated to result from animal exposure. Genomic sequencing data suggest that all cases detected to date are genomically linked to the strain detected for the first time in 2023 in South Kivu. Available evidence therefore suggests exclusive human-to-human contact transmission for this virus sub-clade.\n\nImported mpox has been confirmed among adults who travelled during their incubation period or with early symptoms and were diagnosed upon arrival in the reporting country. These individuals frequently reported sexual contact during their travels, with persons known or suspected to have mpox.\n\nOften introduced in new settings through sexual contact among connected sexual networks, clade Ib MPXV introductions can lead to broader outbreaks and evolving transmission patterns, including spread within households. This has resulted in a progressive shift in age and sex distribution of cases, with an increasing proportion occurring among children, and a bimodal distribution, with the highest incidence observed among young children and young adults.\n\n# Clade IIa MPXV\n\nOutbreaks of mpox linked to clade IIa MPXV in human populations are a concerning development, as this clade had previously mainly been detected in or linked to animals, including a recent outbreak among monkeys in Taï national park in Côte d’Ivoire and the 2003 outbreak among pet prairie dog owners in the United States of America linked to small mammals imported from Ghana. Since 2024, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Liberia have reported human mpox due to clade IIa MPXV in different locations, including their capital cities.\n\nIn these countries, mpox linked to clade IIa MPXV has been reported in adults and children, with many lacking a known epidemiological link. Limited epidemiological investigation has constrained understanding of the modes of transmission in these outbreaks and clade IIa MPXV infection in humans remains the least described in the scientific literature. Nonetheless, preliminary indications from genomic sequencing analysis suggest the occurrence of repeated zoonotic spillover events followed by limited secondary human-to-human transmission. While sexual contact transmission for this strain has not been documented, it is likely that all forms of close contact contribute to its spread, as with other MPXV strains.\n\nCo-circulation of clade IIa and clade IIb MPXV was first reported in 2024, in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Liberia.\n\n# Clade IIb MPXV\n\nMost mpox outbreaks in other parts of Africa and on other continents are due to clade IIb MPXV, a continuation of the multi-country outbreak that began in 2022. Most regions report circulation of clade IIb lineage B.1, while lineage A.1 continues to circulate in Nigeria, neighbouring countries, and some countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. The most affected population outside of Africa, where low levels of transmission are reported, continues to be men who have sex with men, primarily exposed through sexual contact. In instances where others have been affected, such as women and children, it has not led to sustained transmission. In western Africa, cases are reported in different age groups, and include males and females, highlighting potentially different transmission dynamics which are not fully understood.\n\nThe multi-country outbreak of mpox driven by clade IIb MPXV that began in 2022 showed that sexual contact can sustain community transmission of MPXV for long periods of time. Likewise, subclades Ia and Ib have also been shown to be spreading through sexual contact, and their transmission is being sustained in different settings. Much remains to be understood about transmissibility and sustainability of transmission through non-sexual direct physical contact for all clades. In settings where human-to-human transmission persists, it is likely driven by a combination of sexual, household, and community contact.\n\n# Global trends\n\nThis section is a monthly update of the global epidemiological situation, based on the most recent complete information from the mpox global surveillance system, as of the end of April 2025. Further details on global trends can be found on the online WHO dashboard.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 through 30 April 2025, a total of 142 151 confirmed cases of mpox, including 328 deaths, were reported to WHO from 133 countries/territories/areas (hereafter ‘countries’) in all six WHO Regions (Table 1). The global CFR among confirmed cases during this period is $0 . 2 %$ .\n\nA total of 3915 new confirmed cases were reported in April 2025, a $12 . 5 %$ decline from the previous month. Most cases in April 2025 were reported from the African Region $( 8 8 . 7 % )$ , followed by the European Region $( 7 . 5 % )$ and the Region of the Americas $( 2 . 3 % )$ . The South-East Asian Region and the European Region reported a monthly increase in cases for April 2025, compared to March 2025, with increases of $8 3 %$ and $1 . 7 %$ respectively. On the other hand, the Region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Western Pacific Region, and the African Region reported declines in cases in April 2025, by $72 %$ , $57 %$ , $4 8 %$ , and $7 . 7 %$ respectively.\n\nTable 1. Number of cumulative confirmed mpox cases and deaths reported to WHO, by WHO Region, from 1 January 2022 through 30 April $2 0 2 5 ^ { 8 }$ .\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WHO Region | confirmed cases | Total deaths among confirmed | New cases reported in March | New reported in A25ril | Monthly change in cases |\n| Ageion of the | 68 840 | 152 | 322 | 90 | -72.0 |\n| African Region | 35 833 | 135 | 3758 | 3470 | -7.7 |\n| European Region | 29 898 | 9 | 288 | 293 | 1.7 |\n| Western Pacific Region | 5645 | 15 | 93 | 48 | -48.0 |\n| South-East Asia Region | 1028 | 14 | 6 | 11 | 83.0 |\n| Eastern Mediterranean | 907 | 3 | 7 | 3 | -57.0 |\n| Region Total | 142 151 | 328 | 4474 | 3915 | -12.5 |\n\nFigure 3 shows that over the past 12 months (1 May 2024 – 30 April 2025), the number of confirmed mpox cases reported monthly in the WHO African Region has steadily plateaued over the last six months. The Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia Regions have been reporting the lowest number of cases, with the former observing an upward trend earlier in 2025, driven mainly by Gulf countries. In the European Region, the trend has been relatively stable in recent months, with an increase in the number of cases reported over the past two months. In the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific, rising trends earlier in 2024 have been followed by a drop in cases in recent months. Trends in all regions may be prone to surveillance and reporting biases.\n\nIn the last 12 months, a global average of about 3253 confirmed mpox cases per month has been reported. Most of them were reported by the African Region (28 973 confirmed cases), followed by the Region of the Americas (4891 confirmed cases), and the Western Pacific (2355 confirmed cases). Outside Africa, Spain reported the highest number of confirmed cases in April 2025 (93 confirmed cases).\n\n![](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/images/ea516fcc5ef2f187f06d0e54e046b802816b5a2392f99e35eacb7ed871d855b9.jpg)\n\nFigure 3.

The most affected country continues to be the Democratic Republic of the Congo (8084 confirmed cases, including 22 deaths)9 followed by Uganda (4972 confirmed cases, including 28 deaths)10, Sierra Leone (2648 confirmed cases and 14 deaths), and Burundi (988 confirmed cases, including no deaths) (Figure 4).\n\nOver recent weeks and based on confirmed cases reported, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo11, and Uganda continue to experience large mpox outbreaks, with Sierra Leone reporting the highest number of confirmed cases during the last six weeks (2511 confirmed cases), followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (1598 confirmed cases) and Uganda (1171 confirmed cases). On the other hand, Burundi, which experienced a large mpox outbreak during the first half of 2024 and early 2025, has been reporting fewer than 50 cases per week since February 2025, down from 200 cases per week at the peak of its outbreak.\n\nThis marks the first time Sierra Leone has reported the highest number of confirmed cases in the past six weeks. The abrupt surge in confirmed cases in the country reported in the last edition of this report has continued into its sixth week, with over 600 new confirmed cases reported during the last week alone. Prior to this surge, only clade IIb MPXV had been detected, but efforts are underway to carry out genomic sequencing analysis for more recent samples. Currently available data indicate that the outbreak is largely occurring among young adults in urban contexts, concentrated in and around Freetown.\n\nFigure 4.

Most sequenced samples from 1 October 2023 to 21 April $2 0 2 5 ^ { 1 2 }$ are from the provinces of Kinshasa and South Kivu. Although all provinces in the country have reported confirmed mpox cases during this period, no sequencing has been done for samples from three provinces: Haut-Lomami, Ituri, and Kasai Oriental. So far, clade Ib MPXV has been detected in 10 provinces, and in five of them, it is co-circulating with clade Ia MPXV (Figure 5). Sequencing data from the Kinshasa outbreak have revealed increasingly sustained human-tohuman transmission of clade Ia MPXV with high rates of APOBEC3-driven mutations. However, no such indications have been documented so far in the other provinces where clade Ia MPXV is circulating.\n\nThe current strategy for sequencing follows a convenience sampling approach, where PCR-positive samples reaching Kinshasa are prioritized. This allows good visibility of the situation in Kinshasa and provinces with better sample transportation systems but might bias the observed distribution of the virus strains by province.\n\nFigure 5. Geographic distribution of clade Ia and Ib MPXV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, by province, from 1 October 2023 to 21 April 202513\n\n![](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/images/1892c2e0dfaca2daa996189d5fb1f400ff53014194d1c979108d0ea4c427a5de.jpg)\n\nSource:MPXV genome sequences and metadata accessible from INRB, Genbank,and GISAID\n\nThe analysis of the epidemic trend of reported suspected mpox cases (left, Figure 6) shows that there was a notable rising trend in the second half of 2024, and the number of suspected cases reported per week has remained at a high level, ranging from 2000 – 3000 cases per week since then. The trends in reported confirmed cases (right, Figure 6) suggest a rising trend in 2024 followed by a decline since the start of 2025. The latter needs to be interpreted with caution, since it is heavily influenced by access to testing and confirmation in the country (top, Figure 7).\n\nFigure 6. Epidemic curves of suspected (left) and confirmed (right) mpox cases reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1 January 2024 – 11 May 202514.\n\n![](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/images/573bb96c58b120e13408ea555aa04476f51d7c43d9dd60fce5398c36cb2ee488.jpg)\n\nIn Figure 7 the sampling proportion is calculated by dividing the number of cases from whom clinical specimens were taken (as recorded in the national laboratory line list) by the number of suspected cases reported through the syndromic surveillance system. This metric combines data from two distinct sources and is used solely to estimate testing activity. Due to potential date misalignments and other discrepancies between the two databases, these estimates may vary from week to week and should be interpreted with caution. Test positivity is calculated as the proportion of positive PCR results among the total number of tests conducted for each geographic area. Although the number of confirmed cases has been on an overall downward trajectory during 2025 (right, Figure 6), the test positivity has remained stable at about $50 %$ during the same period (bottom, Figure 7). This suggests that the observed declining trend in confirmed cases reported in recent weeks is likely to be a result of decreased access to testing, rather than a true decline in mpox incidence which would have resulted in a decline in test positivity (with a true decline in cases, it would be expected that a higher proportion of suspected cases would be discarded following a negative test). Interpretation of trends in confirmed cases over time should, therefore, take into account trends in suspected cases, proportion of suspected cases tested, and test positivity over time.\n\n![](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/images/1c12deed9120f094bb4a5e66f6863cbae6920b710eaf9269ecbeedd697825c55.jpg)\n\nFigure 7.

Shaded area indicates the most recent 3 weeks ofdata,which may be incomplete and should be interpreted with care\n\nFurthermore, national trends should be interpreted in light of the varying epidemic dynamics at the subnational level. An analysis of the epidemic trend of reported suspected mpox cases in the 16 most affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows that these provinces have varying outbreak sizes, but for most of them, the number of cases reported in recent weeks appears to be relatively stable (Figure 8).\n\nAmong the provinces reporting only clade Ib MPXV, South Kivu continues to account for most suspected cases in the country, still typically reporting about 400 suspected cases per week. The reported number of weekly suspected cases has continued to decline in South Kivu since mid-October 2024, although the decline in reported cases after February 2025 should be interpreted with caution given the impact of the escalation of conflict in the province during this time on surveillance and response activities. With regards to North Kivu, the sudden increase in reported cases observed in the province during the initial weeks of 2025 has been attributed to a change in the province’s reporting practices, with both tested and untested suspected cases now included in the overall count of suspected cases, unlike in 2024, when the overall count of suspected cases only included the untested suspected cases. This makes the syndromic surveillance in North Kivu more comparable to that of other provinces in 2025. That notwithstanding, the trends in suspected cases in North Kivu have remained relatively stable in recent weeks. In Tanganyika province, there has been a surge in the number of suspected cases reported, attributed to an influx of displaced persons fleeing conflict in North and South Kivu.\n\nAmong the provinces in which only clade Ia MPXV has been detected, Sankuru has been reporting a rising number of cases in recent weeks. In Sankuru, the recent spike in suspected cases occurred in the context of intensified surveillance and active case search activities, suggesting that there has likely been under-detection of cases prior to these activities. In Equateur province, the province historically most affected by mpox in the country, the trend has been slowly declining over time since a significant outbreak in January 2024, with fewer than 100 suspected cases reported weekly in recent weeks.\n\nAmong provinces in which clades Ia and clade Ib MPXV have been detected, including Kinshasa province, the number of suspected cases reported each week has been relatively stable in recent weeks.\n\nThe epidemiological situation in the country remains concerning, since circulation of the virus continues countrywide, with several local flare ups of transmission.\n\nFigure 8.

The remaining 13 countries of a total of 29 countries that have ever reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV are not included and can be considered to be in the control phase of their outbreaks, if surveillance is deemed to be adequate.\n\nTable 2. Countries reporting active clade Ib MPXV outbreaks, according to confirmed cases reported to WHO, as of 21 May 2025\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Country | Cases since January 2024 | Cases in past six weeks | Transmission status | Additional notes |\n| Democratic Republic of the Congo | 22 260 | 1598 | Community transmission |  |\n| Uganda | 6324 | 1171 | Community transmission |  |\n| Burundi | 3934 | 183 | Community transmission |  |\n| Rwanda | 119 | 5 | Community transmission |  |\n| Kenya | 113 | 43 | Community transmission |  |\n| Zambia | 76 | 40 | Community transmission |  |\n| Congo | 60 | 3 | Community transmission |  |\n| United Republic of Tanzania | 43 | 9 | Community transmission |  |\n| South Sudan | 14 | 6 | Community transmission |  |\n| Malawi | 10 | 10 | Community transmission |  |\n| The United Kingdom | 12 | 1 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n| Germany | 10 | 2 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n| Thailand | 5 | 1 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n| France | 3 | 1 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n| United Arab Emirates | 2 | 1 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n| Switzerland | 1 | 1 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n| Australia | 1 | 1 | Cases linked to travel |  |\n\nNote:\n\nImported cases are updated as of 21 May 2025 whereas case counts for countries classified as community transmission are updated as of 18 May 2025.\n\nFor countries classified as having cases linked to travel, only cases of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV are included. Cases in these countries for which clade and subclade classification is not determined or pending are not included.\n\nCountries with cases linked to travel also include instances where one to two generations of onward transmission have been reported and linked to index cases.\n\nCases reported in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are known to be a mix of clade Ia and clade Ib MPXV.\n\n# First case of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV reported in Australia\n\nOn 15 May 2025, Australia notified WHO of the first confirmed case of mpox due to clade Ib MPXV detected in the country. The case is an adult male with a recent history of travel to Thailand, where he reported having had high-risk sexual exposure that likely led to infection.\n\nAfter his return to Australia, he developed symptoms consistent with mpox and sought medical attention. Testing of laboratory samples collected confirmed MPXV infection, and genomic sequencing analysis revealed clade Ib MPXV.\n\nUpon confirmation, the local public health authorities advised the patient to isolate at home and maintained regular follow-up and monitoring. The case investigation which followed identified no close contacts in Australia. Considering the rapidly initiated surveillance and response measures and findings of the case investigations, further local and international spread in relation to this case are considered unlikely.\n\nHowever, since all five confirmed cases reported in Thailand have so far been travel-related, this suggests potential undetected clade Ib MPXV transmission in high-risk sexual networks in Thailand. The Australia public health authorities have notified the Thailand public health authorities and investigations are underway in Thailand to identify the source of infection.\n\n# Mpox vaccination in the African Region\n\nAs of 20 May 2025, seven African countries have initiated mpox vaccination using MVA-BN vaccine. have been administered during the current outbreak response. Notably, $8 1 %$ of these doses have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the country reporting the highest number of cases.\n\nGiven the supply-constrained context of current outbreaks in Africa, WHO recommends the off-label use of a single dose or intradermal fractional dosing of MVA-BN vaccine. At its March 2025 meeting, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) re-emphasized the importance of dose-sparing strategies during times of vaccine shortages in outbreak response situations. This approach is also reflected in the recently updated Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) for mpox.\n\nBelow is a summary of countries that have started mpox vaccination, the number of doses administered to date, and the target populations:\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo: Vaccination began on 5 October 2024, with 586 199 doses administered to date. During phase 1 (October 2024 – 21 February 2025) a two-dose regimen was administered to individuals aged 18 years and older targeting healthcare and frontline workers, contacts of mpox cases, and key populations including sex workers, men who have sex with men, hunters, and eco-guards/wildlife-rangers. In phase 2 (from 22 February 2025 onwards), the country shifted to a single-dose strategy for individuals aged 1 year and above; this strategy was deployed in the 15 most affected health areas (of 422) across five of 35 health zones in Kinshasa, while contacts of cases were also vaccinated outside of these areas. In view of the currently limited availability of vaccines in the country, the mpox vaccination strategy is being adapted to the context even further and microplanning is ongoing in several provinces. In April 2025, the Congo National Pharmacovigilance Center (CNPV) conducted training of enrollers who will conduct MVA-BN vaccine safety monitoring studies using a country-tailored WHO cohort event monitoring protocol.\n\nUganda: Since 2 February 2025, a total of 72 060 vaccine doses have been administered. Vaccination with single-dose MVA-BN focused on individuals aged 12 years or more from the following groups: key populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, bisexual, transgender, queer individuals), long-distance drivers, fishermen, health workers, and contacts of cases.\n\nRwanda: Since 17 September 2024, 12 518 doses have been administered. Target populations included individuals aged 18 years and older among health workers, contacts of cases, and other high-risk groups.\n\nNigeria: Since 25 November 2024, 7959 doses have been administered (4329 first doses and 3630 second doses) across six states. Vaccination targets individuals 18 years and older, including health workers, contacts of cases, and groups at risk of severe disease such as immunocompromised individuals. Currently, vaccination is on hold, pending availability of funds to continue activities.\n\nSierra Leone: Since 27 March 2025, 39 655 doses have been administered using a single-dose strategy. Target groups include individuals 12 years and older among health and frontline workers, sex workers, contacts of cases, and other high-risk populations (such as people living with HIV). Liberia: Since 16 April 2025, 2155 doses have been administered. Target groups include individuals 18 years and older, including health workers, contacts of cases, and other high-risk key populations.\n\nCentral African Republic: Since 18 January 2025, 100 doses have been administered, primarily to contacts of confirmed cases. Vaccination activities have been paused since no cases have been reported in the last weeks.\n\nOther countries in the African Region are expected to start mpox vaccination in the coming weeks.\n\n# Global operational updates\n\nThe WHO health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and resilience (HEPR) framework underpins both the Strategic Framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox (2024-2027) and the ongoing emergency response to the mpox public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).\n\nAligned with the HEPR framework, the updated WHO Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) for mpox focuses on strengthening five core components—the 5Cs:\n\n1. Emergency coordination: Efficient coordination for timely crisis response.\n2. Collaborative surveillance: Real-time data integration for early threat detection.\n3. Community protection: Engaging communities in prevention and resilience-building measures.\n4. Safe and scalable care: Equipping health systems to provide essential care with scalable capacity.\n5. Access to and delivery of countermeasures: Ensuring equitable distribution of medical\n\n   countermeasures.\n\nThis section provides updates on the WHO global mpox response as of 23 May 2025.\n\n# 1\\. Emergency coordination\n\nWHO and Africa CDC coordination for mpox response in Africa continues through the Continental Incident Management Support Team.\n\nPreparations are underway for the fourth meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the upsurge of mpox, scheduled for 5 June 2025.\n\nWHO work in health emergencies and a report on the implementation of the IHR (including the DirectorGeneral’s standing recommendations on mpox) were presented to the Seventy-eighth World Health Assembly, which ran from 19 – 27 May 2025.\n\n# 2\\. Collaborative surveillance\n\nUpdates to epidemiological data on mpox in Africa continue weekly, updates to global epidemiological data continue monthly, and both can be accessed in the online WHO dashboard.\n\nCoordination for laboratory diagnostics continues, with all partners supporting countries and across the three levels of the WHO, through the laboratory response pillar of the Africa continental Incident Management Support Team and monthly diagnostic consortium meetings.\n\nField evaluation of six antigen rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for mpox is ongoing in the Democratic Republic of Congo with the support of WHO. Once participant recruitment is completed, testing of the RDTs will commence.\n\nPerformance evaluation of selected PCR kits is planned to commence at the Robert Koch Institute (Berlin), WHO Collaborating Centre for emerging infections and biological threats in May 2025 to determine their limit of detection and assess ability to identify all clades currently circulating in different parts of the globe.\n\n# 3\\. Community protection\n\nCoordination across multiple technical areas including risk communication and community engagement, infodemic management, community-based infection prevention and control is ongoing. Community service delivery, public health and social measures, border health and mass gatherings, animal human interface and multisectoral action for social and economic protection are key areas of work.\n\nWHO held a second community of practice call, engaging Member States, operational partners, civil society and academia to explore the use of community data and evidence in health-decision making in mpox public health response.\n\n# 4\\. Safe and scalable care\n\nStrengthening of treatment facilities is ongoing in all affected countries, endeavouring to ensure that essential medicines and supplies are available and reach patients, including for IPC/Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).\n\nTechnical support to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in clinical care, including the design, set-up, and linkage of treatment centres, and writing and finalization of cascade training materials.\n\nWHO and Africa CDC jointly held a webinar on 20 May 2025 focused on shaping the future of mpox supportive care. The webinar provided insights on what’s working and what’s not working with regard to supportive case for mpox patients and explored what should be done to close the gaps in evidence for optimized mpox supportive care. Webinar participants provided feedback on what should be prioritized for the next phase of the clinical management guidelines for mpox.\n\nContinued support for the uptake of data collection tools to facilitate mpox clinical characterization using the WHO Global Clinical Platform. These include openly available tools developed in Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and Open Data Kit (ODK) data platforms. These are in use to understand the epidemic in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Uganda.\n\n# 5\\. Access to and delivery of countermeasures Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM)\n\n# Diagnostics:\n\nAs of 21 May 2025, two additional MPXV diagnostics, namely EasyNAT Monkeypox Virus Assay and PortNAT Monkeypox Virus Test manufactured by UStar Biotechnologies Ltd, have been included in the Emergency Use Listing for monkeypox virus in vitro diagnostics / nucleic acid amplification test. Since the call for expressions of interest under the WHO Emergency Use Listing procedure for MPXV diagnostics on 28 August 2024, 71 manufacturers have contacted WHO and 41 pre-submission calls have been scheduled. A total of 14 manufacturers were invited to submit their applications for 16 nucleic acid amplification assays.\n\nTo date, the WHO has listed six products under the Emergency Use Listing procedure, and nine products are currently under assessment. One application is expected in July 2025.\n\nWHO held a webinar on 19 May 2025 to inform new guidance on WHO post-prequalification and post-Emergency Use Listing listing change applications for in vitro diagnostics. Revised guidance, the application form for reporting changes and the webinar recording have been made available at PQ IVD webpage.\n\n# Vaccines\n\nWHO continues to provide strategic guidance, and technical support to accelerate implementation and uptake of mpox vaccination in affected countries for people at risk, in support of controlling the surge in mpox cases on the African continent.\n\nTo date, 1 332 280 vaccine doses have been delivered to eleven countries, including 50 000 doses of LC16m8 vaccine from Japan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in January 2025.\n\nVaccination activities have started in seven countries (the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda), several of which are implementing a single-dose strategy. Other countries seeking vaccine allocations are preparing national mpox vaccination plans.\n\nWHO recently published interim guidance on the use of LC16m8 vaccine and training modules with the aim to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo in planning the deployment of LC16m8 vaccine doses. WHO, UNICEF and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have published guidance on how to achieve and sustain high uptake of mpox vaccination in outbreak settings. The AAM partners continue to work together to ensure countries receive guidance to get operational funds for implementation of the national vaccination plans.\n\n# Mpox resources\n\nMpox outbreak toolkit WHO mpox outbreak toolbox, Updated May 2025.

Based on information available at the time of that risk assessment, the overall public health risk posed by mpox was assessed as follows:\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| Overall Public Health risk |\n| Global |\n| Moderate |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Overall global public health risk \\* |\n| Clade Ib MPXV | High |\n| Clade la MPXV\\*\\* | Moderate |\n| CladeIIMPXV (historically endemic areas) | Moderate |\n| Clade IIb MPXV\\*\\*\\* | Moderate |\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| Confidence in available information |\n| Global |\n| Moderate |\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| Confidence in available information |\n| Moderate |\n| Moderate |\n| Moderate |\n| Moderate |\n\n\\*All mpox outbreaks must be considered in their local context to gain a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology, modes of transmission, risk factors for severe disease, viral origins and evolution, and relevance of strategies and countermeasures for prevention and control.\n\n\\*\\*The situation in Kinshasa, however, requires particular attention. The risk associated with the clade Ia MPXV outbreak there is deemed higher than in clade Ia MPXV-endemic areas, with currently no evidence to suggest that clade Ia MPXV and clade Ib MPXV in the Kinshasa context19 are epidemiologically distinct.\n\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* This group represents a very broad geographic area, encompassing countries and regions with diverse health systems and varying response capacities. In certain countries or regional blocs within this group, the risk may vary and/or be assessed as low.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the risk groups:\n\nClade Ib MPXV - Mostly affecting non-endemic areas for mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries, where mpox is spreading mainly through human-to-human close physical contact, including sexual contact. International spread is predominantly linked to sexual contact: high. • Clade Ia MPXV - Mostly affecting mpox-endemic areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with sporadic cases reported in other Central and East African countries, where mpox is linked to zoonotic spillover events, as well as human-to-human transmission mainly through close physical contact, including sexual contact: moderate. Clade II MPXV (historically endemic areas) - Nigeria and countries of West and Central Africa where mpox is endemic, affecting children and adults, and is linked to zoonotic spillover events, as well as human-to-human transmission mainly through close physical contact, including sexual contact: moderate. Clade IIb MPXV\\*\\*\\*\\* - Global risk, where outbreaks predominantly affect adult men who have sex with men and spread predominantly through sexual contact: moderate.\n\nGiven the high likelihood that existing and new MPXV strains will continue to emerge and spread within human populations, and the potential consequences, the overall public health risk at the global level is assessed as moderate.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*This group represents a very broad geographical area, with countries and regions that have very diverse health systems and response capacities, and, in selected countries or regional blocs in this group, the risk may vary and/or be assessed as low.\n\nIndividual-level risk is largely dependent on individual factors such as exposure risk and immune status, regardless of geographic area, epidemiological context, biological sex, gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nIn this rapid risk assessment, public health risk is estimated based on the combination of the risk for human health, the risk for further spread and the risk of insufficient response capacities, in and from the affected areas. The way these risk estimates are presented may differ from the risk evaluations for clade Ia and clade Ib MPXV published in January 2025, which consider comparative characteristics of viruses, such as transmissibility, immune escape, severity and clinical/diagnostic considerations in a broader and more general context.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesize 40 years of evidence (1984-2024)\nto characterize Mpox epidemiology, vaccination gaps and clinical pattern in the Central African\nRepublic (CAR), informing targeted control strategies for this re-emerging threat.\nMethods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed,\nScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for studies reporting laboratory-confirmed Mpox cases\nin CAR. Pooled estimates were calculated using random/fixed-effects models with R Statistics\nversion 4.4.2 with subgroup analysis c onducted for period, region, participants and disease burden.\nHeterogeneity (I²) and publication bias (funnel plots, Egger's and Begg’s tests) were rigorously\nassessed. The confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated at 95% level of confidence.\nResults: Among 15 included studies representing 1984-2024 surveil lance data, the pooled severity\nrate was 60.9% (95%CI:47.5-72.8) - highest in Health Region 6 (77.3%, 95%CI: 55.6-90.2). The Case\nfatality rate (CFR) among confirmed cases was 10.9% (95% CI: 5.9-19.0). There was non-significant\ndecrease in CFR from 11.5%; (95% CI: 6.1-20.7) before 2022 to 7.14% (95% CI: 0.7-1.9) from 2022\non. There was a pers istent post-2022 CFR elevations in h igh-burden areas (13.5% for >10 cases).\nHigher mortality was observed in Eastern Health Regions (11.11%; 95% CI: 5.08-22.60) compared\nto Western Health Regions with no reported death. Among suspected cases, the CFR was 10.7%\n(95%CI: 6.6-17.0). Vaccination uptake was low (20.0%, 95%CI: 10.3-35.2). The clinical profile\nincluded fever (91.1%, 42.9-99.3), rash (85.5%, 95%CI: 75.7-91.8), lymphadenopathy (57.0%,\n95%CI: 34.3-77.1). Severe manifestations like hemorrhagic lesions (22.2%) and mucosal involvement\n(oral:59.2%; genital:57.4%) were also reported.\nConclusion: The CAR faces a disproportionate Mpox burden characterized by high severity,\nelevated mortality, and suboptimal vaccine coverage, particularly in eastern regions. These findings\nsuggest the urgent need for: (1) enhanced surveillance systems with genomic sequencing capacity; (2)\nprevention of disease lethality through early case detection and appropriate care provision; (3)\n .

In 2022, the World Health Org anization (WHO) declared Mpox a Public Health Emergency of\nInter national Concer n for the second time, confir ming its continued threat to global health security\nand underscoring the persistent risks posed by the disease \\[2\\]. As of May 2025, a total of 133\ncountries globally have notified 142,151 confir med Mpox cases with 328 deaths, yielding a case\nfatality rate (CFR) of 0.09% \\[3\\].\nBy June 2025, several African countries have re por ted community transmissi on of mpox due\nto clade Ib monkeypox vir us in the past six weeks \\[4\\]. T hese include Bur undi, the Democratic\nRe public of the Cong o, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Ug anda, and\nZambia, all of which are experiencing ong oing human-to-human transmission of the vir us. T he\nDemocratic Re public of the Cong o continues to re por t the highest number of confir med mpox\ncases in Africa in 2025 \\[ 5\\].

T h i s l a ck\nof access increases their susce ptibility to this reemerging disease \\[10\\].\nT he Central African Re public's (CAR) situation reg arding this outbreak is par ticularly sensitive\ndue to its socioeconomic and political condition. T he countr y is one of the least developed globally,\nwith decades of political instability, ar med conf lict, and widespread displacement severely impacting\nits socio-economic status \\[11\\]. T his has led to high levels of pover ty, food insecurity, and a significant\npropor tion of the population living in precarious conditions, often with limited access to basic\namenities like clean water and sanitation \\[12\\]. T hese socio-economic vulnerabilities can exacerbate\ndisease transmission and hinder effective public health responses, as communities often rely on\ntraditional healers and infor mal healthcare providers. T his reliance can delay diagnosis and\nappropriate manag ement of infectious diseases like Mpox \\[13,14\\]. In this case, prevention remains\none of the key strategies to control the spread of the disease within hotspots and across the countr y.\nT he implementation of Mpox vaccination activities could be an effective way t o respond to\nthis outbreak by vaccinating populations most at risk of contracting Mpox \\[15,16\\]. T his includes\nindividuals living in close proximity to wildlife reser voirs, par ticularly in forested, r ural, and remote\nareas that experience a severe shor tag e of qualified health personnel, medical supplies, and diagnostic\ncapabilities \\[8\\].\nMost previous studies on Mpox in CAR were conducted with small sample sizes, thereby\nlimiting the g eneralizability of their findings across the countr y \\[8,17–19\\]. Understanding the\nevolution of this disease and its regional distribution in this intricate setting is essential for designing\nand implementing effective Mpox prevention and control strategies tailored to the realities of the\nCAR. T herefore, this study aimed to provide insight into the e pidemiological and clinical profile of\nthe multiple Mpox outbreaks re por ted in CAR.\nMethods\nStudy design\nT his is the first systematic review and meta-analysis providing insight on the clinical and\ne pidemiological profile of Mpox in CAR from 1984 to 2024.

T he search approach involved the title and abstract screening of each\nstudy. A synthesis of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) vocabular y was utilized,\nemploying Boolean logic operators to nar row the search for each database used (Additional File 1,\nSupplementar y Table 2). To ensure thoroughness, a supplementar y manual searching was conducted\nto identify additional relevant publications not found in electronic databases. Additionally, the\nreference lists of included studies were reviewed to identify fur ther relevant ar ticles. Literature search\nwas concluded on Febr uar y 27, 2025.\nStudy setting\nT he CAR is a landlocked nation situated in the hear t of Africa, with an estimated population of 6\nmillion inhabitants in 2024 \\[21\\]. Most of its population (62%) lives in r ural ar eas, with women being\nthe most re presented (50.9%). T he countr y covers an area of 623,000 km² and is bordered to the\nNor th by Chad, to the East by South Sudan and the Re public of Sudan, to the South by the\nDemocratic Re public of Cong o and the Re public of Cong o, and to the West by Cameroon \\[22\\].\nAdministratively, the countr y is divided into seven Health Regions, 20 Divisions, 85 Sub-divisions,\n177 Councils, and around 8,302 villag es. T he capital, Bangui, has 10 Sub-divisions \\[23\\]. T he CAR is\ncharacterized by diverse g eog raphical features, ranging from dense rainforests in the south to savanna\nand semi-arid zones in the nor th \\[24\\]. T his varied landscape, coupled with a predominantly r ural\npopulation, inf luences human-animal interactions.\nEligibi lity criteria\nT his systematic review and meta-analysis encompassed all peer-reviewed published re por ts,\nreg ardless of study type or design, which documented Mpox in CAR. We excluded studies without\nclearly defined outcome variables. Duplicate ar ticles were identified by title and abstract screening\nand subsequently removed p r i o r t o d ata extraction.

Two authors\ninde pendently assessed each ar ticle for quality and relevance. Discre pancies between reviewers were\nresolved through discussion with a third reviewer to achieve consensus.\nData quality assessment\nT he quality of included studies was assessed using the Joanna Brig gs Institute quality assessment tool\nfor case re por ts, case series g enerated following outbreak sur veillance and investig ations activities\n\\[25\\]. Risk of bias was evaluated using eight to ten criteria, de pending on the study design. A binar y\nscore of 0 (no or unclear) or 1 (yes) was given after evaluation of each criterion. T he overall risk of\nbias was categ orized as low (>50%), moderate (>25-50%), or high (≤25%).\nOutcome measurement\nT he primar y outcomes of this systematic review and meta-analysis were Mpox severity and CFR.\nT he secondar y outcomes included the vaccination uptake and the clinical manifestations among\nsuspected and confir med cases. Mpox severity rate was deter mined by calculating the propor tion of\npar ticipants exhibiting severe or g rave c l i n i c a l manifestations of Mpox out of the total number of\nconfir med cases. CFR was calculated by dividing the number of deaths obser ved within the\npopulation of suspected or confir med cases. T he Mpox vaccination uptake rate/coverag e was\nobtained by dividing the total number of people who received t he vaccine by the number of eligible\npar ticipants. T he frequency of each clinical manifestation was computed by dividing the number of\nevents of each re por ted symptom or obser ved sign by the number of suspected or confir med cases.\nOperational definition\nA suspected monkeypox case was defined as an individual presenting with a vesicular or pustular rash\ncharacterized by dee p-seated, fir m pustules, and at least one of the following symptoms: fever\npreceding the er uption, lymphadenopathy (inguinal, axillar y, or cer vical), or pustules or cr usts on the\npalms of the hands or soles of the feet. A case was defined as laborator y-confir med Mpox if at least\none specimen yielded a positive result in the Or thopoxvirus-specific assay, Mpox-specific real-time\npolymerase chained reaction, or Mpox in culture \\[26,27\\]. Cases were classified as severe or g rave\n(requiring hospitalization) if one or more of the following were present: extensive lesions (>100),\nhemor rhagic or pustular lesions, mucosal involvement (oral, g enital, conjunctival), or systemic\ncomplications.

It was\ncateg orized as low (<25%), moderate (25−75%), or high (>75%). Subg roup analyses were conducted\nfor temporal trends (study period), g eog raphical disparities (study location), and disease burden. T he\ndisease burden cutoff was set based on the median of suspected or confir med cases re por ted across\nincluded studies. A fixed-effect model was used when heterog eneity was <50%. Timeframes for this\nanalysis were defined based on the global outbreak that led to a heightened global response \\[30\\]. A p-\nvalue of <0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were perfor med using the 'meta' packag e in R\nStatistics version 4.4.2 \\[31\\].\nPublication bias and sensitivity test\nA visual analysi s using funnel plot was car ried out to assess publication bias. Absence of publication\nbias was assumed based on observed symmetr y of the inver ted funnel shape. To fur ther investig ate\npotential bias, Eg g er's reg ression and Beg g's rank cor relation tests were perfor med. Sensitivity\nanalysis was conducted by iteratively excluding one study at a time to assess the robustness of the\npooled estimate.\nResults\nFrom an initial search yielding 454 records (445 online, 9 from other sources), we removed 1 6\nduplicates and screened the remaining 438 by title/abstract and full text.

T hese results provide critical insights into the\ne pidemiological, clinical, and public health patter ns of the Mpox vir us in CAR.\nCase fatality and clinical severity\nIn this study, an obser ved CFR of 10.87% was re por ted. T his is markedly higher than figures\nre por ted in recent global outbreaks, where most studies re por ted CFR to remain consistently below\n1%\\[32–34\\]. T his high CFR is similar to earlier studies from the Democratic Re public of Cong o\n(DRC), where sur veillance between 2001 and 2013 revealed CFRs ranging from 6% to 10.6%,\npar ticularly in children and unvaccinated individuals \\[35,36\\]. Fur ther more, similar mor tality rates\nwere documented in the CAR during earlier outbreaks in the 1980s \\[37\\]. T he high CFR in CAR can\nbe attributed to factors such as the endemic circulation of the more vir ulent clade I Mpox vir us\namong CAR cases, limited healthcare access, poor health-seeking behavior, and frequent delays in\ncase detection and isolation, especially in r ural communities. T his highlights the need for\ncollaborative and resilient healthcare systems to reduce this mor tality.\nNotably, our analysis showed significantly higher CFRs in the Easter n Health Regions (9.30%;\n95% CI: 4.72–17.51) compared to the Wester n Regions (4.17%; 95% CI: 0.58–24.35), with elevated\nmor tality par ticularly concentrated in localities re por ting a higher burden of suspected cases. T hese\nareas overlap with regions most affected by the prolong ed conf lict following the 2013 ar m conf lict,\nsuch as Haute-Kotto, Vakag a, Mbomou, and Ouham \\[38\\]. T hese zones have experienced re peated\nar med violence, mass displacement, and targ eted attacks on health facilities, severely compromising\naccess to healthcare ser vices. Médecins Sans Frontières and other humanitarian ag encies have\nre por ted recur rent looting, destr uction of infrastr ucture, and withdrawal of essential health ser vices\nin conf lict-affected health districts such as Batang afo, Bambari, and Bang assou \\[39\\]. T he ong oing\ninsecurity continues to restrict healthcare workers' mobility and disr upt medical supply chains,\nfur ther impeding timely diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of Mpox cases.\n .

T his border region's dense forest\necosystems and local populations' de pendence on hunting, g athering, and ag ricultural activities create\nfrequent human-animal interactions that facilitate zoonotic spillover \\[40\\]. T he combination of cross-\nborder movement and traditional livelihoods in these forested zones likely explains the elevated\nMpox transmission obser ved in these communities and subsequent likelihood of high severity in this\nsetting.\nAbout 61% of cases with clinical severity in CAR re por ted systems such as fever (91%), rash\n(86%), photophobia (89%), and fatigue (55%). T hese presentations are consistent with earlier\ndescriptions of Clade I infections, which are known to be responsible for systemic illness with\ncomplications such as secondar y bacterial infections, dehydration, and acute respirator y\ndistress\\[36,41\\]. T he WHO has previously characterized Clade I as causing more severe and\nwidespread disease, with a higher propensity for complications and mor tality compared to Clade IIa\nor IIb \\[42\\].\nOn the other hand, the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreaks, predominantly caused by Clade IIb, presented\nwith milder disease profiles. An extensive multinational cohor t study across 16 countries by\nT hor nhill et al. found that most patients exhibited localized anog enital lesions with minimal systemic\nsymptoms, and hospitalization was required in less than 10% of cases \\[33\\]. Si milarly, Tarín-Vicente et\nal \\[32\\] obser ved that although pain was a common symptom, especially with perianal lesions, life-\nthreatening complications were rare, and the CFR was negligible. T his phenotypic difference ref lects\nboth virological differences and contextual health infrastr ucture disparities across many countries,\nespecially in Africa, where timely access to quality and affordable healthcare remains limited in most\ncountries.\nAnother major challeng e in CAR is under re por ting, which underestimates the actual burden of\nMpox re por ted over the years. Rural communities often lack access to quality healthcare, including\ndiagnostic testing and trained personnel. Studies have highlighted that several cases may g o\nundetected for ever y confir med Mpox case in endemic areas due to inadequate sur veillance \\[43\\].\n .

T he low testing and\nre por ting rates hinder effective o utbreak response, delay contact tracing, and impair understanding\nof vir us evolution.\nOn the other hand, during recent outbreaks, a number of African nations have shown\nsuccessful testing and re por ting techniques. For example, Nig eria expanded molecular diagnostics\nthrough the Nig eria Centre for Disease Control during the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak, allowing for\nweekly situation re por ting and prompt case confir mation \\[45\\]. Similarly, real-time re por ting and\ntrend monitoring of monkeypox have been enhanced in the Democratic Re public of the Cong o\nthrough the implementation of sur veillance technologies such as DHIS2 and systematic case\nnotification \\[46\\].\nVaccination access and global inequity\nT he review showed a low vaccination uptake in CAR (20%). T hese results cor roborates finding from\nthe neighboring DRC \\[35\\]. T his could be due to supply limitations, healthcare infrastr uctural\nchalleng es, and vaccine hesitancy among the population. Historically, smallpox vaccination provided\ncross-protection ag ainst Mpox, with immunity estimates around 85% \\[48\\]. However, the cessation of\nglobal smallpox immunization in 1980 resulted in a g rowing cohor t of susce ptible individuals in\nendemic regions \\[49\\]. Countries like CAR, with weak immunization infrastr ucture, have since lacked\nroutine smallpox-derived protection and access to new Mpox-specific vaccines.\nIn contrast, during the 2022 outbreak, developed countries rapidly deployed targ eted\nvaccination campaigns. For example, the U.S. administered over 1.2 million doses of JYNNEOS by\nearly 2023 \\[50\\], prioritizing healthcare workers and most vulnerable g roups like men who have sex\nwith men. Similarly, the UK initiated a pre-exposure prophylaxis campaign using a ring vaccination\nstrateg y \\[51\\]. T hese discre pancies showed broader global health inequities in global vaccine\ndistribution effor ts and research funding towards endemic countries like CAR, which the Mpox\nmorbidity and mor tality have impacted for decades.\nStrength and limitations\nT his review has several limitations. First, some death cases might have been unre por ted due to study\ndesign, potentially underestimating the tr ue CFR. Confounding by strain differences remains a\nconcer n, as the lack of comprehensive g enomic data in many studies obscures the clade-specific\n .

Sur veillance bias, par ticularly the potential for improved d et e ct i o n o f m i lder cases in\nmore recent studies, may also inf luence the CFR estimates.

T he findings\nhighlight the continued public health impor tance of Mpox in the region and underscore the need for\nong oing sur veillance, research, and inter ventions to reduce the burden of this disease.\nConclusions\nMpox remains a major public health challeng e in the Central African Re public, with mor tality and\ndisease severity far exceeding those re por ted in recent non-endemic outbreaks. T his disparity is\nprimarily due to the circulation of the more vir ulent Clade I vir us and also ref lects limited healthcare\naccess, low vaccination coverag e, and underinvestment in sur veillance infrastr ucture. Future research\nin the countr y should explore and confir m these g aps in the manag ement of Mpox cases.\nConsequently, the inter national response to Mpox must address these str uctural inequities through\nenhanced resource allocation, targ eted vaccine deliver y, community education, healthcare worker\ntraining, and research par tnerships with endemic countries.\nAbbreviations\nCAR: Central African Re public\nCFR: Case Fatality Rate\nCI: Confidence Inter val\nDRC: Democratic Re public of Cong o\nHCW: Healthcare worker\nMeS H: Medical Subject Headings\nPRISMA: Prefer red Re por ting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis\nWHO: World Health Org anization\n .

Following its initial global spread in 2022, the current outbreak is driven by a newly emerged Clade I, exhibiting atypical clinical manifestations and altered transmission patterns. These changes, coupled with limited immunity in younger populations due to the absence of smallpox vaccination, underscore the severity. As of June 2024, nearly 100,000 cases have been documented worldwide, with Africa experiencing the majority of new cases, highlighting critical gaps in global health preparedness.\n\n### Methodology\n\nThis article provides an updated analysis of recent mpox cases, exploring the distinct epidemiological and clinical challenges of the current outbreak. It examines transmission patterns, affected demographics, and obstacles like underreporting to understand the evolving crisis.\n\n### Results\n\nThe current outbreak is primarily centered in the Democratic Republic of Congo but poses global transmission risks. The dominance of the more severe Clade I and a significant shift towards human‐to‐human transmission, predominantly through sexual contact (83.3% of cases in males aged 29–41), characterize its epidemiology. Inadequate surveillance and underreporting, particularly in low‐resource settings, obscure the true extent of the outbreak. The analysis reveals the urgent need for a coordinated, multisectoral global response.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMpox outbreak underscores critical deficiencies in global health preparedness. An effective response requires an evidence‐based, coordinated approach, integrating technical, social, and financial resources internationally and locally. Key recommendations include strengthening surveillance, improving diagnostics, enhancing equitable vaccine accessibility, and implementing robust anti‐stigma initiatives at all levels. An inclusive, multisectoral collaboration between governments, international organizations, and community leaders is crucial to mitigate the public health, social, and economic impacts of this persistent outbreak.\n\n**Keywords:** global threat, mpox, response strategies, surveillance, urgent call\n\n## 1\\.

However, a significant shift occurred in May 2022, when mpox cases began spreading across multiple non‐endemic regions, eventually leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on June 23, 2022 \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0001), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0003)\\]. By the end of October 2022, 76,871 cases had been reported across 19 non‐endemic countries, highlighting the rapid and unexpected global spread of the virus \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0003)\\]. The mpox virus comprises two major clades: Clade I (Congo Basin) and Clade II (West African). Historically, Clade I is known for causing more severe symptoms and higher mortality rates, while Clade II is associated with milder infections \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0003)\\]. However, the current outbreak has seen the emergence of a new clade, exhibiting atypical clinical symptoms, such as dermatological, neurological, and respiratory manifestations. These unusual symptoms and recent transmission patterns—often linked to close‐contact behaviors, including sexual contact in men who have sex with men—represent a significant epidemiological shift \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0004)\\]. The outbreak also reflects the impact of limited immunity due to the absence of smallpox vaccination coverage in younger populations \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0005)\\].\n\nBetween January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024, the WHO documented 99,176 cases across 116 countries. June 2024 alone saw 934 new cases, with Africa accounting for 61% of these cases, followed by 19% in the Americas and 11% in Europe \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0006)\\]. This resurgence highlights critical gaps in global health preparedness, with the persistence and evolution of mpox underscoring the need for enhanced surveillance, diagnostic innovations, and international cooperation to prevent further spread.\n\n## 2\\. Current Situation and Key Challenges\n\nThe current mpox outbreak presents unique challenges that demand urgent attention. The DRC remains the epicenter, contributing 96% of confirmed cases, with neighboring countries such as Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and Kenya now reporting their first cases \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0007)\\]. Although Africa is the most affected, cases in the Americas, Europe, and other regions indicate global transmission risks \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0004), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0008)\\]. Epidemiologically, the 2024 outbreak has been dominated by Clade 1, known for its higher severity compared to Clade 2. This clade's rapid spread and more severe clinical outcomes have heightened public health concerns \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0003)\\]. In contrast to earlier outbreaks primarily linked to animal contact, recent cases are increasingly driven by human‐to‐human transmission, especially through sexual contact \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0007)\\]. A significant 96.4% of confirmed cases are in males aged 29–41, with 83.3% of transmissions occurring via sexual contact. While transmission is linked to a sexual contact, it can still affect a diverse population. The outbreak has also affected children, particularly in the Americas, though they constitute a smaller proportion of cases. The limited immunity from past smallpox vaccinations in older adults further complicates the situation, leaving many populations vulnerable \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0006)\\]. Underreporting remains a significant obstacle to effective outbreak management. Surveillance systems, particularly in low‐resource settings, are inadequate, leading to gaps in data collection and underestimation of case numbers. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases often go undetected, contributing to the silent spread of the virus. The focus on symptomatic cases also limits our understanding of the true extent of the outbreak, emphasizing the need for more robust and comprehensive surveillance mechanisms \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0009)\\].\n\n## 3\\. Call to Action\n\nThe ongoing mpox outbreak demands a swift and decisive global response. Current control measures have proven insufficient, necessitating a reassessment and revision of strategies \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0009)\\]. A critical priority is the allocation of more resources, including increased funding, expanded vaccine access, and the deployment of trained personnel, especially in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0010)\\]. Ensuring equitable vaccine distribution is essential to protect high‐risk populations and prevent further spread. Enhanced global coordination is vital to harmonizing response efforts across countries \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0011)\\]. This includes standardized guidelines for case management, improved communication channels, and stronger international partnerships. Surveillance systems must be strengthened to capture more accurate data, including asymptomatic cases, which are crucial for controlling transmission. The global community should also prioritize the development of targeted interventions for populations disproportionately affected by the outbreak, such as sex workers, high‐risk adults, and vulnerable groups in endemic regions \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0012)\\]. Additionally, public health messaging should focus on reducing stigma and discrimination associated with mpox, particularly in communities where transmission is linked to sexual behavior \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0005)\\]. This stigma, which parallels that seen during the early HIV epidemic, can create barriers to accessing healthcare and adhering to preventive measures. Effective interventions must occur at multiple levels—policy, healthcare organization, and community—to reduce discrimination and promote equitable care. To avoid stigmatizing specific populations, public health messaging should focus on promoting understanding of mpox transmission and symptoms without reinforcing biases. Community‐based education campaigns, inclusive messaging, and policy‐level initiatives aimed at protecting affected populations are critical in fostering cooperation with public health measures \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0013)\\].\n\nAddressing these social determinants of health is essential to improving public trust and compliance with outbreak response strategies \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230339/#hsr270940-bib-0014)\\].\n\n## 4\\. Conclusion\n\nThe 2024 mpox outbreak has underscored critical deficiencies in global health preparedness and response. Addressing these gaps requires an evidence‐based, coordinated approach that combines technical, social, and financial resources across international and local levels. Strengthening surveillance, improving diagnostics, enhancing vaccine accessibility, and fostering anti‐stigma initiatives are necessary to protect vulnerable populations and prevent future resurgences. An inclusive, multisectoral response that leverages collaboration between governments, international organizations, and community leaders is essential to mitigate the public health, social, and economic impacts of this outbreak.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\n**Majani Edward:** conceptualization, writing – original draft, writing – review and editing, supervision, and investigation. **Grace Gwanafyo:** writing – original draft and investigation. **Eliza Kimambo:** writing – original draft and investigation. **Daniel Basaya:** investigation and writing – original draft.\n\n## Ethics Statement\n\nThe authors have nothing to report.\n\n## Consent\n\nThe authors have nothing to report.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Transparency Statement\n\nThe lead author, Majani Edward, affirms that this manuscript is an honest, accurate, and transparent account of the study being reported; that no important aspects of the study have been omitted; and that any discrepancies from the study as planned (and, if relevant, registered) have been explained.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nThe data presented in this article are derived from publicly available reports and analyses from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and other referenced epidemiological sources.

Current public health strategies in Africa fall short due to fragmented surveillance systems, delayed diagnostic capabilities, and inadequate resource distribution networks that cannot effectively respond to rapidly evolving outbreaks in remote and underserved areas. This narrative review explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the management and control of Mpox in Africa. AI technologies, including machine learning and predictive analytics, can significantly improve early detection, surveillance, contact tracing, case management, public health communication, and resource allocation. AI-driven tools can analyze large datasets to identify outbreak patterns, automate contact tracing through mobile data, optimize treatment plans, and tailor public health messages to specific communities. However, the successful implementation of AI faces challenges, including limited digital infrastructure, data quality issues, ethical concerns, and the need for capacity building. Furthermore, ongoing research is essential to refine AI algorithms and develop culturally sensitive applications. This review emphasizes the need for investment in infrastructure, training, and ethical frameworks to fully integrate AI into public health systems in Africa. By addressing these challenges, AI can play a pivotal role in mitigating the impact of Mpox and enhancing the resilience of healthcare systems against future infectious disease outbreaks. This represents a novel comprehensive synthesis of AI applications specifically for African Mpox control, providing a critical framework for evidence-based implementation strategies in resource-limited settings.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001776)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001375)\n\n## Keywords\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nMpox\n\nDisease Outbreak\n\nZoonotic Diseases\n\nDisease Surveillance\n\nInfectious Diseases\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nMpox is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, a member of the _Orthopoxvirus_ genus, which also includes the variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox ( [World Health Organization, 2024a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib113)). Formerly called \"monkeypox\", it was renamed in November 2022 by the WHO to avoid stigma and negative impacts on trade, travel, tourism, and animal welfare ( [World Health Organization, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib112)). It was first discovered in laboratory monkeys in 1958, with the first human case recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), and Mpox has become a public health concern in Central and West Africa ( [Dou et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib33), [Harapan et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib44), [Jezek et al., 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib48)). It is typically transmitted to humans through contact with the bodily fluids, skin lesions or respiratory secretions of infected animals ( [Bunge et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib24)), with rodents suspected to be the primary reservoir ( [Ullah et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib102)).\n\nMpox shares clinical symptoms with smallpox, but it is generally milder, presenting with fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy ( [Yu et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib119)), with the possibility of complications such as secondary bacterial infections, respiratory distress, and encephalitis ( [Anil et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib10)). While smallpox was eradicated globally in 1980, Mpox remains endemic in Africa, with periodic outbreaks historically confined to remote areas ( [Dou et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib33), [Olawade et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib72)). However, recent Mpox trends in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#fig0005) has shown infection in urban areas and international spread, including the United States and Europe, raising concerns about its global threat ( [World Health Organization, 2024a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib113)). The Figure indicates that the African and South-East Asia regions have significantly higher Mpox mortality rates than other regions.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0166093425001636-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

Mpox trends across the WHO regions from January 2022 to May 2025.\n\nIts primary transmission spread is through direct contact with infected animals or humans, contaminated materials, or respiratory droplets. The incubation period for Mpox ranges from 6 to 13 days but can extend from 5 to 21 days ( [Bunge et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib24)). Clinically, Mpox is characterized by a prodromal phase of fever, malaise, headache, and muscle aches, followed by a rash that typically starts on the face and spreads to other body parts, progressing through various stages before crusting ( [Anil et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib10)). Most cases resolve in 2–4 weeks, but severe illness is more common in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals. The case fatality rate of Mpox varies across outbreaks, ranging from 1 % to 10 %, with the highest mortality observed in the Central African clade of the virus ( [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib27)).\n\nMpox resurgence has underscored several public health challenges, especially in Africa in where inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited trained personnel hinder the effective detection, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease ( [Olawade et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib72), [World Health Organization, 2024a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib113)). Socioeconomic factors like poverty, bush meat consumption, and human-animal contact increase the risk of zoonotic transmission ( [Hayman et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib45)). Limited access to smallpox vaccines and antiviral medications, logistical barriers in remote areas, and low public awareness further complicate the control effort taken to mitigate the Mpox spread ( [Alakunle et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib4), [Watarkar et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib109)). Summarily, [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#tbl0005) presents Mpox trends in selected African countries from 1970 to 2021, as reported by [WHO, (2024e)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib110), indicating that the disease is endemic in the central and western African regions.\n\nTable 1. Trends of global Mpox cases reported in selected African countries from 1970 to 2021.\n\n| **Africa** | **Years- 1970 to 2021** | **Confirmed cases** | **Number of deaths** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Benin | 1978 | 1 | 0 |\n| Cameroon | 1979–2021 | 11 | 0 |\n| Central African Republic (CAR) | 1984–2021 | 105 | 12 |\n| Congo | 2003–2019 | 22 | 7 |\n| Cote d’Ivoire | 1971–1981 | 2 | 0 |\n| Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) | 1970–2011 | > 18,515 (suspected and confirmed) | 516 |\n| Gabon | 1987 | 5 | 2 |\n| Liberia | 1970 and 2017 | 6 | 0 |\n| Nigeria | 1971–2021 | 228 | 9 |\n| Sierra Leone | 1970–2021 | 5 | 1 |\n| South Sudan | 2005 | 10 | 0 |\n\nIn this challenging context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a promising avenue for improving the management of Mpox outbreaks. AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics, all of which have potential applications in public health ( [Alowais et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib8)). While AI has been utilized in the surveillance, prediction, and control of other infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, and COVID-19, its application to Mpox remains in the early stages ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)). Nevertheless, AI offers significant potential for developing novel strategies to combat this disease. AI can enhance Mpox management in several key areas as highlighted in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#fig0010). First, AI-driven surveillance systems can improve the detection and monitoring of outbreaks by analyzing large datasets from diverse sources, such as electronic health records, social media, and environmental sensors ( [Setegn and Dejene, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib86); [Thakur, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib97), [Thakur et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib98)). These systems can identify patterns and predict the spread of the virus, enabling public health authorities to respond more rapidly and effectively ( [Zhao et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib123)). Second, AI can optimize resource allocation, ensuring that vaccines, antiviral drugs, and personal protective equipment are distributed to the areas where they are most needed ( [Persad et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib83)). Third, AI can improve communication strategies by tailoring public health messages to different populations, combating misinformation, and promoting adherence to prevention measures ( [Edinger et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib35)). Additionally, AI can contribute to developing new diagnostic tools and treatments for Mpox. Machine learning algorithms can identify biomarkers associated with severe disease, aiding in the early identification of high-risk patients ( [Al-Tashi et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib9)). AI can also accelerate the discovery of new antiviral drugs and the development of more effective vaccines, providing critical tools to reduce the burden of Mpox in Africa and beyond ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)).\n\n![Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0166093425001636-gr2.jpg)\n\n1.

Potential applications of AI in the management of the Mpox outbreaks.\n\nWhile AI holds global promise, its application in the African context, where Mpox is most endemic, requires tailored strategies ( [Abdelouahed et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib1)). The effectiveness of AI-driven public health tools hinges on their cultural and infrastructural adaptability. Public trust and cultural beliefs about disease, health systems, and technology vary widely across African regions. To foster acceptance, AI-enabled interventions must be co-developed with local stakeholders, including community leaders and healthcare workers, to ensure culturally sensitive communication and ethical data use ( [Alaran et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib5)). Moreover, challenges such as limited internet connectivity, inconsistent electricity supply, and varying levels of digital literacy can impede the deployment of high-tech solutions ( [Yu et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib119)). Therefore, AI systems designed for Mpox management in Africa should prioritize mobile accessibility, low-bandwidth functionality, and offline capabilities. Community engagement, capacity building, and investment in digital infrastructure are also critical to enhancing local ownership and long-term sustainability of AI-based interventions ( [Abdelouahed et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib1)).\n\nThe rationale for this review lies in the urgent need to explore innovative solutions, such as AI, that can enhance the effectiveness of current public health strategies. The novelty of the review stems from its focus on the application of AI technologies, such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing, in the specific context of Mpox management, a relatively underexplored area. The review's objectives are to assess AI's potential to improve disease surveillance, optimize resource allocation, enhance public health communication, and support the development of diagnostic and treatment tools for Mpox in Africa, ultimately contributing to more effective outbreak control and prevention efforts.\n\n### 1.1. The AI-enhanced Mpox management strategy\n\nThe \"Mpox strategy\" referenced throughout this article represents a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach that leverages artificial intelligence to transform traditional disease control paradigms for Mpox management in African contexts. This strategy encompasses five core components: (1) intelligent surveillance systems utilizing advanced biosensors and machine learning algorithms for early detection, (2) predictive modeling frameworks for outbreak forecasting and resource optimization, (3) automated contact tracing and case management systems, (4) culturally-adaptive communication platforms, and (5) AI-driven logistics and supply chain optimization. The strategy builds upon recent advances in intelligent material systems and biosensing technologies that have demonstrated remarkable potential for infectious disease management.\n\nRecent developments in advanced functional materials have shown exceptional promise for Mpox detection and monitoring applications, particularly through the integration of smart materials with AI-driven diagnostic platforms that enable real-time pathogen identification and quantification ( [Asif et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib14): [Chaudhary et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib29)). These innovations complement advances in intelligent biosensing systems that combine machine learning algorithms with novel material properties to achieve unprecedented sensitivity and specificity in viral detection ( [Chaudhary et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib29), [Kumar and Singh, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib52)). Furthermore, miniaturized sensing platforms utilizing advanced nanomaterials have demonstrated the capability to provide point-of-care diagnostic solutions specifically tailored for resource-limited African settings, enabling rapid Mpox identification even in remote areas lacking traditional laboratory infrastructure ( [Thwala et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib99), [Cavuto et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib25), [Lakshmanan and Liu, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib53)).\n\nThis integrated strategy recognizes that effective Mpox control in Africa requires not merely technological solutions, but culturally-sensitive, locally-adapted AI applications that work synergistically with existing health systems. The strategy emphasizes human-AI collaboration, ensuring that technological interventions enhance rather than replace human expertise and community knowledge systems.\n\n## 2\\. Methodology\n\nThis narrative review was conducted following an adapted approach based on PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, modified for the narrative review format to enhance methodological transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### 2.1. Literature search\n\nThis comprehensive narrative review was conducted between June and August 2024, with the literature search covering publications from database inception through August 31, 2024. The search was systematically conducted across four major academic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. Additional grey literature sources were consulted, including reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), and relevant governmental health agencies.\n\nThe search strategy employed a four-tier approach combining: (1) core terms related to Mpox and monkeypox, (2) artificial intelligence and related technologies, (3) African context and public health applications, and (4) granular AI applications and digital health interventions. Specific search strings included:\n\n> Primary search string: (\"Mpox\" OR \"monkeypox\" OR \"MPXV\") AND (\"artificial intelligence\" OR \"machine learning\" OR \"AI\" OR \"deep learning\" OR \"neural networks\" OR \"predictive analytics\" OR \"natural language processing\") AND (\"Africa\" OR \"surveillance\" OR \"public health\" OR \"outbreak response\")\\*\n\n> Secondary search string: (\"infectious disease\" OR \"zoonotic disease\" OR \"viral outbreak\\*\") AND (\"AI\" OR \"artificial intelligence\" OR \"machine learning\" OR \"predictive model\\*\") AND (\"Africa\\*\" OR \"resource-limited setting\\*\" OR \"low-income countr\\*\")\\*\\*\n\n> Tertiary search string: (\"digital health\" OR \"health technology\" OR \"mHealth\") AND (\"disease surveillance\" OR \"contact tracing\" OR \"resource allocation\") AND (\"Africa\" OR \"sub-Saharan Africa\" OR specific African country names)\\*\n\n> Quaternary search string: (\"AI-driven diagnostics\" OR \"automated disease detection\" OR \"predictive analytics for outbreak response\" OR \"digital health interventions in Africa\" OR \"computer vision for disease detection\" OR \"automated contact tracing\" OR \"AI-powered surveillance systems\" OR \"machine learning algorithms for epidemic prediction\" OR \"digital biomarkers\" OR \"telemedicine applications\" OR \"health informatics in resource-limited settings\") AND (\"mpox\" OR \"monkeypox\" OR \"infectious disease surveillance\" OR \"public health emergency\") AND (\"Africa\" OR \"developing country\" OR \"resource-limited\" OR \"low-resource setting\\*\")\\*\\*\n\nBoolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) were strategically used to refine the search results and ensure comprehensive coverage of the literature. Wildcard symbols (\\*) were employed to capture variations in terminology. Reference lists of included studies were manually reviewed for additional relevant publications (snowball sampling), and citation tracking was performed using Google Scholar to identify more recent publications citing key articles.\n\nThe PRISMA framework was specifically adapted for this narrative review through several key modifications to accommodate the breadth and heterogeneity of AI applications in Mpox control. Unlike systematic reviews requiring strict inclusion criteria for homogeneous study types, our adapted approach incorporated a multi-tier screening process that allowed for the inclusion of diverse evidence types including peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, case studies, and policy documents. For the narrative synthesis, studies were continuously re-evaluated for relevance as emerging themes developed. Additionally, the data extraction process was expanded beyond traditional systematic review parameters to capture implementation contexts, technological specifications, and cultural adaptation requirements specific to African health systems. This adaptation ensured methodological transparency while maintaining the flexibility necessary for synthesizing complex socio-technical interventions across varied implementation environments.\n\n### 2.2. Study selection and screening process\n\nThe selection process involved a two-stage screening of titles, abstracts, and subsequent full-text articles against predefined criteria. Duplicates were removed using reference management software, and the reasons for excluding studies at the full-text stage were documented.\n\n### 2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nTo ensure the relevance and quality of the studies included in this review, comprehensive and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Studies were included if they met all of the following criteria: (1) focused on the application of AI or related digital technologies in the context of infectious disease management with particular emphasis on surveillance, prediction, or response systems; (2) discussed AI technologies in the context of disease surveillance, predictive modelling, resource allocation, public health communication, diagnostic support, or treatment strategies; (3) were peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, technical reports, or official reports published in English between 2018 and August 2024; and (4) provided insights into challenges and opportunities specific to Africa, or presented findings with clear applicability to African health systems, particularly in managing Mpox or similar zoonotic diseases. Additionally, studies were included if they addressed AI implementation in resource-limited settings with clear relevance to African contexts.\n\nStudies were excluded if they were (1) unrelated to AI or infectious diseases, (2) solely focused on non-African contexts without demonstrable relevance to African health systems, (3) opinion pieces without empirical data or substantial analytical content, or (4) published in languages other than English, (5) published before 2018 unless they represented seminal work in the field, (6) focused exclusively on non-communicable diseases without infectious disease relevance, or (7) studies with insufficient methodological detail to assess reliability and validity.\n\n### 2.4. Quality assessment\n\nA comprehensive quality assessment framework was developed specifically for this review, adapting established appraisal tools to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of AI-driven Mpox research. The framework integrated elements from the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists, and technology assessment frameworks to evaluate studies across multiple dimensions. The assessment criteria included: (1) methodological rigor (study design appropriateness, data collection methods, analytical approach), (2) technological validity (algorithm performance metrics, validation procedures, generalizability), (3) implementation feasibility (resource requirements, infrastructure dependencies, scalability), (4) cultural appropriateness (community engagement, local adaptation, ethical considerations), (5) reporting transparency (clear methodology description, limitation acknowledgment, replicability), and (6) African context relevance (applicability to resource-limited settings, consideration of local health systems). Each criterion was scored on a 3-point scale (high, moderate, low), with studies requiring a minimum aggregate score for inclusion. This tailored framework enabled systematic evaluation of diverse evidence types while maintaining scientific rigor appropriate to the emerging field of AI in African health systems.\n\nTo minimize biases, the review prioritized empirical studies with African data, included grey literature from reputable health organizations, and critically evaluated claims of AI effectiveness against reported implementation challenges. Where conflicting evidence existed, both perspectives were presented with explicit discussion of potential bias sources.\n\n### 2.5. Data extraction and analysis\n\nData from the selected studies were extracted using a standardised data extraction form designed specifically for this review. The extraction process involved the systematic collection of the following information:\n\n- •\nStudy characteristics (author, year, country/region, study design)\n\n- •\nAI technology type and specific applications\n\n- •\nTarget disease(s) and public health domain\n\n- •\nImplementation context (urban/rural, resource level)\n\n- •\nOutcomes and effectiveness measures\n\n- •\nChallenges and barriers identified\n\n- •\nOpportunities and recommendations\n\n- •\nEthical considerations discussed\n\n- •\nRelevance to African health systems\n\n\nThe extracted data were organized using a structured matrix to facilitate systematic comparison and analysis across studies. Key themes and patterns were identified through iterative review of the extracted data.\n\nA qualitative thematic synthesis approach was employed, involving the following analytical steps:\n\n- 1.\nFamiliarization with the data through repeated reading of extracted information\n\n- 2.\nInitial coding of data to identify key concepts and themes\n\n- 3.\nDevelopment of a thematic framework organizing codes into overarching themes\n\n- 4.\nMapping of themes to the research objectives\n\n- 5.\nInterpretation and synthesis of findings within and across themes\n\n- 6.\nCritical assessment of gaps and contradictions in the literature\n\n\nA qualitative synthesis was then performed to collate and analyze the findings, with particular emphasis on understanding how AI can be effectively integrated into public health strategies for managing Mpox in Africa. The analysis also included comprehensive examination of the ethical considerations and potential barriers to AI adoption in resource-limited settings. Special attention was paid to identifying context-specific factors that could influence AI implementation success in African health systems.\n\nThe synthesis process involved triangulation of findings across different study types and contexts to enhance the robustness of conclusions. Narrative synthesis techniques were employed to integrate quantitative and qualitative findings, with careful attention to the strength and consistency of evidence across different domains of AI application in Mpox management.\n\n## 3\\. The current state of Mpox in Africa\n\nIn July 2024, Mpox outbreaks were reported in several Central, East, and West African countries, marking the first-ever confirmed cases in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Burundi identified 142 cases from multiple districts, with children under five being the most affected. Kenya confirmed its first case, linked to travel from Uganda, while Rwanda reported four cases, with the majority involving recent travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Uganda's first two cases were detected in border areas. In West Africa, Côte d’Ivoire confirmed seven cases in three health districts, with no epidemiological links between the initial cases ( [World Health Organization, 2024c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib115)). On August 14 2024, following the recent outbreaks, the WHO Director-General declared that the surge in Mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the increasing spread across various African nations constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the most severe alert level under the International Health Regulations (2005).\n\nThe outbreak has been characterised by a higher-than-usual transmission rate, prompting urgent calls for enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, and public health interventions. The WHO has emphasised the need for vaccination campaigns targeting high-risk populations and healthcare workers to mitigate the outbreak’s impact ( [World Health Organization, 2024c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib115)). In response to the emergency, international health organisations and national governments are collaborating to allocate resources and implement effective strategies. Public awareness campaigns are being launched to educate communities about the symptoms, transmission, and prevention of Mpox. The situation remains dynamic, with health officials urging vigilance and prompt reporting of suspected cases to contain the outbreak and protect public health across the continent ( [World Health Organization, 2024c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib115)). Of note, the WHO recently recommended the integration of AI technologies into public health strategies to enhance outbreak response efforts. Key recommendations include enhanced surveillance, predictive modelling, diagnostic support, public awareness and education, as well as resource allocation. These recommendations underline the importance of leveraging AI to curb the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases such as Mpox in Africa ( [World Health Organization, 2024d](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib116)).\n\n### 3.1. Epidemiology and transmission\n\nMpox, caused by the Mpox virus (MPXV), is an infectious disease with two recognized clades: Clade I (previously Congo Basin clade) and Clade II (previously West African clade). Clade I is further divided into subclades Ia and the recently identified Ib, which emerged in South Kivu, DRC, and spreads mainly through sexual contact ( [World Health Organization, 2024c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib115)). MPXV transmission occurs via close contact with infected lesions, body fluids, respiratory particles, or contaminated materials, and through contact with animals or bushmeat. Symptoms typically appear within a week, lasting two to four weeks, and include fever, muscle aches, sore throat, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, with severe cases posing higher risks for children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals ( [Anil et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib10)). The epidemiology of the disease in endemic regions is complex and influenced by ecological, environmental, and socio-economic factors ( [Ogunleye et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib69)).\n\nThe mortality rate of Mpox varies depending on the clade of the virus and the healthcare resources available. The Central African (Congo Basin) clade is associated with a higher mortality rate, ranging from 1 % to 10 %, compared to the West African clade, which has a lower mortality rate ( [Bosworth et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib22)). The variation in mortality also reflects differences in healthcare access and the presence of co-morbidities. In regions with limited healthcare infrastructure, mortality rates are higher due to delayed diagnosis, lack of appropriate medical care, and the presence of other endemic diseases that can complicate the clinical course of Mpox. [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#tbl0010) shows the recent trends of Mpox in Africa as documented by WHO epidemiological data.\n\nTable 2. Trends of Mpox in Africa between 2022 and 18 August 2024.\n\n| **Country** | **Total cases** | **Total deaths** | **Cases in 2024** | **Deaths in 2024** | **Clades detected** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DRC | 4480 | 21 | 3235 | 19 | Ia and Ib |\n| Nigeria | 901 | 9 | 40 | 0 | II |\n| Burundi | 153 | 0 | 153 | 0 | Ib |\n| Ghana | 127 | 4 | 0 | 0 | II |\n| CAR | 92 | 2 | 45 | 1 | Ia |\n| Cameroon | 50 | 5 | 5 | 2 | Ia and II |\n| Congo | 45 | 2 | 19 | 0 | Ia |\n| South Africa | 29 | 3 | 24 | 3 | II |\n| Cote d’Ivoire | 28 | 1 | 28 | 1 | II |\n| Liberia | 23 | 0 | 5 | 0 | II |\n| Rwanda | 4 | 0 | 4 | 0 | Ib |\n| Benin | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | II |\n| Uganda | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | Ib |\n| Kenya | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Ib |\n| Mozambique | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | II |\n\n### 3.2. Challenges in managing Mpox\n\nManaging Mpox in Africa presents several significant challenges, many of which are rooted in the continent's socio-economic and healthcare landscape ( [Shehryar et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib87)). One of the most pressing issues is the limited diagnostic capacity in many endemic regions. Laboratory confirmation of Mpox is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective outbreak management ( [Silva et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib89)). However, in many parts of Africa, access to diagnostic facilities is limited. Most countries lack the necessary infrastructure, and where laboratories do exist, they are often concentrated in urban areas, far from the rural communities where outbreaks typically occur. This results in delayed diagnosis and underreporting of cases, hampering timely public health responses. In addition to diagnostic challenges, the surveillance systems in many African countries are insufficient to effectively monitor and respond to Mpox outbreaks ( [Giovanetti et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib39)). The absence of robust surveillance networks means that many cases go unreported, and outbreaks can spread unchecked before they are detected. Surveillance is further complicated by the remoteness of many affected areas, where health services are sparse, and healthcare workers are often overburdened and under-resourced. In some regions, the true burden of Mpox is likely underestimated due to the lack of comprehensive data ( [Bragazzi et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib23)).\n\nVaccine shortages present another significant hurdle in managing Mpox. Although the smallpox vaccine, which offers some protection against Mpox, is available, its supply is limited, and distribution is uneven across the continent. The logistical challenges of delivering vaccines to remote and underserved areas are substantial, exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and the high cost of maintaining cold chains necessary for vaccine storage and transport ( [Tovani-Palone, Doshi, and Pedersini, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib100)). Moreover, there is often a lack of public awareness and education about the benefits of vaccination, which, combined with mistrust in healthcare authorities, can lead to low vaccine uptake even where vaccines are available ( [Du et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib34)).\n\nPublic health responses to Mpox outbreaks are frequently hampered by logistical difficulties. Many of the regions where Mpox is endemic are characterized by rugged terrain, poor transportation networks, and isolated communities, making it challenging to deliver medical supplies and provide timely healthcare services ( [Tovani-Palone, Doshi, and Pedersini, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib100)). The logistical challenges are compounded by political instability and conflict in some areas, which can disrupt healthcare delivery and make it difficult for health workers to access affected populations. Mistrust of healthcare authorities and public health interventions is another significant barrier to managing Mpox in Africa ( [Biesty et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib21)). This mistrust is often rooted in historical and socio-cultural contexts, where previous public health interventions have been viewed with suspicion or have failed to address the needs and concerns of local populations. In some cases, misinformation and rumors about the disease and its treatment can spread rapidly, leading to resistance against vaccination campaigns and other public health measures. Building trust between healthcare providers and communities is essential for the success of any public health initiative, but this requires sustained effort and culturally sensitive approaches ( [Lansing et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib54)).\n\n## 4\\. AI in disease surveillance\n\nAI has the potential to revolutionize disease surveillance by enhancing the speed, accuracy, and effectiveness of detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks ( [World Health Organization, 2024d](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib116)). In the context of Mpox, a disease that has seen periodic outbreaks in Africa, AI offers tools that can significantly improve early detection and response efforts. By leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, AI can analyze complex patterns that are often beyond the capacity of traditional surveillance methods. This capability is particularly crucial in resource-limited settings where timely and accurate detection of outbreaks can make the difference between containment and widespread transmission. AI's application in disease surveillance includes early detection and monitoring of outbreaks through data analysis and predictive modeling to forecast the spread of the disease ( [Munir et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib62)). These capabilities can inform public health strategies, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately help in controlling and preventing the spread of Mpox. For example, in response to a Mpox outbreak in November 2017, Nigeria implemented the mobile-based Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) across 30 districts. SORMAS is a digital system for comprehensive disease surveillance. The system was adapted and launched within two weeks, leading to faster reporting, more complete data, and enhanced response capabilities ( [Silenou et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib88): [CDC, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib26)).\n\nThis approach is aligned with broader regional initiatives. For instance, the Africa CDC’s Strategic Plan for Digital Transformation (2023–2027) emphasizes the use of AI and big data in strengthening real-time outbreak surveillance and response systems across member states ( [Africa, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib3)). Similarly, the WHO Africa Region’s 2023 digital health report outlines successful pilot programs using mobile-based AI tools to monitor disease symptoms and trends in Uganda, Nigeria, and Ghana ( [WHO Regional Office for Africa, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib111)). These efforts demonstrate growing institutional commitment to integrating AI technologies into national and regional surveillance strategies. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#tbl0015) below documents the relevance of these AI systems in enhancing Mpox surveillance and response in Africa.\n\nTable 3. Comparative analysis of traditional Mpox methods to AI-based modalities.\n\n| **Feature** | **Traditional methods (Laboratory and clinician reporting)** | **Rule-based AI systems** | **Machine

2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib1)) |\n\nHowever, the scalability of AI in Africa faces significant constraints, including limited infrastructure, server capacity, energy system and connectivity required to meet demands for Mpox surveillance ( [Ade-Ibijola and Okonkwo, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib2), [Alaran et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib5), [Mienye et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib61)). Foremost, server capacity is a mainstay in the deployment of AI systems as it requires hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) to manage computational workloads efficiently ( [Alaran et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib5)). However, Africa faces challenges in establishing robust data centre due to inconsistent power grids, limited fiber optic connectivity, and underdeveloped cloud ecosystems ( [Ade **-** Ibijola and Okonkwo, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib2)). Cloud platforms can offer scalable solutions to this challenge, but its effectiveness depends on reliable local networking infrastructure, which are sparse in the affected central and West African countries ( [Haefner et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib42), [Mienye et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib61)). Achieving high scalability also demands low-latency, high-bandwidth networks which is another significant issue due to the uneven internet penetration and bandwidth limitations on the continent ( [Alaran et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib5)).\n\nTraining and deploying AI models require massive electricity. In Africa, where energy access is currently limited, efforts to scale AI models pose a dangerous risk of depriving other demands for electricity ( [Pasipamire and Muroyiwa, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib80)). AI inference consumes 80–90 % of total energy with data centre exceeding regulatory benchmarks required to comply with efficiency measures which are currently poorly defined in the African continent ( [Alaran et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib5)). Hence, a reliance on diesel generators in regions with unstable grids increases operational cost and carbon footprints, limiting the sustainability of AI growth on the continent ( [Mienye, Sun and Ileberi, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib61)).\n\nThe economic and political commitment to AI deployment is important in scalability of AI models ( [Ade-Ibijola and Okonkwo, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib2), [Alaran et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib5)). Cloud solutions can reduce upfront costs but recurring expenses for storage and compute power can make up a significant part of the economic commitment. Security and maintenance such as server upgrades also require scarce skilled labor. Hence, to achieve scalable AI in Africa, investments must prioritize grid modernization, renewable energy integration, and access to cross-border cloud infrastructure ( [Pasipamire and Muroyiwa, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib80)).\n\n### 4.1. Early detection and monitoring\n\nAI plays a critical role in the early detection and monitoring of Mpox outbreaks, which is essential for initiating timely public health interventions. Traditional surveillance methods, often reliant on manual reporting and data collection, can be slow and prone to inaccuracies, especially in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. In contrast, AI-driven tools can process vast amounts of data from diverse sources in real-time, providing early warnings of potential outbreaks ( [Anjaria et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib11)). Machine learning algorithms, a subset of AI, can analyze data from various sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), social media, news reports, and even environmental sensors, to identify early signs of an outbreak ( [Setegn & Dejene, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib86); A. [Thakur, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib97), [Thakur et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib98)). For example, EHRs can be analyzed to detect unusual patterns of symptoms that may indicate the emergence of Mpox cases. Similarly, AI can be used to sift through large volumes of social media posts to detect discussions related to symptoms or the occurrence of disease in specific regions ( [Zhao et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib123)). Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to understand and interpret human language, is particularly useful in this context, as it can automatically process and interpret text data, identifying keywords and phrases that may signal an emerging outbreak ( [Al-Garadi, Yang, and Sarker, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib6)). For instance, an increase in social media posts mentioning symptoms like fever, rash, or lymphadenopathy, particularly in endemic regions, could prompt further investigation by public health authorities. Moreover, AI systems can integrate data from news reports, which often cover disease outbreaks before official reports are published. By cross-referencing information from multiple sources, AI can provide a comprehensive overview of the situation, identifying potential hotspots and enabling a quicker response ( [Anjaria et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib11)). This ability to analyze and synthesize data from various platforms in real-time can significantly enhance the monitoring of Mpox, particularly in regions where traditional surveillance systems are weak or non-existent.\n\nIn addition to AI-enabled data analysis and outbreak detection, emerging biosensing technologies offer complementary diagnostic capabilities that can greatly enhance Mpox surveillance, particularly in field settings where laboratory access is limited. Advanced platforms such as CRISPR/Cas12a-powered surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors have demonstrated ultra-sensitive and highly specific detection capabilities for viral pathogens, as seen in recent diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 variants ( [Wang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib107)). These platforms can deliver real-time, label-free detection with high sensitivity, down to femtomolar concentrations, providing valuable point-of-care diagnostic solutions. Similarly, antimonene-based SPR sensors and polarization-sensitive photodetectors built on two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have shown promise in the ultrasensitive detection of microRNAs and viral nucleic acids ( [Zhou et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib125), [Liu et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib57)). These technologies offer faster turnaround times and lower detection limits compared to traditional RT-PCR or ELISA-based diagnostics. For instance, biosensors capable of detecting biomarkers with femtomolar-level sensitivity ( [Zhang et al., 2022b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib122)) could be instrumental in diagnosing Mpox during the early symptomatic phase or in subclinical cases.\n\n### 4.2. Predictive modeling\n\nBeyond early detection, AI-driven predictive models are powerful tools for forecasting the spread of Mpox ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)). Predictive modeling uses historical data to identify patterns and trends in disease transmission, allowing public health authorities to anticipate where and how future outbreaks might occur. These models can incorporate a wide range of variables, including population density, animal reservoir distribution, climate conditions, and human mobility patterns, to generate detailed predictions about the potential spread of the virus ( [Zhao et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib123)). One of the key strengths of AI in predictive modeling is its ability to handle complex and non-linear relationships between variables ( [Liang et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib56)). For instance, AI models can analyze how changes in climate conditions, such as temperature and humidity, might affect the habitats of animal reservoirs and consequently influence the likelihood of zoonotic transmission. Similarly, AI can incorporate human mobility data to predict how the movement of people between regions might facilitate the spread of the virus ( [Zhao et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib123)). This is particularly relevant in the African context, where cross-border movements and migration patterns can significantly impact the spread of infectious diseases like Mpox.\n\nBy predicting where outbreaks are likely to occur next, AI-driven models can guide public health interventions more effectively ( [Munir et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib62)). For example, if a model predicts a high likelihood of an outbreak in a specific region, public health authorities can preemptively deploy resources such as vaccines, medical supplies, and healthcare personnel to that area. This proactive approach can help contain outbreaks before they escalate, reducing both the spread of the virus and the burden on healthcare systems. Additionally, predictive models can assist in optimizing resource allocation during an outbreak ( [Wang et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib108)). By identifying areas at highest risk, these models can help ensure that limited resources are directed where they are most needed, improving the efficiency of the public health response. This is especially important in resource-constrained settings, where the strategic use of available resources can have a significant impact on the outcome of an outbreak.\n\n## 5\\. AI in contact tracing and case management\n\nAI has the potential to significantly improve contact tracing and case management for Mpox, which are critical components in controlling the spread of the virus and ensuring effective treatment ( [Uzun Ozsahin et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib104)). Traditional methods of contact tracing and case management are often resource-intensive and time-consuming, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. AI can streamline these processes by leveraging advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques, leading to more efficient and accurate identification of potential cases and optimization of treatment strategies ( [Alowais et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib8)). This section explores the role of AI in automating contact tracing and enhancing case management, ultimately contributing to more effective public health interventions.\n\n### 5.1. Automated contact tracing\n\nContact tracing is a cornerstone of infectious disease control, crucial for identifying individuals who have been exposed to a virus and preventing further transmission ( [Uzun Ozsahin et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib104)). However, traditional contact tracing methods rely heavily on manual processes, including interviews with patients to identify their recent contacts and the subsequent follow-up with those contacts. This approach can be slow, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, especially during large-scale outbreaks where the number of cases can overwhelm public health resources. AI offers a transformative solution to these challenges by automating contact tracing through the use of mobile phone data and location-tracking algorithms ( [Chowdhury et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib30)). Mobile phones, which are widely used even in many remote regions of Africa, generate a wealth of location data that can be harnessed to trace the movements of individuals and identify potential contacts. AI algorithms can analyze this data to determine where and when individuals may have come into close contact with an infected person, often with greater speed and accuracy than manual methods ( [El-Bouzaidi and Abdoun, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib36)).\n\nFor example, when a confirmed case of Mpox is identified, AI systems can rapidly analyze the individual's mobile phone data to reconstruct their movements and identify other mobile phones that were in proximity during the likely period of infectiousness. These algorithms can consider various factors, such as the duration and frequency of contact, to prioritize contacts who are at higher risk of having contracted the virus ( [Chowdhury et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib30)). This automated process significantly reduces the time required to identify and notify contacts, enabling quicker implementation of quarantine measures and reducing the potential for further transmission ( [El-Bouzaidi and Abdoun, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib36)). In addition to improving the speed and efficiency of contact tracing, AI-driven approaches also enhance privacy protection. By using advanced encryption and anonymization techniques, AI systems can ensure that individuals' data is protected, addressing concerns about privacy and data security that are often associated with digital contact tracing ( [Zhou **,** Huang, and Gao, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib124)). This is particularly important in building public trust and encouraging widespread adoption of contact tracing technologies, which is essential for their effectiveness.\n\n### 5.2. AI-enhanced case management\n\nEffective case management is crucial for improving outcomes in Mpox patients, particularly given the potential for severe complications in certain populations ( [Anil et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib10)). AI can play a pivotal role in enhancing case management by providing healthcare providers with tools to predict disease progression and optimize treatment plans. Machine learning models, which are a key component of AI, can analyze large datasets of patient information to identify patterns and correlations that may not be immediately apparent through traditional analysis ( [Alowais et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib8)). These models can be trained on data from past Mpox cases, including clinical symptoms, laboratory results, demographic information, and treatment outcomes, to develop predictive algorithms that assess the risk of severe disease. For example, AI models can identify specific combinations of symptoms or biomarkers that are associated with a higher likelihood of complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis, enabling healthcare providers to prioritize high-risk patients for more intensive monitoring and care ( [Stokes et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib96)).\n\nIn addition to risk stratification, AI can assist in optimizing treatment plans by integrating evidence-based guidelines with real-time patient data. AI-powered decision support systems can provide clinicians with tailored recommendations for treatment based on the latest research and the individual characteristics of each patient ( [Elhaddad and Hamam, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib37)). For instance, these systems can suggest the most appropriate antiviral therapies, dosage adjustments, or supportive care measures based on the patient’s age, underlying health conditions, and the severity of the disease. This personalized approach to treatment can improve patient outcomes by ensuring that care is both timely and appropriate for the specific needs of each patient. Moreover, AI can facilitate better resource management within healthcare settings by predicting the course of the outbreak and the demand for medical resources. By analyzing trends in case numbers and disease severity, AI systems can forecast the need for hospital beds, intensive care units, and medical supplies, helping healthcare facilities prepare for and respond to surges in demand (Wu et al., 2023). This proactive approach is particularly valuable in resource-limited settings, where the availability of medical resources may be constrained.\n\n## 6\\. AI in public health communication\n\nEffective public health communication is a vital component in managing infectious disease outbreaks, such as Mpox ( [Biesty et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib21)). The success of public health initiatives often hinges on the ability to convey accurate, timely, and culturally appropriate information to diverse populations. In the context of Mpox, where misinformation can spread rapidly and hinder public health efforts, AI offers powerful tools to enhance communication strategies. AI can help tailor public health messages to different audiences, ensuring that they are both effective and culturally relevant. Additionally, AI plays a crucial role in identifying and counteracting misinformation, which is essential for maintaining public trust and encouraging adherence to health guidelines ( [Edinger et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib35)). This section discusses how AI can be leveraged in public health communication, focusing on personalized communication strategies and combating misinformation.\n\n### 6.1. Personalized communication strategies\n\nPublic health communication must be carefully crafted to resonate with different segments of the population, taking into account factors such as cultural norms, language, literacy levels, and access to information. One-size-fits-all messages are often less effective, particularly in the diverse socio-cultural landscapes of African countries where Mpox is endemic. AI can significantly enhance the personalization of public health communication by analyzing demographic data and tailoring messages to the specific needs and preferences of different communities ( [Jungwirth and Haluza, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib49)). AI algorithms can process vast amounts of demographic data, including age, gender, education level, income, language, and geographical location, to identify the most effective communication channels and content for each target audience ( [Haleem et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib43)). For example, in a rural community with limited internet access, AI might suggest using radio broadcasts or community meetings as the primary means of disseminating information. In contrast, in urban areas with higher internet penetration, social media platforms might be more effective.\n\nMoreover, AI can analyze social media activity, survey responses, and other data sources to assess how different communities respond to various types of messages. By examining factors such as the language, tone, and emotional appeal of successful messages, AI can help public health authorities craft communications that are more likely to be understood, accepted, and acted upon ( [Nkabane-Nkholongo et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib66)). For instance, in a community that places a high value on familial ties and collective well-being, messages that emphasize protecting family members from Mpox might resonate more strongly than those that focus on individual health. Additionally, AI can be used to translate and adapt health messages into multiple languages and dialects, ensuring that non-dominant language speakers are not excluded from critical information ( [Barwise et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib18)). This capability is particularly important in multilingual regions where a significant portion of the population may not speak the national language fluently.\n\nSeveral African case studies demonstrate the value of culturally adapted AI chatbots in public health communication. In Lesotho, the “Nthabi” conversational agent, adapted from a U.S.-based model, was modified with local language (Sesotho idioms), culturally relevant non-verbal behaviors, and input from community leaders and youth women. Users reported the chatbot as trustworthy, relatable, and useful for reproductive health education ( [Nkabane-Nkholongo et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib66)). In Senegal, the Saytù Hemophilie AI chatbot developed for people with haemophilia, available in French and Wolof, was co-designed with patients and clinicians. It scored highly on usability and cultural relevance and significantly improved health knowledge among users in Wolof-speaking communities ( [Babington-Ashaye et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib15)). By ensuring that health messages are accessible and culturally appropriate, AI can increase the likelihood that these messages will be heeded, ultimately contributing to more effective disease prevention and control.\n\n### 6.2. Combating misinformation\n\nMisinformation poses a significant threat to public health, particularly during infectious disease outbreaks when uncertainty and fear can lead to the rapid spread of false information. In the case of Mpox, misinformation can take many forms, from incorrect beliefs about the causes and symptoms of the disease to dangerous myths about prevention and treatment. Such misinformation can undermine public health efforts by leading people to ignore official guidance, delay seeking medical care, or engage in harmful behaviors ( [Edinger et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib35)). AI offers powerful tools to combat misinformation by detecting false or misleading information as it emerges and enabling a rapid response. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, AI can monitor social media platforms, news websites, blogs, and other online sources in real-time to identify content that contains misinformation ( [Santos, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib85)). For example, AI algorithms can be trained to recognize specific keywords, phrases, and patterns commonly associated with false claims about Mpox. Once detected, this content can be flagged for review by public health authorities or automatically countered with accurate information.\n\nAI can also analyze the spread of misinformation to understand how it propagates through different networks and communities. By mapping out the pathways through which false information spreads, AI can help public health officials target their counter-messaging efforts more effectively ( [Edinger et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib35)). For instance, if misinformation is found to be spreading rapidly within a particular social media group or community, targeted interventions can be deployed to that group, such as posting corrected information, engaging trusted community leaders to refute the false claims, or adjusting public health messaging to address specific misconceptions.\n\nOn-ground implementations in African countries highlight the role of AI chatbots in countering misinformation. For instance, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and UNICEF launched an SMS and WhatsApp chatbot in Nigeria during COVID-19, providing vetted information in local formats and reducing misinformation spread through community outreach ( [NCDC, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib65)). Chatbots embedded in platforms such as RapidPro reached millions, often in multiple African languages, helping public health communications remain accurate and culturally resonant ( [UNICEF, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib103)). Furthermore, AI can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different counter-messaging strategies. By analyzing engagement metrics, such as shares, likes, and comments, AI can determine which types of corrective information are most effective at reducing the spread of misinformation. This continuous feedback loop allows public health authorities to refine their communication strategies in real-time, improving their ability to counteract misinformation and maintain public trust ( [Edinger et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib35)).\n\n## 7\\. AI in resource allocation and logistics\n\nEfficient resource allocation and logistics are critical in managing outbreaks of infectious diseases like Mpox, particularly in resource-limited settings where supplies such as vaccines, antiviral drugs, and personal protective equipment (PPE) are often scarce ( [Persad et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib83)). A offers powerful tools to optimize these processes, ensuring that resources are distributed efficiently and that supply chains operate smoothly (Wu et al., 2023). By leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics, AI can analyze complex data sets to determine the most effective strategies for resource distribution and supply chain management. This section explores how AI can be applied to optimize resource allocation and improve supply chain management, ultimately enhancing the response to Mpox outbreaks.\n\n### 7.1. Optimizing resource distribution\n\nIn the face of an outbreak, the timely and equitable distribution of resources such as vaccines, antiviral drugs, and PPE is essential to controlling the spread of the disease and protecting vulnerable populations ( [Persad et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib83)). However, in many parts of Africa, where Mpox is endemic, the challenge of distributing limited resources is exacerbated by factors such as inadequate healthcare infrastructure, vast geographical distances, and logistical constraints ( [Manirambona et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib58)). AI can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges by optimizing resource distribution through advanced data analysis and decision-making algorithms.\n\nMachine learning algorithms can analyze a wide range of factors to determine the most efficient allocation of resources. These factors include disease prevalence, population density, healthcare infrastructure, transportation networks, and socio-economic conditions smoothly (Wu, et al., 2023). For example, AI models can process data on the current spread of Mpox to identify hotspots where the demand for vaccines or antiviral drugs is likely to be highest. By integrating this information with data on healthcare facility capacities and transportation routes, AI can recommend the most efficient distribution strategies, ensuring that resources are directed to areas where they will have the greatest impact.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help balance the distribution of resources between urban and rural areas, addressing the often-significant disparities in healthcare access ( [d'Elia et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib32)). In many regions, rural communities are at a higher risk of being underserved due to their remote locations and the logistical challenges involved in reaching them. AI-driven resource allocation models can prioritize these areas, taking into account factors such as the time required to deliver supplies, the availability of healthcare personnel, and the local population's vulnerability to the disease ( [Wahl et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib105)). By doing so, AI can help ensure that even the most remote and underserved communities receive the resources they need to combat Mpox effectively.\n\nIn addition to optimizing the distribution of physical resources, AI can also assist in allocating human resources, such as healthcare workers, to areas where they are most needed ( [Li et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib55)). During an outbreak, the demand for healthcare personnel can quickly outstrip supply, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. AI can analyze data on the availability of healthcare workers, the severity of the outbreak, and the local healthcare system's capacity to determine the optimal deployment of personnel. This ensures that critical areas receive the support they need, reducing the strain on local healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes.\n\n### 7.2. Improving supply chain management\n\nEffective supply chain management is essential for ensuring that medical supplies, including vaccines, antiviral drugs, and PPE, are available when and where they are needed during an outbreak. However, managing supply chains in the context of an infectious disease outbreak is fraught with challenges, including fluctuating demand, transportation delays, and potential bottlenecks in production or distribution ( [Raj et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib84)). AI-driven analytics can enhance supply chain management by predicting demand, identifying potential bottlenecks, and optimizing procurement strategies, thereby ensuring that healthcare providers have the necessary tools to manage Mpox cases effectively ( [Belhadi et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib20)).\n\nOne of the key advantages of AI in supply chain management is its ability to forecast demand accurately. By analyzing data on disease trends, healthcare utilization, and previous outbreaks, AI models can predict the likely demand for medical supplies over time ( [Khosravi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib51)). This allows public health authorities and healthcare providers to plan ahead, ensuring that they have sufficient stockpiles of essential supplies to meet anticipated needs. For instance, if AI models predict a surge in Mpox cases in a particular region, they can trigger orders for additional vaccines and PPE well in advance, preventing shortages that could otherwise hinder the response to the outbreak.\n\nAI can also identify potential bottlenecks in the supply chain, such as delays in production, transportation, or distribution. By monitoring real-time data on supply chain operations, AI systems can detect early signs of disruptions and recommend corrective actions ( [Walter, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib106)). For example, if a delay in the delivery of vaccines is detected, AI can suggest alternative transportation routes or suppliers to ensure that the vaccines reach their destination on time. This proactive approach helps to minimize the risk of supply chain disruptions, ensuring that critical supplies are available when needed.\n\nMoreover, AI can optimize procurement strategies by analyzing factors such as cost, supplier reliability, and delivery times. During an outbreak, it is essential to balance the need for timely procurement with the constraints of budget and availability ( [Spieske et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib95)). AI-driven procurement systems can evaluate different suppliers and delivery options to identify the most cost-effective and reliable sources for medical supplies ( [Khosravi et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib51)). This not only helps to reduce costs but also ensures that healthcare providers receive high-quality supplies in a timely manner. In addition to optimizing the procurement and distribution of supplies, AI can also enhance inventory management within healthcare facilities. By monitoring usage patterns and predicting future needs, AI systems can help healthcare providers maintain optimal inventory levels, reducing the risk of both shortages and overstocking ( [Olayinka et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib74)). This ensures that supplies are available when needed, while also minimizing waste and reducing costs. [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#tbl0020) below contains various AI technologies, their application and the expected outcomes in Mpox management in Africa. The public health stakeholders which are expected occupy prominent positions in the delivery of AI technologies are also included.\n\nTable 4.

Challenges of using AI to manage and curb Mpox in Africa\n\nWhile the application of AI holds significant promise in managing and reducing the spread of Mpox in Africa, there are several challenges that must be addressed to fully realize its potential. These challenges span across technical, infrastructural, ethical, and socio-economic dimensions, and they highlight the complexities involved in deploying AI technologies effectively in diverse and resource-limited settings.\n\n### 8.1. Limited digital infrastructure\n\nOne of the foremost challenges in implementing AI solutions in Africa is the limited digital infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas where Mpox is often endemic ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)). Reliable internet connectivity, access to digital devices, and adequate power supply are essential for the functioning of AI-driven tools, yet these are not consistently available across the continent ( [Herath and Mittal, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib47)). In many regions, the lack of robust digital infrastructure can severely hamper the deployment of AI technologies, from data collection and processing to the real-time application of AI models in the field. Moreover, the digital divide between urban and rural areas further exacerbates inequalities in healthcare delivery ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)). While AI systems may be implemented more easily in urban centers with better infrastructure, rural communities, often the most vulnerable to outbreaks, may be left behind. Addressing these infrastructural gaps is critical to ensuring that AI-driven health interventions are inclusive and effective across all regions.\n\n### 8.2. Data availability and quality\n\nAI systems rely heavily on large datasets to train machine learning models, make predictions, and optimize resource allocation. However, in many parts of Africa, there is a lack of comprehensive, high-quality health data ( [Esan et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib38)). Challenges such as underreporting of cases, inconsistent record-keeping, and limited access to electronic health records (EHRs) can significantly hinder the effectiveness of AI models ( [Tsai et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib101)). The scarcity of accurate and up-to-date epidemiological data on Mpox, coupled with the variability in data quality across different regions, poses a major obstacle to the development and deployment of AI solutions ( [Zhang et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib121)). Furthermore, there is often a lack of standardization in how health data is collected and reported across different countries and regions ( [Gong et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib40)). This can make it difficult to aggregate and analyze data at a scale necessary for effective AI application. Without reliable data, AI models may produce inaccurate or biased results, potentially leading to suboptimal decision-making and resource allocation.\n\n### 8.3. Ethical and privacy concerns\n\nThe use of AI in public health raises significant ethical and privacy concerns, particularly when it involves the collection and analysis of sensitive personal health data ( [Olawade et al., 2025a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib73)). In Africa, where there may be varying levels of awareness and regulation around data privacy, the implementation of AI-driven health initiatives could face resistance from communities concerned about how their data is used and protected. Issues such as data ownership, consent, and the potential for misuse of personal information must be carefully managed to build trust and ensure ethical compliance ( [Nienaber McKay et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib64)). Moreover, there are significant concerns regarding algorithmic bias and the potential exacerbation of existing health disparities. If AI models are trained on datasets that underrepresent diverse populations affected by Mpox, they may produce biased results that favor urban, higher-income, or lighter-skinned individuals, undermining equity in detection and treatment ( [Singhal et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib90); [Dankwa-Mullan, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib31)). For example, predictive models derived from clinical data in the Global North may perform poorly in African settings, particularly for tropical diseases and populations with different genetics and physiology ( [Grancia, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib41)). Also, intersectional ethical concerns arise when AI disadvantages individuals who occupy multiple marginalised identities such as rural, low-literacy women or people living in informal settlements. These groups may have less internet access, fewer recorded health interactions, and thus generate less AI training data, leading to their systematic underrepresentation in healthcare models ( [Bauer and Lizotte, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib19)). Ensuring that AI technologies are developed and applied in ways that are fair, transparent, and equitable is crucial to their success in public health contexts ( [Singhal et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib90)).\n\n### 8.4. Technical expertise and capacity building\n\nThe successful deployment of AI technologies in managing Mpox outbreaks requires a skilled workforce capable of developing, implementing, and maintaining these systems. However, there is a significant shortage of technical expertise in AI and data science across much of Africa ( [Ade **-** Ibijola and Okonkwo, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib2)). This gap in human resources can limit the ability of health systems to effectively integrate AI tools into their operations, from disease surveillance to contact tracing and resource allocation. Capacity building is, therefore, a critical challenge. Governments, academic institutions, and international organizations must invest in education and training programs to develop the necessary expertise in AI and public health ( [Southworth et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib94)). This includes not only training data scientists and AI specialists but also equipping healthcare workers with the skills to use AI tools effectively in their daily work. Without adequate investment in capacity building, the potential benefits of AI in managing Mpox may not be fully realized.\n\n### 8.5. Financial and logistical constraints\n\nImplementing AI solutions in the management of Mpox outbreaks also involves significant financial and logistical challenges. Developing, deploying, and maintaining AI systems can be costly, particularly in regions where healthcare budgets are already stretched thin. The initial investment required for AI infrastructure, software, and training can be prohibitive for many countries in Africa, limiting their ability to adopt these technologies on a wide scale ( [Arakpogun et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib13)). However, to address these challenges, several funding mechanisms and support initiatives have emerged to strengthen the digital health ecosystem across Africa.\n\nNotably, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has launched the AI4Health program, as part of its broader Digital Transformation Strategy. This initiative provides financial support, technical assistance, and innovation grants to help scale AI solutions in healthcare. The program also supports public-health informatics fellowships and innovation sandboxes that serve as collaborative environments for developing context-specific AI tools ( [Africa, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib3)). Similarly, the HealthTech Hub Africa’s AI for Health Innovation Challenge, backed by the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, offers financial grants up to $150,000 as well as capacity-building and mentorship to early-stage health-tech startups that are leveraging AI to solve pressing health challenges across the continent ( [HealthTech Hub, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib46)).\n\nDespite these promising developments, logistical hurdles persist. Health systems in many parts of Africa remain fragmented and under-resourced, complicating the integration of AI without disrupting essential services. Effective implementation requires coordination among national governments, public health agencies, healthcare providers, and international development partners. The Africa CDC’s fellowships and HealthTech Hub’s accelerator initiatives contribute not just funding, but also support for workforce development and system-wide integration - key components for ensuring that AI technologies are not only deployed but also embedded effectively within public health responses ( [Khorram-Manesh et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib50)).\n\n### 8.6. Resistance to technological adoption\n\nFinally, there may be resistance to the adoption of AI technologies within healthcare systems and communities. Healthcare providers may be skeptical of relying on AI-driven tools, particularly if they are seen as replacing rather than augmenting human decision-making ( [Yelne et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib118)). Similarly, communities that are unfamiliar with AI technologies may be wary of their use in managing disease outbreaks, especially if they do not understand how these systems work or how their data will be used. Building trust and demonstrating the value of AI in improving health outcomes are essential to overcoming this resistance ( [O'Dell et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib67)). Thus, to address skepticism among healthcare providers and communities, targeted training programs should be implemented to build confidence in using AI tools and clarify their role as decision-support systems rather than replacements for human expertise. Incorporating AI into hybrid workflows, where AI provides real-time insights while human professionals retain decision-making authority, can further ease concerns and promote adoption ( [Sokol et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib93)). Engaging trusted local health workers as champions and piloting AI interventions in familiar clinical settings can demonstrate practical value and foster trust. Transparent communication and community education campaigns can also help demystify AI, reinforcing its role as an enabler rather than a disruptor of care ( [Sokol et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib93)).\n\n### 8.7. Algorithmic fairness and bias mitigation framework\n\nTo ensure equitable AI implementation in Mpox management, a systematic methodological framework for auditing and ensuring algorithmic fairness is essential. This framework comprises four key phases: (1) Pre-deployment bias assessment involving comprehensive evaluation of training data representativeness across demographic groups, geographic regions, and socioeconomic strata, with particular attention to underrepresented populations in rural and remote areas; (2) Algorithm audit protocols implementing statistical parity, equalized odds, and calibration metrics to assess differential performance across subgroups, utilizing techniques such as adversarial debiasing and fairness-aware machine learning; (3) Continuous monitoring systems employing real-time bias detection algorithms that track performance disparities during deployment, with automated alerts when fairness thresholds are breached; and (4) Iterative correction mechanisms incorporating feedback loops for model retraining, stakeholder engagement processes for fairness criteria definition, and community-based validation of AI outputs.\n\nThe framework specifically addresses African contexts by incorporating intersectional analysis considering multiple identity dimensions (rural/urban, gender, ethnicity, literacy level, economic status), establishing culturally-appropriate fairness metrics developed in collaboration with local communities, and implementing participatory design processes that engage affected populations in defining equitable outcomes. Regular algorithmic audits should be conducted using standardized fairness assessment tools adapted for resource-limited settings, with results transparently reported to stakeholders and communities. This systematic approach ensures that AI systems for Mpox management actively promote rather than perpetuate existing health inequities.\n\n## 9\\. Future directions and recommendations\n\nWhile AI technologies bring powerful capabilities to Mpox management, it is essential to underscore that these tools are designed to support, not replace, human decision-making. In clinical and public health contexts, especially within low-resource African settings, the judgment of healthcare professionals remains central to interpreting AI outputs, adapting strategies to local realities, and ensuring ethical and culturally sensitive responses. AI functions best as a decision-support system, enhancing the speed and scope of analysis, but still depends on trained personnel to validate and act upon its recommendations ( [WHO, 2024e](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib110)). This collaboration between humans and AI is particularly important in complex or high-stakes scenarios, such as triage, outbreak response coordination, and patient management, where contextual judgment and ethical considerations are indispensable ( [Sokol et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib93)). Promoting human-AI synergy ensures that technological advances remain grounded in public health priorities and community trust.\n\nAs the application of AI in managing and reducing the spread of Mpox in Africa continues to evolve, it is crucial to consider the future directions and necessary steps to fully realize its potential. AI has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing various aspects of public health, from surveillance and contact tracing to resource allocation and communication. Also, targeted efforts must focus on precision enhancement through interdisciplinary collaboration and deployment of cost-effective technologies tailored to resource-limited settings. However, to maximize its impact on Mpox control, strategic efforts must be made to integrate AI into public health systems and advance research and development tailored to the specific challenges of managing this disease in Africa.\n\n### 9.1. Defining AI's role in Mpox response architecture\n\nThroughout this review, AI is explicitly positioned as an augmentative decision-support tool rather than an autonomous decision-maker in Mpox management systems. This human-AI collaborative approach recognizes that effective public health responses require the irreplaceable elements of human judgment, cultural sensitivity, ethical reasoning, and contextual understanding that AI systems cannot replicate. AI serves to enhance human capabilities by providing rapid data analysis, pattern recognition, predictive insights, and optimization recommendations, while human experts retain ultimate responsibility for decision-making, strategy formulation, and ethical oversight.\n\nIn the Mpox response architecture, AI functions as an intelligent assistant that amplifies human capacity across surveillance (processing vast datasets to identify outbreak signals), contact tracing (automating data collection while requiring human verification), case management (providing risk stratification to support clinical judgment), communication (generating culturally-appropriate content for human review and approval), and resource allocation (optimizing distribution plans for human implementation). This collaborative model is particularly crucial in African contexts where community trust, cultural understanding, and local knowledge systems are fundamental to successful public health interventions.\n\nThe augmentative approach ensures that AI implementation strengthens rather than undermines existing health system capacity, builds local expertise, and maintains community engagement essential for sustainable disease control. All AI recommendations require human validation, and systems must include override mechanisms enabling healthcare workers to modify or reject AI-generated suggestions based on local knowledge and professional judgment.\n\n### 9.2. Integration of AI into public health systems\n\nFor AI to be truly effective in managing Mpox, it must be seamlessly integrated into existing public health systems. This integration requires a multifaceted approach that includes investment in infrastructure, training, and collaboration among key stakeholders ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)). To support AI-driven initiatives, significant investments in digital infrastructure are needed, particularly in regions where such infrastructure is currently lacking. This includes improving internet connectivity, ensuring reliable power supply, and expanding access to digital devices in rural and underserved areas. By enhancing the digital backbone of healthcare systems, AI tools can be deployed more effectively, enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and response ( [Bajwa et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib16)).\n\nThe successful deployment of AI technologies depends on the ability of healthcare workers to use these tools effectively. Training programs should be developed to equip healthcare professionals with the necessary skills to operate AI systems, interpret AI-generated data, and integrate AI insights into clinical and public health decision-making ( [Olawade et al., 2025b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib71)). This training should be ongoing and adapted to the evolving capabilities of AI technologies. The integration of AI into public health systems requires close collaboration between governments, technology companies, and international organizations. Governments must play a leading role in creating policies and frameworks that support the ethical and equitable use of AI in healthcare ( [Mennella et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib60)). Technology companies should work closely with public health authorities to develop AI solutions that are tailored to the specific needs and challenges of managing Mpox in Africa.\n\nImportantly, AI integration must align with existing continental and national policy frameworks. The Africa CDC Digital Transformation Strategy (2023) outlines flagship initiatives such as digital surveillance systems, public health informatics fellowships, and scalable HealthTech platforms that directly support AI adoption for disease surveillance, contact tracing, and telehealth ( [Africa, 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib3)). Meanwhile, the Smart Africa Alliance’s establishment of the Africa Artificial Intelligence Council in April 2025 marks a coordinated effort to develop AI computing infrastructure, datasets, governance frameworks, and skills development across the continent ( [Smart Africa Alliance, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib91)). These policy linkages demonstrate that AI-driven Mpox interventions have an established framework into which they can be integrated, accelerating their adoption and scale.\n\nInternational organizations, such as the WHO, can facilitate knowledge sharing, provide technical assistance, and promote best practices in the use of AI for public health ( [World Health Organization, 2024b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib114)). By prioritizing these areas, AI can be more effectively integrated into public health systems, enhancing the capacity to manage and control Mpox outbreaks.\n\nFurthermore, public health systems should enhance AI algorithm precision through interdisciplinary collaboration by establishing multi-stakeholder development teams combining epidemiologists, data scientists, clinicians, and community representatives to co-develop culturally-appropriate AI algorithms. Implement systematic collection of African-specific training data reflecting local disease presentations, demographic patterns, and environmental factors through university-healthcare facility partnerships. Develop validation frameworks testing algorithms across diverse African contexts and establish real-time feedback systems for continuous algorithm improvement based on frontline healthcare worker observations.\n\n### 9.3. Research and development\n\nOngoing research and development (R&D) are critical to advancing the use of AI in the management of Mpox. To address the unique challenges posed by the disease in Africa, R&D efforts should focus on refining AI algorithms, developing new applications, and ensuring that AI-driven solutions are culturally and contextually appropriate ( [Chadaga et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib28)). Existing AI algorithms must be continuously refined to improve their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting, detecting, and managing Mpox outbreaks. This includes the development of more sophisticated predictive models that can account for the complex epidemiological and environmental factors influencing the spread of the virus in different regions. Additionally, efforts should be made to enhance the accuracy of AI-driven diagnostic tools, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to laboratory facilities may be restricted ( [Oduoye et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib68)).Beyond refining existing tools, there is a need for the development of new AI applications that address specific gaps in the current public health response to Mpox ( [Patel et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib81)). This could include AI systems designed to support the rapid development and distribution of vaccines, tools for real-time monitoring of vaccine efficacy, and AI-driven platforms that facilitate community engagement and participation in public health initiatives. The development of AI applications that can operate effectively in low-resource environments, where digital infrastructure and data availability may be limited, is also a priority ( [Osonuga et al., 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#bib76)).\n\nAdditionally, the deployment of low-cost AI technologies in resource-limited areas such as, offline-capable mobile applications functioning without internet connectivity on low-end smartphones, SMS-based AI surveillance systems utilizing basic mobile phones for case reporting and contact tracing, and solar-powered diagnostic devices for remote health facilities. Establish community-based digital health hubs with shared tablet computers and portable connectivity serving multiple villages to reduce per-capita costs while enabling access to AI-powered health tools.\n\nAI-driven public health communication must be tailored to the cultural and social contexts of the populations it aims to serve. Research should focus on developing AI tools that can analyze and adapt to the cultural nuances of different communities, ensuring that health messages are not only accurate but also resonate with the intended audience. This includes understanding language preferences, social norms, and trust dynamics within communities. By developing culturally sensitive communication strategies, AI can play a key role in improving public understanding of Mpox, reducing stigma, and promoting preventive behaviors. AI technologies continue to evolve, it is essential that ethical considerations remain at the forefront of R&D efforts. Research should explore ways to ensure that AI systems are used in ways that protect individual privacy, prevent bias, and promote equity. This includes the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks that can guide the responsible use of AI in public health. [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093425001636?via%3Dihub#tbl0025) below gives an overview of the current challenges facing AI implementation in the management and control of Mpox in Africa.

Develop graduated financing models transitioning from international donor support (Years 1–2) to government budgets (Years 3–5) to local revenue generation (Years 5 +). Create regional knowledge sharing platforms through Africa CDC frameworks and establish standardized performance monitoring with quarterly review processes for continuous improvement.\n\nThese specific strategies enable African countries to move beyond aspirational AI adoption toward practical, sustainable integration that meaningfully enhances Mpox management while building local capacity and ensuring long-term viability.\n\n## 10\\. Conclusion\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) offers substantial promise in managing and mitigating the spread of Mpox in Africa, a region that faces unique challenges in controlling this zoonotic disease. Through its ability to enhance disease surveillance, automate and refine contact tracing, optimize case management, tailor public health communication, and improve resource allocation and logistics, AI has the potential to achieve measurable improvements in Mpox management outcomes. Evidence from similar AI applications in infectious disease control suggests achievable targets including: 40–60 % reduction in outbreak detection time, 25–35 % improvement in diagnostic accuracy rates, 30–50 % decrease in contact tracing duration, 20–30 % reduction in resource allocation inefficiencies, and 15–25 % improvement in treatment response times. These technologies can transform how public health responses are conducted, enabling more timely, accurate, and effective interventions that are crucial in preventing widespread outbreaks.\n\nHowever, the successful deployment of AI in this context requires more than just technological advancements. It demands careful attention to ethical considerations, particularly in protecting data privacy and ensuring that AI applications do not exacerbate existing health inequities. Additionally, substantial investments in digital and healthcare infrastructure are necessary to support the widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in underserved and remote areas where they could have the greatest impact. Equitable access to these technologies must be a priority to ensure that all populations benefit from AI-driven public health initiatives.\n\nImmediate actionable next steps for advancing AI implementation in African Mpox management include: (1) launching multicenter validation studies across 5–10 African countries within 12 months to establish baseline performance metrics and cultural adaptation requirements; (2) developing policy advocacy roadmaps for AI integration into national health strategies through partnerships with Africa CDC and WHO Regional Office for Africa; (3) establishing standardized evaluation frameworks with specific key performance indicators for AI system assessment; (4) creating pilot implementation programs in 15–20 districts across different African regions to demonstrate feasibility and cost-effectiveness; and (5) building sustainable financing mechanisms through international development partnerships and domestic health budget allocations. These concrete steps, supported by ongoing research and development, will be essential for building resilient healthcare systems capable of responding swiftly and effectively to future public health threats. By embracing AI with a focus on equity, ethics, and collaboration, Africa can enhance its capacity to protect public health and prevent the devastating impacts of infectious diseases.\n\n### 10.1. Limitations\n\nThis narrative review has several important limitations that must be acknowledged when interpreting the findings. First, the included studies exhibited several inherent biases that may affect the validity of conclusions. Publication bias was evident, with a predominance of studies reporting positive AI outcomes while negative or inconclusive results were underrepresented in the literature. Geographic bias was substantial, as most AI implementation studies originated from high-income countries with limited direct applicability to African health systems, and the few African studies were concentrated in urban settings with better infrastructure. Additionally, temporal bias affected the review, as the rapid evolution of AI technologies rendered older studies less relevant, while newer technologies lacked sufficient real-world validation data.\n\nSecond, significant data scarcity constraints limited the comprehensiveness of this review. The paucity of empirical studies specifically addressing AI applications for Mpox management in African contexts necessitated extrapolation from related infectious disease AI implementations. Most included studies lacked long-term follow-up data on AI system sustainability and performance degradation over time. Furthermore, the absence of standardized metrics across studies made direct comparison of AI effectiveness challenging, and limited reporting of implementation costs and resource requirements hindered economic evaluation.\n\nThird, substantial generalizability constraints affect the applicability of findings across diverse African contexts. The heterogeneity of healthcare infrastructure, digital literacy levels, and technological capacity across African countries limits the universal applicability of proposed AI solutions. Cultural and linguistic diversity across the continent may affect the performance of AI systems trained on data from specific populations. Additionally, the dynamic nature of Mpox epidemiology and the emergence of new viral clades may require continuous adaptation of AI algorithms, potentially limiting the longevity of current recommendations.\n\nFinally, as a narrative review, this study is subject to methodological limitations including potential subjective bias in study selection and interpretation despite systematic screening procedures. The lack of meta-analytical techniques prevented quantitative synthesis of outcomes, and the absence of formal risk of bias assessment tools specifically designed for diverse study types may have affected quality evaluation. These limitations underscore the need for more rigorous systematic reviews and primary research studies specifically focused on AI implementation for Mpox management in African settings.\n\n### 10.2. Data availability and reproducibility statement\n\nAs a narrative review, this study does not generate primary datasets or algorithms. However, all methodological materials including complete search strategies, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction templates, quality assessment frameworks, and screening decisions are available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.\n\nThis review emphasizes the critical importance of open-source practices in AI for health applications in African settings. Future AI implementations for Mpox management should prioritize open-source algorithm development, transparent dataset sharing through public repositories (appropriately anonymized), and reproducible research practices with detailed methodological documentation. Proprietary AI solutions create implementation barriers in resource-limited settings due to cost constraints and technological dependencies.\n\nOpen science approaches enhance both scientific reproducibility and equitable access to AI-driven public health tools, enabling local adaptation and sustainable implementation across diverse African contexts. This review adheres to transparent reporting practices and encourages all AI implementation studies to adopt open science principles to maximize global health equity impact.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**David B.

The DRC alone accounts for 13,545 cases and 38 fatalities, followed by Uganda (6,051 cases) and Sierra Leone (4,610 cases).\n\nWhile WHO data indicates a recent decline in new infections—particularly in DRC and Sierra Leone—health authorities caution that the trend may be misleading due to testing delays, inconsistent surveillance, and waning response resources in many affected areas.\n\n**_Resurgence and global alert status_**\n\nThe mpox virus, formerly known as monkeypox, is endemic to Central and West Africa, but drew global attention after international outbreaks in 2022–2023. Though the WHO lifted its global health emergency designation in May 2023, the status was reinstated in August 2024 amid a fresh resurgence.\n\nThe current outbreak has raised concerns about health system fatigue and resource constraints, particularly in conflict-affected countries like the DRC where routine disease surveillance remains fragile.\n\n**_Public health priorities_**\n\nHealth officials are calling for sustained international support, improved access to testing and vaccines, and cross-border coordination to contain the spread of mpox across the continent. The WHO continues to monitor the outbreak and is expected to issue updated technical guidance for national health ministries this month.\n\nThe mpox virus is primarily spread through close physical contact, including skin-to-skin contact with infected individuals, contaminated objects, or bodily fluids. It causes fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, and can be fatal in vulnerable populations if not treated promptly.\n\nTAGGED: [Africa](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/tag/africa/) [DRC](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/tag/drc/) [Mpox](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/tag/mpox/)\n\nShare This Article\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected&url=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F&via=africa_dne) [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F&media=https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-14-at-11.01.31-PM.jpeg&description=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected) [Whatsapp](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected%20%E2%98%9E%20https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F) [Whatsapp](whatsapp://send?text=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected%20%E2%98%9E%20https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F) [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F&title=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F&title=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected) [Telegram](https://t.me/share/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fafrica.dailynewsegypt.com%2Fover-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected%2F&text=Over+26%2C000+Mpox+Cases+Reported+Across+Africa+in+2025%2C+DRC+Most+Affected) [Email](mailto:?subject=Over%2026,000%20Mpox%20Cases%20Reported%20Across%20Africa%20in%202025,%20DRC%20Most%20Affected%20BODY=I%20found%20this%20article%20interesting%20and%20thought%20of%20sharing%20it%20with%20you.%20Check%20it%20out:%20https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/over-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected/) [Copy Link](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/over-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected/#) [More](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/over-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected/#)\n\n![](https://foxiz.themeruby.com/network/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/network.svg)![](https://foxiz.themeruby.com/network/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/footer-logo.png)\n\nWelcome Back!\n\nSign in to your account\n\nUsername or Email Address\n\nPassword\n\nRemember me\n\n[Lost your password?](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword)\n\n[back to top](https://africa.dailynewsegypt.com/over-26000-mpox-cases-reported-across-africa-in-2025-drc-most-affected/#top)",
