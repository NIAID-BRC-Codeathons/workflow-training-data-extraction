Despite being known for some time, how the virus changes and adapts is not well understood. In this study, we examined the genetic information of Mpox virus from 13 African countries to see how they differ and evolve. We identified two major types of the virus, with one detected in East and Central Africa and the other in West and Southern Africa. We also discovered changes in the virus’ genes that may help it avoid the immune system or affect how it replicates. These insights can help improve the monitoring of Mpox outbreaks and support better public health responses. However, more laboratory work is needed to confirm the effects of these genetic changes.\n\n**Keywords:** Mpox virus, MPXV evolution, genetic diversity, APOBEC3 mutations, immune evasion, phylogenetics, protein stability\n\n## Abstract\n\nMpox, caused by the Mpox virus (MPXV), is a re-emerging zoonotic disease in the Poxviridae family. Since 2022, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced recurrent outbreaks, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accounting for 96% of the 567 confirmed cases reported in the African region by the World Health Organization as of June 2024. Despite MPXV’s endemic presence, its genomic diversity and evolutionary dynamics remain poorly characterized. We analyzed 270 MPXV genomes from 13 sub-Saharan African countries (2022–2024), representing the most geographically comprehensive regional dataset from the outbreak period. Phylogenetic analysis identified two geographically distinct clades: Clade I (East/Central Africa) and Clade II (West/Southern Africa). A marked disparity in APOBEC3-associated mutations was observed, with Clade IIb exhibiting significantly higher enrichment than Clade I, suggesting clade-specific host adaptation pressures. These mutations predominantly target genes involved in immune evasion and replication. Preliminary functional predictions indicated that selected missense mutations may impact on protein stability, underscoring the need for further experimental validation. Our findings provide the first pan–sub-Saharan analysis of MPXV clade divergence and reinforce the importance of sustained, regionally informed genomic surveillance to monitor viral evolution and guide outbreak response strategies across Africa.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nMPXV is a double-stranded DNA virus of the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, and genus Orthopoxvirus, which also includes Variola virus (smallpox), Vaccinia virus (used in smallpox vaccines), and Cowpox virus \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B1-biology-14-00773)\\]. First identified in 1958 in captive monkeys in Copenhagen, MPXV became a recognized human pathogen in 1970, following an infection in a 9-month-old child in the DRC \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B2-biology-14-00773)\\]. Historically, mpox infections were restricted to Central and West Africa, typically resulting from zoonotic spillovers with limited human-to-human transmission. However, in 2022, a significant epidemiological shift occurred. Mpox cases surged globally, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B3-biology-14-00773), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B4-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\nMPXV is a large, linear double-stranded DNA virus with a ~190 kb genome encoding over 190 proteins ( [Figure S1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)). Its genome has a conserved central region (~32–138 kb) that encodes essential replication enzymes and structural proteins, flanked by variable terminal regions containing inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) involved in host interaction, immune evasion, and virulence \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B1-biology-14-00773), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B5-biology-14-00773)\\] ( [Figure S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)). Open reading frames (ORFs) follow the standard orthopoxvirus nomenclature (e.g., OPG001) \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B6-biology-14-00773)\\]. Key ORFs encode DNA and RNA polymerases, envelope proteins, and virulence factors such as complement regulatory proteins \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B1-biology-14-00773), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B7-biology-14-00773)\\] ( [File S1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)).\n\nMpox is classified into two principal clades designated as Clade I (Central African) and Clade II (West African), with further subdivisions into Clades Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb, respectively \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B8-biology-14-00773)\\]. Clade I is historically associated with higher morbidity and mortality, disproportionately affecting children and immunocompromised individuals, whereas Clade II has been implicated in the recent global outbreaks, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B8-biology-14-00773)\\]. Mpox however remains endemic in the sub-Saharan countries including DRC, Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Nigeria, with reported cases in Ghana \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B9-biology-14-00773)\\]. The natural reservoir of MPXV remains unknown, although zoonotic transmission is suspected to be caused by African rodents and non-human primates \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B10-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\nOn a global scale, multiple mpox outbreaks have been reported in over 130 countries by April 2025, with sustained human-to-human transmission \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B11-biology-14-00773)\\]. The 2022–2024 outbreaks in Europe, North America, and Asia also demonstrated novel transmission dynamics, including sexual transmission networks and asymptomatic carriers \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B11-biology-14-00773), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B12-biology-14-00773), [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B13-biology-14-00773)\\]. While Clade II remains dominant in these outbreaks, more recent genomic analyses have identified mutations consistent with APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase activity, characterized by GA-to-AA and TC-to-TT substitutions \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B1-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\nSeveral public health efforts have been coordinated by WHO to curb the spread of mpox. These include targeted vaccination strategies, enhanced surveillance, and support for rapid diagnostic capacities. However, vaccine access remains inequitable, particularly in endemic regions of Africa \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B14-biology-14-00773), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B15-biology-14-00773)\\]. By August 2024, over 20,000 suspected cases and 500 deaths had been reported in the DRC \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B16-biology-14-00773)\\], hence emphasizing the important need for increased genomic surveillance, equitable vaccine distribution, and international collaboration to mitigate mpox outbreaks.\n\nDespite recent advances, the genetic evolution and diversity of MPXV across sub-Saharan Africa remain underexplored. Most phylogenomic studies have focused on Clade IIb viruses from non-endemic countries \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B17-biology-14-00773), [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B18-biology-14-00773), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B19-biology-14-00773), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B20-biology-14-00773)\\], while African studies have largely been limited to single-country datasets \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B21-biology-14-00773), [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B22-biology-14-00773), [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B23-biology-14-00773), [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B24-biology-14-00773)\\], restricting broader evolutionary insights. To address this gap, we conducted the first pan–sub-Saharan genomic analysis of 270 MPXV genomes from 13 countries (2022–2024). This study investigates regional lineage divergence, APOBEC3-mediated mutational signatures, and the potential functional effects of key non-synonymous mutations. Our findings provide critical insights into MPXV’s evolutionary dynamics and underscore the importance of genomic surveillance, vaccine updates, and outbreak preparedness across both endemic and emerging regions.\n\n## 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\nComplete genome sequences of the MPXV were retrieved from GISAID EpiPox (400 sequences) (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) ( [https://gisaid.org/](https://gisaid.org/)) (accessed on 4 March 2025) covering the period between 1 January 2022, and 31 December 2024. Accession numbers were selected from 13 African countries with high Mpox prevalence throughout this time interval. Sequences underwent several curation processes for data quality. Duplicate sequences were eliminated. Sequences of sizes ranging from 190 to 205 kb were kept ensuring complete and consistent genomes. Sequences containing more than 10% ambiguous nucleotides (Ns) were excluded to ensure high-confidence data. Sequence preprocessing was carried out using Biopython scripts (Python 3.9) \\[ [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B25-biology-14-00773)\\]. After curation, 270 sequences were kept for further analysis including: DRC ( _n_ = 167), Nigeria ( _n_ = 38), Central African Republic ( _n_ = 14), Burundi ( _n_ = 9), South Africa ( _n_ = 9), Ghana ( _n_ = 7), Uganda ( _n_ = 7), Cote d’Ivoire ( _n_ = 5), Cameroon ( _n_ = 4), Liberia ( _n_ = 5), Benin ( _n_ = 2), Kenya ( _n_ = 2), and Congo ( _n_ = 1).\n\nMultiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed with MAFFT v7.526 \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B26-biology-14-00773)\\] using the auto strategy to optimize speed with an assurance of accuracy. TrimAl v1.4. rev15 (build 17 December 2013) \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B27-biology-14-00773)\\] was used to filter the alignment, applying a 0.05 gap threshold to remove poorly aligned regions. The quality of the alignment was visually inspected, using AliView v1.26 to ensure accuracy prior to downstream analyses \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B28-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\nA maximum likelihood (ML) tree was constructed using IQ-TREE v2.3.6 \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B29-biology-14-00773)\\]. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model K3Pu+F+I+R3 was selected using ModelFinder \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B30-biology-14-00773)\\] with Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values for the best fit to the data. For tree robustness, 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates were performed \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B31-biology-14-00773)\\]. The 2016 sequence (EPI\\_ISL\\_18689512) was used as an outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree and for evolutionary context. The phylogenetic tree was visualized and annotated using iTOL v7.1 with metadata \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B32-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\n### 2.2. Mutational Analysis\n\nMutational analysis was performed by aligning the reference sequence [NC\\_063383.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383.1) (MPXV, 2018) with 12 representative mutant sequences for each lineage and clades using BWA for indexing and alignment v0.7.17-r1188 \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B33-biology-14-00773)\\]. Representative sequences were randomly selected to maintain manageable dataset subsets for mutational analysis. The aligned sequences were converted from SAM to BAM format, sorted, and indexed. Variant calling was carried out with BCF tools v1.19 \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B34-biology-14-00773)\\], followed by variant annotation using snpEff v5.2e \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B35-biology-14-00773)\\]. A custom Mpox sequence database was compiled to support variant annotation, using the standard genetic code. A Python script was developed to rapidly screen for APOBEC3 mutation signatures across lineages and clades, available in the [Supplementary Material (File S3)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773) and at our GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Millicent-lab/mpox-apobec3-screening](https://github.com/Millicent-lab/mpox-apobec3-screening) (version a1ab764, accessed on 23 May 2025).\n\n### 2.3. Functional Analysi\n\nTo assess the potential biological impact of non-synonymous amino acid substitutions identified across MPXV genes, we conducted a preliminary in silico functional analysis. From the mutational dataset, six genes with the highest number of amino acid substitutions were prioritized. For each gene, three consensus mutations were selected based on their recurrence across multiple clades and lineages ( [File S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)). Functional predictions for each amino acid substitution were obtained using PolyPhen-2 ( [http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/](http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), accessed on 21 May 2025). The mutations were classified as “benign”, “possibly damaging”, or “probably damaging” based on the associated score \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B36-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\nTwo viral genes were selected for structural modeling based on the high frequency of missense mutations and the presence of at least two variants predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2. Due to the lack of suitable homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), protein structure predictions were generated using a publicly available AlphaFold-based web server ( [https://alphafoldserver.com/](https://alphafoldserver.com/), accessed on 29 May 2025), which utilizes the AlphaFold2 \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B37-biology-14-00773)\\] algorithm for tertiary structure prediction, using the MPXV reference genome [NC\\_063383.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383.1) as input. Model quality was evaluated using pLDDT scores \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B37-biology-14-00773)\\], where values above 70 generally indicate reliable backbone predictions, and further validated through stereochemical assessment using PROCHECK \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B38-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\nThe impact of the mutations on protein stability was assessed using the DynaMut web server ( [https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/dynamut2](https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/dynamut2), accessed on 27 May 2025) \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B39-biology-14-00773)\\]. Wild-type structures were used as input, and predicted changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔΔG) were calculated to estimate the impact of mutations on protein stability. Positive ΔΔG values indicate stabilizing mutations, while negative values indicate destabilizing effects.\n\nConservation scores were calculated for the wild-type protein to provide a comprehensive view of residue conservation using the ConSurf web server ( [https://consurf.tau.ac.il](https://consurf.tau.ac.il/), accessed on 27 May 2025) \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B40-biology-14-00773)\\] based on the MSA of orthologous Orthopoxvirus proteins.\n\n## 3\\. Results\n\n### 3.1. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of 270 curated MPXV sequences from Sub-Saharan Africa identified two major clades: Clade I (Ia, Ib) and Clade II (IIa, IIb), with distinct evolutionary and temporal patterns ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f001) and [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f002)). Notably a long divergent branch marked the transition from Lineage A.3 to B.1. Clade I (Ia and Ib) was predominant in Central and East African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda, Burundi, Central African Republic (CAR), Kenya, and the Republic of Congo. Clade II was mainly observed in West and Southern Africa, with IIb reported in countries including South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, and Cameroon, and IIa detected in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire.\n\n#### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f2b5/12292466/e4c73358e2f4/biology-14-00773-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12292466_biology-14-00773-g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/figure/biology-14-00773-f001/)\n\nPhylogenetic tree of MPXV sequences (January 2022–December 2024) retrieved from GISAID on 4 March 2025.

Clade IIb dominated in 2022 (notably in Nigeria); Clade Ia peaked in 2023 then declined; Clade Ib rose in 2023 and peaked in 2024; Clade I remained prevalent in DRC through 2022 to 2024.\n\nClade IIb diverged into several sub-lineages; A, A.2, A.2.2, A.2.3, A.3, B.1, B.17, and F.2 as defined by the GISAID EpiPox classification and supported by strong phylogenetic clustering and high bootstrap values ( [https://gisaid.org/hmpxv-epipox](https://gisaid.org/hmpxv-epipox), accessed on 27 May 2025) \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B23-biology-14-00773)\\] ( [File S4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)).\n\nTemporal distribution analysis revealed evolving lineage dynamics across the three-year period ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f002)). In 2022, multiple lineages co-circulated, including Clade Ia, IIb, and several IIb sub-lineages (A, A.2, A.2.2, A.2.3, A.3, B.1, and B.17). In 2023, Clade Ia peaked, Clade Ib emerged, and IIb sub-lineages A, A.2, A.2.3, and A.3 remained in circulation. By 2024, Clade Ia declined while Clade Ib became dominant. Notably, Clade IIa appeared exclusively in 2024, alongside the continued circulation of IIb sub-lineages A.2.2 and F.2 ( [Table S1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)).\n\n### 3.2. Mutational Analysis\n\nThe mutational analysis of MPXV genomes revealed notable non-synonymous amino acid substitutions relative to the reference genome [NC\\_063383.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383.1) (MPXV, 2018). A focused examination of consensus mutations identified the most frequently altered genes across clades, selected based on their cumulative missense mutation burden. The OPG210 gene exhibited the highest mutation frequency, followed by OPG023, OPG118, OPG145, OPG205, OPG105, OPG153, OPG071, OPG047, and OPG188 ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) B).\n\n#### Figure 3.\n\n[![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f2b5/12292466/759deccf2ad8/biology-14-00773-g003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12292466_biology-14-00773-g003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/figure/biology-14-00773-f003/)\n\n( **A**) Bar plot shows the top MPXV genes based on the frequency of APOBEC3-associated mutations. These mutations, known to arise from host antiviral activity, were predominantly observed in genes involved in immune modulation (blue) and viral replication/transcription (orange). ( **B**) Heatmap illustrates the cumulative frequency of non-synonymous (missense) mutations across major MPXV genes and clades, using [NC\\_063383.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383.1) (Clade IIbA) as the reference genome. The color intensity corresponds to the absolute number of missense mutations per gene per clade, with darker shades indicating higher mutation counts. Notably, OPG210 showed the highest mutation frequency overall, particularly within Clade I, followed by OPG023 and OPG105 which showed pronounced mutation levels in Clade I and Clade IIbA.2.3, respectively.\n\nClade-specific mutational patterns emerged, with Clade I showing the highest number of substitutions overall, particularly in OPG023, OPG210, and OPG205. Within Clade IIb, Lineage B.1 displayed elevated mutation counts in OPG210 compared to Lineage A, while Lineage IIbA.2.3 exhibited the greatest number of substitutions in OPG105 relative to the reference genome ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) B).\n\nOverall, 54.65% of observed mutations were synonymous, while 45.35% were non-synonymous. Among these, 34.55% of synonymous and 41.89% of non-synonymous mutations bore APOBEC3-associated mutation signatures ( [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-t001)). Clade IIb harbored the highest proportion of APOBEC3-mediated variants, particularly in Lineage B.1 and its sub-lineages (B.17 and F.2), which averaged 88.34% of synonymous and 90.14% of non-synonymous mutations. Conversely, Clade I exhibited the lowest proportions of APOBEC3-associated variants, with averages of 27.54% (synonymous) and 25.69% (non-synonymous). Genes enriched for APOBEC3 mutations were predominantly those involved in host immune modulation as well as viral replication and transcription ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) A).\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nDistribution of synonymous, non-synonymous, and APOBEC3 variants across lineages/clades.\n\n| Clade/Lineage | Synonymous Variants | % APOBEC3 (Synonymous) | Non-Synonymous Variants | % APOBEC3 <br>(NON-Synonymous) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| IIa | 137 | 29.20% (40/137) | 124 | 25.81% (32/124) |\n| IIbA.2.3 | 15 | 73.33% (11/15) | 31 | 74.19% (23/31) |\n| IIbA.2 | 12 | 75.00% (9/12) | 22 | 95.45% (21/22) |\n| IIbA.3 | 28 | 46.43% (13/28) | 55 | 38.18% (21/55) |\n| IIbA | 7 | 0.00% (0/7) | 8 | 25.00% (2/8) |\n| IIb | 23 | 13.04% (3/23) | 23 | 8.70% (2/23) |\n| Ia | 364 | 26.65% (97/364) | 240 | 24.17% (58/240) |\n| IIbB1 | 27 | 88.89% (24/27) | 32 | 90.63% (29/32) |\n| IIbF.2 | 38 | 86.84% (33/38) | 33 | 90.91% (30/33) |\n| IIbB.17 | 28 | 89.29% (25/28) | 36 | 88.89% (32/36) |\n| Ib | 380 | 28.42% (108/380) | 261 | 27.20% (71/261) |\n| IIbA.2.2 | 9 | 66.67% (6/9) | 21 | 95.24% (20/21) |\n| Total | 1068(54.65%) | 34.55% (369/1068) | 886(45.35%) | 41.89% (371/886) |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/table/biology-14-00773-t001/)\n\n### 3.3. Functional Analysis\n\nWhile the majority of substitutions were predicted to be benign, several exhibited high PolyPhen-2 scores ( [File S8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)), suggesting potential functional impacts. These included, R689C in OPG205 (0.999), L602I in OPG023 (0.659), S734L in OPG105 (0.683), R243Q (0.996) and E435K (0.948) in OPG145, and D209N (0.999) and P722S (0.640) in OPG210 ( [Files S2 and S6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)) \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B28-biology-14-00773)\\]. OPG210 and OPG145 were prioritized for structural and stability analyses as both harbored two high-impact mutations and are functionally implicated in immune modulation and DNA helicase activity, respectively. Protein structure predictions yielded overall pLDDT scores of 65.94 for OPG210 and 86.41 for OPG145, corresponding to low and high-confidence models, respectively ( [Figure 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f004); [File S6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)) \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B29-biology-14-00773)\\]. While local stereochemical features of both models were acceptable ( [File S7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)) \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B30-biology-14-00773)\\], the global confidence of the OPG210 structure was limited. Stability predictions were subsequently conducted to evaluate the structural impact of these variants, although results for OPG210 should be interpreted with caution due to its model’s lower reliability.\n\n#### Figure 4.\n\n[![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f2b5/12292466/eecffba990be/biology-14-00773-g004.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12292466_biology-14-00773-g004.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/figure/biology-14-00773-f004/)\n\nPredicted 3D wildtype structures of OPG210 (left) and OPG145 (right) colored by pLDDT confidence scores. Dark blue: very high confidence (pLDDT > 90); light blue: confident (70–90); yellow: low confidence (50–70); orange: very low confidence (<50).\n\nStability and conservation analyses indicated that the D209N mutation in OPG210 was stabilizing (+1.2 kcal/mol) and located at a mildly variable site adjacent to a highly conserved region. Conversely, the P722S substitution in OPG210 was slightly destabilizing (−0.16 kcal/mol) and occurred within a highly variable region. In OPG145, the R243Q mutation was destabilizing (−0.54 kcal/mol) and mapped to a highly conserved residue, whereas E435K was stabilizing (+0.51 kcal/mol) and situated within a moderately conserved region flanked by conserved residues ( [Figure 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f005); [File S6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)) \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B30-biology-14-00773), [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B31-biology-14-00773)\\].\n\n#### Figure 5.\n\n[![Figure 5](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f2b5/12292466/69dc11a248b5/biology-14-00773-g005.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12292466_biology-14-00773-g005.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/figure/biology-14-00773-f005/)\n\nConservation profiles of OPG210 (1–750 aa segment shown) and full-length OPG145 (1–492 aa) generated using the ConSurf web server.

Discussion\n\nOur pan–sub-Saharan phylogenetic analysis confirms the co-circulation of Clade I (Ia/Ib) and Clade II (IIa/IIb) and offers new insights into their regional distribution and evolutionary trajectories. While prior studies have described MPXV genetic diversity \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B1-biology-14-00773), [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B17-biology-14-00773), [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B18-biology-14-00773), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B19-biology-14-00773), [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B20-biology-14-00773)\\], this is the first to resolve lineage-specific patterns across 13 endemic African countries. We corroborate Isidro et al.’s \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B18-biology-14-00773)\\] (p. 1) observation of a long divergent branch separating Lineage A from B.1, indicative of accelerated microevolution ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f002)). We extend this finding by identifying a higher burden of non-synonymous substitutions in the immune evasion gene OPG210 in Lineage B.1 compared to Lineage A ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) B; [Figure S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)). This suggests ongoing adaptive evolution potentially shaped by regional host immune pressures, an underexplored pattern in African MPXV strains.\n\nWhile Clade I’s endemicity in Central Africa and the DRC is well established \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B14-biology-14-00773)\\], our analysis reveals broader regional clustering of Clade Ib strains across Kenya, Burundi, Uganda, and the DRC ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f002)) \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B41-biology-14-00773)\\]. Although previous in-country reports have noted possible cross-border transmission \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B42-biology-14-00773), [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B43-biology-14-00773), [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B44-biology-14-00773)\\], this study provides the most geographically expansive phylogenetic evidence of Clade Ib circulation across East and Central Africa. However, the absence of linked metadata such as travel history or case contact information limits definitive conclusions about transmission routes. These findings underscore the need for integrated genomic and epidemiological surveillance to better understand MPXV spread dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOur analysis confirms the predominance of APOBEC3-mediated mutations (GA>AA/TC>TT) in Clade IIb Lineage B.1 \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B1-biology-14-00773), [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B18-biology-14-00773)\\], and reveals gene-specific APOBEC3 editing, with selective enrichment in immune-modulatory genes OPG210, OPG047, and OPG003 ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) A). Clade IIb exhibits approximately a threefold higher mutation burden than Clade I ( [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-t001)), supporting the hypothesis of host-driven adaptation \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B45-biology-14-00773), [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B46-biology-14-00773)\\], particularly in viral immune evasion proteins. Functional validation of these mutations’ fitness impacts remains essential. Conversely, Clade I shows a low APOBEC3 editing burden (<30%), dominated instead by non-canonical mutations ( [File S5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)), indicating alternative mutational strategies. Similar phenomena have been observed in gamma-herpesviruses \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B47-biology-14-00773)\\] and HIV-1 \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B48-biology-14-00773)\\] under comparable selective pressures. The discordance between Clade I’s low APOBEC3 signature and its expanding geographic range implies alternative adaptation mechanisms such as enhanced polymerase fidelity or reservoir-specific selection that warrant systematic investigation.\n\nWe also observed that MPXV evolution is shaped by differential selection on synonymous (54.65%) and non-synonymous (45.35%) mutations ( [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-t001)). Although synonymous mutations do not alter protein sequences, they may impact viral fitness through codon usage bias, RNA structural stability, or translational efficiency \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B49-biology-14-00773), [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B50-biology-14-00773)\\]. This is supported by their distinct distribution in virulent Central African versus attenuated West African strains \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B51-biology-14-00773)\\]. Notably, non-synonymous mutations predominate in Clade IIb B.1 isolates relative to the 2018 reference genome ( [NC\\_063383.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383.1)) ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) B), suggesting strong positive selection driving protein evolution. This trend aligns with recent findings of accelerated amino acid substitutions and reduced codon adaptation index (CAI) in 2022 outbreak strains \\[ [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B52-biology-14-00773), [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B53-biology-14-00773)\\], implying that MPXV may be undergoing an adaptive shift in which protein innovation supersedes codon optimization during host adaptation. Together, these findings highlight the interplay of mutation types in shaping MPXV evolution and pathogenicity.\n\nClade-specific mutations further illuminate potential adaptive pathways in MPXV. Compared to the 2018 Clade IIb reference ( [NC\\_063383.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_063383.1)), recent Clade IIb A.2.3 strains harbor concentrated mutations in OPG105 ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) B), a transcriptional regulator ( [Figure S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)) potentially involved in replication optimization \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B20-biology-14-00773), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B54-biology-14-00773)\\]. Meanwhile, Clade I (hyperendemic in Africa) exhibits distinct variation in immune-related genes OPG210, OPG205, and OPG023 ( [File S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773); [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f003) B), reflecting both ancestral divergence and recent adaptation. Similar gene changes have been shown to enhance viral fitness in other poxviruses \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B55-biology-14-00773)\\]. These genetic signatures may underpin clade-specific transmission patterns, although functional validation remains necessary.\n\nSeveral methodological limitations should be acknowledged. Our reliance on a single reference genome and consensus sequences limited the detection of lineage-specific and low-frequency variants, potentially obscuring intra-host diversity. The absence of raw sequencing data further restricted variant resolution. Additionally, APOBEC3 mutation profiling was hindered by incomplete metadata, precluding correlation with clinical or epidemiological outcomes. Nevertheless, the mutational hotspots identified here represent candidates of potential functional significance. Future studies incorporating deep sequencing and richer patient-level data will be vital to fully elucidate MPXV evolutionary dynamics.\n\nOur integrated functional analysis framework offers mechanistic insights into MPXV protein evolution. We identify the R243Q mutation in OPG145, predicted to be destabilizing (ΔΔG = –0.54 kcal/mol) and occurring at a universally conserved residue ( [Figure 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f005)) that is indicative of strong evolutionary constraint. This mirrors replication-defective D5 helicase mutants in vaccinia virus, such as Dts6389, where insolubility and impaired multimerization disrupt replication \\[ [56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B56-biology-14-00773)\\]. Given OPG145’s confirmed helicase function ( [Figure S2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)), the R243Q mutation likely impairs viral replication through similar biophysical mechanisms, a hypothesis testable via ATPase activity and thermal shift assays.\n\nWe also identify stabilizing mutations, E435K in OPG145 (ΔΔG = +0.51 kcal/mol) and D209N in OPG210 (ΔΔG = +1.2 kcal/mol) located near conserved functional regions ( [Figure 5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#biology-14-00773-f005)). These may counterbalance destabilizing variants, exemplifying compensatory stabilization \\[ [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B57-biology-14-00773), [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B58-biology-14-00773), [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B59-biology-14-00773)\\] ( [File S6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#app1-biology-14-00773)). In contrast, mildly destabilizing variants such as OPG210-P722S (ΔΔG = –0.16 kcal/mol) located in highly variable regions, though individually tolerated, may cumulatively shape protein evolution. As noted by Tokuriki and Tawfik \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12292466/#B59-biology-14-00773)\\] (p. 1), mutations that cross a destabilization threshold can reduce protein solubility and impair its function. Although the structural resolution of the OPG210 model limits atomic interpretation, our integrative approach highlights OPG145-R243Q and OPG210-D209N as priority targets for cryo-EM structural studies and functional assays. These findings offer a methodological framework for dissecting MPXV protein function through integrated structural and evolutionary approaches.\n\n## 5\\. Conclusions\n\nThis study underscores the ongoing evolution of MPXV in sub-Saharan Africa, characterized by the diversification of Clade IIb and the emergence of region-specific sub-lineages. These trends reflect the virus’ adaptability across diverse ecological and geographic landscapes. The predominance of APOBEC3-mediated mutations and the elevated burden of non-synonymous substitutions suggest sustained host-driven adaptation, likely influenced by immune selection pressures and evolving transmission dynamics.\n\nThese genomic signatures serve as early indicators of potential shifts in viral behavior and carry direct public health significance. They highlight the urgency of real-time genomic surveillance to detect emerging variants, inform vaccine updates, and enhance outbreak preparedness, particularly in endemic and high-risk regions.\n\nImportantly, our findings raise critical questions about the functional consequences of mutations in immune-modulatory and transcriptional regulatory genes. Future work should prioritize experimental validation of these candidates to determine their roles in MPXV transmissibility and pathogenicity. Continued integration of genomic and epidemiological data will be essential to inform targeted and timely public health responses.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the authors and laboratories who submitted MPXV sequences to the GISAID database, enabling this research.

In this paper we present the results of genomic characterization and analyses of mechanisms of human adaptation, including APOBEC-style mutations, performed on 11 MPXV isolates, collected from May to September 2022, from Emilia-Romagna (Italy). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed all strains belonged to Clade IIb. Viruses from male patients were classified within lineage B (sub-lineages B.1, B.1.3, B.1.12), while a strain from a female patient was assigned to lineage A (A.2.3), with epidemiological links to Ghana. This represents the fourth detection of an A.2.3 strain of African origin outside the continent. Disruptions were identified in two genes: OPG176 (similar to VACV-Cop A46R), as reported in lineage A, and OPG023 (similar to VACV-Cop D7L), resulting in protein truncation that may suggest a possible pattern of human adaptation. These findings further enhance our understanding of MPXV Clade IIb diversity through characterization of a rarer variant giving insights from a less explored epidemiological pathway.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-46949-7/MediaObjects/41467_2024_46949_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Monkeypox virus genomic accordion strategies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46949-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access18 April 2024\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-024-03370-3/MediaObjects/41591_2024_3370_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Global genomic surveillance of monkeypox virus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03370-3?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access23 October 2024\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-022-01907-y/MediaObjects/41591_2022_1907_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Phylogenomic characterization and signs of microevolution in the 2022 multi-country outbreak of monkeypox virus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01907-y?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access24 June 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nMonkeypox virus (MPXV) species in the genus Orthopoxvirus, _Poxviridae_ family, includes two major clades, the formerly Congo Basin (clade I) and West Africa (clade II). According to the WHO global Mpox trends[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR1 \"World Health Organization. Global Mpox Trends. https: (2051).                    https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/_w_8e9ee070dc1f45c3a0de2051c28804d9/#overview                                    de28804d9/#overview (2025).\")the current landscape is characterized by the spread of different sub-clades of clades I (Ia and Ib) and clade II (IIa and IIb) showing varied transmission pathways and impacting diverse populations in different geographic regions. Clade Ia is endemic in multiple Central African countries and characterized by spillovers to humans from animal reservoirs with reported human to human transmission. A concerning development has been the emergence in 2023 of clade Ib, a novel variant of clade I, which spreads primarily through sexual networks[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR2 \"Srivastava, S. et al. Clade ib: a new emerging threat in the Mpox outbreak. Front. Pharmacol. 15, 1504154 (2024).\"), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR3 \"Cevik, M. et al.

Clade Ib first appeared among sex workers in Kamituga, DRC and now affects different provinces in the country. Cases were reported also in other countries in Africa, particularly Burundi and Uganda, and outside the continent due to travelling. Clade Ib is undergoing sustained human to human transmission, causing severe clinical symptoms in all age groups, especially in young children getting infected through household contacts[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR2 \"Srivastava, S. et al. Clade ib: a new emerging threat in the Mpox outbreak. Front. Pharmacol. 15, 1504154 (2024).\"). Clade IIa is spread in Western and Central Africa being responsible of a limited number of cases in humans as primarily associated with animals[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR1 \"World Health Organization. Global Mpox Trends. https: (2051).                    https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/_w_8e9ee070dc1f45c3a0de2051c28804d9/#overview                                    de28804d9/#overview (2025).\").\n\nIn 2022, the world experienced the global re-emergence of MPXV showing unique features with the highest number of cases being associated with human-to-human transmission and affecting mainly young men who identify as gay or bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), with different clinical presentations[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR4 \"Soheili, M. et al. Monkeypox: virology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, epidemiology, vaccines, diagnosis, and treatments. J. Pharm. Pharm. Sci. 25, 297–322 (2022).\"). Only few clinical cases were reported in women[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR5 \"Fusco, D. et al. A sex and gender perspective for neglected zoonotic diseases. Front. Microbiol. 13, 1031683 (2022).\"). The causative B.1 global lineage belongs to MPXV clade IIb, referred to as hMPXV1[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR6 \"Happi, C. et al. Urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatizing nomenclature for Monkeypox virus. PLoS Biol 20, (2022).\"), was imported from West Africa. In 2017, West Africa and particularly Nigeria experienced the largest MPXV outbreak in history, showing a marked demographic shift with more infected individuals of 30 to 40 years and higher incidence in urban settings[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR7 \"Parker, E. et al. Genomic epidemiology uncovers the timing and origin of the emergence of Mpox in humans. Preprint At.                    https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.18.24309104                                     (2024).\"). In September 2018, for the first time, a human host was identified as the cause of MPXV transfer from Africa to Europe and Asia[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR8 \"Chowdhury, P. P. D., Haque, M. A., Ahamed, B., Tanbir, M. & Islam, M. R. A brief report on Monkeypox outbreak 2022: historical perspective and disease pathogenesis. Clin. Pathol. 15, 2632010X221131660 (2022).\").\n\nSince the identification of the B.1 lineage, several countries have reported other lineages that fall outside the B.1 diversity[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR9 \"O’Toole, Á. et al. APOBEC3 deaminase editing in Mpox virus as evidence for sustained human transmission since at least 2016. Sci. (1979). 382, 595–600 (2023).\"). In fact, multiple clade IIb viruses designated as lineage A.2 have been found outside Africa since 2017. This lineage was shown to be circulating out of Africa before the global B.1 outbreak being sustained by human-to-human transmission. It was speculated that lineage A originated from a single zoonotic event and persisted in the human population for years.\n\nBefore the global 2022 outbreak, most of the MPXV research was focused on the African continent, particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, however, very few sequences from human cases had been filed in databases. Following the pandemic, the study sites and provenance of research groups on MPXV diversified, with publications of numerous case reports from many parts of the world[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR10 \"De Pascali, A. M. et al. Zoonotic orthopoxviruses after smallpox eradication: A shift from crisis response to a one health approach. IJID One Health. 2, 100018 (2024).\"). Nonetheless, active genomic and disease surveillance was not carried out with uniformity in all affected countries. Genomes published during the 2022 outbreak to date were attributed to a common ancestor with MPXV sequences from Nigeria (Clade IIb). Several authors[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR9 \"O’Toole, Á. et al. APOBEC3 deaminase editing in Mpox virus as evidence for sustained human transmission since at least 2016. Sci. (1979). 382, 595–600 (2023).\") observed that clade IIb MPXV are evolving at higher rates compared to what is expected from a double-stranded DNA virus and reported an increased mutational signature in response to the action of human APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide) deaminases, a host enzyme with antiviral function. APOBEC genomic editing was claimed to be a characteristic feature of the sustained transmission in the human population as it was not observed in sequences from zoonotic infections[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR11 \"Parker, E. et al. Genomic epidemiology uncovers the timing and origin of the emergence of Mpox in humans. MedRxiv                    https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.18.24309104                                     (2024).\"). On the other hand, the limited availability of sequences from Nigeria’s neighboring countries may have created a bias in our understanding of viral evolution and phylogenetic relationships, as most of the genomic data come from viruses linked to or identified in this country[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR12 \"Gigante, C. M. et al. Multiple lineages of Monkeypox virus detected in the united states, 2021–2022. Sci. (1979). 378, 560–565 (2022).\").\n\nThe scarcity of information makes it complex to fully understand the evolutionary dynamics of the virus in its less explored epidemiological pathways: outside the target MSM community and in countries that carried out less punctual epidemiological and molecular surveillance compared to Nigeria.\n\nIn this study, whole-genome sequencing was conducted on 11 MPXV isolated in Emilia Romagna (Italy) in 2022. Our findings show the co-circulation of clade IIb viruses of sub-lineages A in addition to the most widely reported viruses belonging to lineage B, during the 2022 pandemic. In fact, the infection in the only female patient, traced back to Ghana, was caused by a strain belonging to MPXV sub-lineage A.2.3. Given the limited information on lineage A variants circulating outside the African continent, we explored the evolutionary dynamics, key genomic, and amino-acid mutations of sub-lineage A.2.3 strains, to identify emergency mutations and discuss mechanisms for host adaptation. Overall, our results underline the importance of continuing to study MPXV outside its usual geographic routes and infection pathways to gain new insights on non-zoonotic spread to finally improve control and prevention strategies.\n\n## Results\n\n### Phylogenetic characteristics of MPXV isolated in Emilia-Romagna\n\nEleven MPXV strains, isolated, between May and September 2022 in Emilia Romagna, from 10 males and 1 female patients, were submitted for genomic characterization. All the MPXV samples were preliminarily tested through real-time PCR and confirmed as Clade IIb[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR13 \"Li, Y., Zhao, H., Wilkins, K., Hughes, C. & Damon, I. K. Real-time PCR assays for the specific detection of Monkeypox virus West African and congo basin strain DNA. J. Virol. Methods. 169, 223–227 (2010).\"). To explore the molecular evolution and genomic characteristics of MPXV associated with the Emilia-Romagna outbreak, isolates underwent whole-genome sequencing. An initial phylogenetic tree on Nextclade ( [https://clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org/)) confirmed that all the analyzed isolates clustered with clade IIb. By integrating the 11 MPXV sequences obtained from Emilia-Romagna with a curated dataset of 267 high-quality Clade II MPXV genomes (Supplementary Table [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#MOESM1)), phylogenetic analyses revealed that all strains isolated from male patients grouped within lineage B, being distributed across different sub-lineages: B.1 ( _n_ = 5), B.1.3 ( _n_ = 3), and B.1.12 ( _n_ = 2) (Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig1)). Specifically, the sequences hMPXV/P1/2022, hMPXV/P4/2022, hMPXV/P9/2022, hMPXV/P10/2022, and hMPXV/P15/2022 clustered within lineage B.1 with strong bootstrap support (> 80). The sequences hMPXV/P3/2022, hMPXV/P5/2022, and hMPXV/P6/2022 were grouped within lineage B.1.3, supported by high bootstrap values (> 90). While hMPXV/P7/2022 and hMPXV/P13/2022 clustered within lineage B.1.12, although with lower bootstrap support (< 50). In contrast, the isolate hMPXV/P12/2022, collected from the only female patient, clustered within lineage A, sub-lineage A.2.3. with maximal bootstrap support (100). Epidemiological data indicated that this case was linked to travelling from Ghana to Italy (Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Tab1)).\n\n**Table 1 Summary of MPXV isolates analysed in this study.**\n\n[Full size table](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/tables/1)\n\nThese results were further confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis performed using the Nextclade tool.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\n[![figure 1](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-11855-5/MediaObjects/41598_2025_11855_Fig1_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/1)\n\nPhylogenetic Analysis of 11 MPXV Genomes from Emilia-Romagna. The Maximum Likelihood tree was built based on the whole-genome alignment of the 11 Italian MPXV sequences obtained in this study, alongside 267 high-quality clade IIb MPXV genomes retrieved from NCBI GenBank (as of October 4, 2024). The tree was rooted using three clade IIa sequences, with outgroup sequences highlighted in light brown. Tree labels are color-coded by lineage. Bold red labels in the tree indicate the 11 sequences from this study emphasized in bold red. Black dots indicate bootstrap support, with only values > 70 shown, while nodes with bootstrap values < 20 were collapsed. The scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The tree was inferred using IQ-TREE v.2.1.4, with automated model selection (best fit model was HKY + F + R4 according to Bayesian Information Criterion) and 10,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. The middle annotation ring indicates the isolation location of each MPXV genome, while the outer annotation ring indicates the corresponding isolation date.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/1)\n\nSequences from lineage A and its related sub-lineages were retrieved and analysed in detail. As confirmed by sequences available in both NCBI GenBank and GISAID, most lineage A sequences have been isolated from the African continent, particularly Nigeria. In contrast, the few A.1.1 sequences, available in public databases, have been identified in a more diverse range of geographical regions, including the USA, Italy, and Thailand (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig2)).\n\n**Fig. 2**\n\n[![figure 2](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-11855-5/MediaObjects/41598_2025_11855_Fig2_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/2)\n\nGeographic distribution of MPXV A sub-lineages. The map illustrates the global distribution of MPXV A sub-lineages, highlighting their widespread presence, particularly in the southern provinces of Nigeria. The map was generated using QGIS v.3.34.14 ( [http://www.qgis.org](http://www.qgis.org/)). In cases where detailed location data was unavailable, points were placed at the centroid of the respective countries where the virus was detected. The sequences used for this analysis include all lineage A sequences downloaded from NCBI as of October 4th.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/2)\n\n### Temporal increase of SNPs and APOBEC3 associated mutations in MPXV lineage A\n\nAPOBEC analysis confirmed that early MPXV samples, isolated between 2017 and 2020, generally showed lower APOBEC mutation counts, while those isolated between 2021 and 2024 show an increased range of mutation counts, including higher values in the 15 to 35 range (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig3) A). As expected, A.2 and A.3 sub-lineages generally exhibit higher APOBEC-style mutations, mostly covering a range of 16 to 35 counts, against the range covered by lineage A and A.1 which is 5 to 15 (Fig. [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig3) B).\n\n**Fig. 3**\n\n[![figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-11855-5/MediaObjects/41598_2025_11855_Fig3_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/3)\n\nAPOBEC-associated mutations in MPXV sub-lineages over time. ( **A**) Yearly distribution of APOBEC-associated mutations per sample across different sub-lineages. Circles indicate samples retrieved from NCBI (accessed on October 4, 2024), whereas the cross denotes the sample sequenced in this study. ( **B**) Number of APOBEC-associated mutations in MPXV clade IIb A sub-lineages.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/3)\n\nIn the analyzed A.2 lineage sequences, we found on average 57.3 SNPs (σ = 24.1) per sample. The high standard deviation can be explained by the presence of two samples (GenBank Accession Number: PP853014 and PP853015) with high numbers of SNPs, 110 and 94 respectively. In the A.2.1 sub-lineage (seven samples: three from South Korea, two from the USA, one from Egypt and one from the UK) we found on average 44.4 SNPs (σ = 5.9) per sample. In the A.2.2 sub-lineage, we analyzed fourteen samples (one from the UK and thirteen from Nigeria), with an average mutation number of 72.7 (σ = 23.4). In the A.2.3 sub-lineage, 47 samples, one from Australia, one from the USA, one from Italy and 44 from Nigeria showed an average number of mutations of 56.3 (σ = 15.7).\n\n### Analysis of SNPs and APOBEC-associated mutations in sub-lineage A.2.3\n\nTo gain deeper insight into the evolution pathway of the hMPXV/P12/2022, we conducted a detailed examination of SNPs and APOBEC-associated mutations within the whole sub-lineage A.2.3. This analysis identified 36 unique polymorphisms across the genome, including 3 A/G, 15 G/A, and 18 C/T substitutions (Fig. [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig4) A). Of the observed G-to-A transitions, 54.4% occurred in an APOBEC context, of these 90.6% were specifically 5’ GA-to-AA while the remaining 9.4% were GG-to-AG. On the other hand, of the observed C-to-T transitions, 56.9% occurred in an APOBEC context, meaning a TC-to-TT mutations. The prevalent 5’ APOBEC mutation is TC-to-TT in strains of lineage A, representing 51.5% of all the APOBEC-style mutations, followed by the GA-to-AA mutation (44.0%). Considering the subset of strains of lineage A.2.3, the TC-to-TT mutation is also in this case the most present, being 50.8% of the APOBEC mutations in this subset, followed by 44.2% of GA-to-AA mutations (Fig. [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig4) B).\n\n**Fig. 4**\n\n[![figure 4](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-11855-5/MediaObjects/41598_2025_11855_Fig4_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/4)\n\nGenomic variability and APOBEC mutations in the A.2.3 sub-lineage.

The y-axis represents the absolute number of APOBEC-style mutations.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/4)\n\n### Signature mutations and gene disruption in A.2.3 sub-lineage\n\nFour specific transitions were found in genomes belonging to lineage A.2.3 at positions 57,284 (C/T), 146,223 (C/T), 170,317 (G/A), and 175,759 (C/T). These are associated with alterations to the protein primary sequence. They are in the OPG075 (Glutaredoxin-1, R72K), OPG170 (Chemokine binding protein, D186N), OPG198 and OPG205 (Ser/thr kinase, D94N) and (Ankyrin repeat protein, A35V). Overall, hMPXV/12/2022 showed a total of 47 single SNPs relative to the reference MPXV-M5312\\_HM12\\_Rivers (GenBank Accession Number: NC\\_063383) causing alterations in the primary protein sequences [14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR14 \"Mauldin, M. R. et al. Exportation of Monkeypox virus from the African continent. J. Infect. Dis. 225, 1367–1376 (2022).\"). Of these, 3 were identified as strain specific: OPG023 leading to gene disruption at position 12,207 (G/A), OPG094 at position 74,420 (C/T) and OPG143 at position 122,712 (C/T) causing amino acid changes A214V and D202N respectively in the Entry/fusion complex component similar to VACV-Cop G9R and in a soluble myristilated protein similar to VACV-Cop A16L,\n\nAnother mutation was identified at OPG188 at position 161,953 (C/A) leading to an amino acid change (P314T). This nonsynonymous mutation appeared to be shared with 2 other strains of lineage A.2.3 isolated from Nigeria in 2022 and 2023 (GISAID: EPI ISL 19256279 and 19256278) and lead to a mutation in a schlafen-like protein similar to VACV-Cop B2R.\n\nConcerning the MPXV replication complex, all the identified B sub-lineages of this study showed nonsynonymous mutations in OPG071 and OPG093 encoding respectively similar to the VACV-Cop F8L (RC catalytic subunit) and G9R (a processivity factor). In particular, a change at position 108 (F/L) of the encoded F8L and at position 30 (S/L) and 88 (D/N) of the G9R were observed. These mutations are ~ 100% prevalent in the strains that circulated during the 2022 pandemic. These mutations were not observed in the ancestor Nigeria 1971 (GenBank Accession Number: KJ642617.1) and lineage A (sub-lineages A.1, A.2, A.2.1, A.2.2, A.2.3) which conserves amino acid residues L at position 108 of the F8L and S and D at positions 30 and 88 of the G9R as identified in strains isolated by 2018. Sub-lineage A.1.1 seems to represent an exception, within the A lineage, as it resembles lineages B with F at position 108 of the F8L and L at position 30 of the G9R, while at position 88 of this protein A.1.1 shows the residue D as all the viruses of A lineage.\n\nTwo non-sense mutations were found in hMPXV/P12/2022 one of which was previously identified in other strains classified as A.2 sub-lineages. This nonsense mutation is in OPG176 encoding a IL-1/TLR signalling inhibitor similar to VACV-Cop A46R, that was reported to be compatible with APOBEC activity according to Ndodo et al.[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR15 \"Ndodo, N. et al. Distinct Monkeypox virus lineages co-circulating in humans before 2022. Nat. Med. 29, 2317–2324 (2023).\"). As previously described, this gene disruption is only found in lineage A.2. In fact, we were able to detect the mutation only in the strain A.2.3 hMPXV/P12/2022, but not in the strains belonging to B sub-lineages confirming that this genetic disruption is the consequence of hallmark adaptation event of the A.2 lineage[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR16 \"Zhang, S. et al. Evolutionary trajectory and characteristics of Mpox virus in 2023 based on a large-scale genomic surveillance in shenzhen, China. Nat Commun 15, (2024).\"). This gene disruption leads to the translation of a polypeptide of 21 amino acids, instead of a whole-length protein of 240 residues. This variant was reported to be actively circulating among human hosts in West Africa and outside[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR15 \"Ndodo, N. et al. Distinct Monkeypox virus lineages co-circulating in humans before 2022. Nat. Med. 29, 2317–2324 (2023).\").\n\nA further gene disruption was found in the hMPXV/P12/2022 in the OPG023 encoding one of the MPXV Ankyrin repeat proteins similar to VACV-Cop D7L. The nucleotide G/A substitution at position 12,207 causes the appearance of a stop codon with subsequent protein truncation at amino acid position 232 (Q/\\*), which appeared to be a very rare variant, only found in another A.2.3 lineage strain detected in Nigeria in 2022 (GISAID: EPI ISL19256202). To characterize the previously unreported effects of the gene disruption in OPG023, we queried the reference database for protein search in UniProt[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR17 \"Bateman, A. et al. UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2025. Nucleic Acids Res. 53, D609–D617 (2025).\") ( [https://www.uniprot.org/](https://www.uniprot.org/)). As expected, the 232 amino-acid residues truncated protein of hMPXV/P12/2022 (Fig. [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig5) A) showed to be 100% identical to the Ankyrin repeat-containing protein PG023 of MPXV-M5312\\_HM12\\_Rivers (UniProt ID: A0A7H0DMZ9) which is overall 660 residues long. A 94% identity was identified with the D6L protein of the Variola virus isolate Human/India/Ind3/1967 (UniProt ID: Q07045). The protein superimposition with the VARV 452 residue long protein, modeled with the homology-based platform SWISS-MODEL (Fig. [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig5) B) showed a high structural identity in the conserved ANK repeats, characterized by conserved domain of approximately 33 amino acids as originally identified in Ankyrin. These motifs have an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta-hairpin and two alpha-helices.\n\n**Fig. 5**\n\n[![figure 5](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-11855-5/MediaObjects/41598_2025_11855_Fig5_HTML.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5/figures/5)\n\nStructural modeling of hMPXV/P12/2022 and comparison with the D6L protein. ( **A**) Structural AlfaFold3 model of hMPXV/P12/2022 The protein contains 12 Ankyrin repeats from the N to the C terminus.

Our results are consistent with previous findings of Clade IIb lineage termed B.1 that rapidly disseminated around the world to cause the MPXV pandemic from 2022 on, spreading worldwide through human-to-human transmission[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR18 \"Gaspari, V. et al.

PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis 16, (2022).\").\n\nTen out of eleven MPXV strains, analyzed in this study, were isolated from male patients, that identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) presenting lesions that suggested transmission during sexual intercourse[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR10 \"De Pascali, A.

Monkeypox outbreak 2022: clinical and virological features of 30 patients at the sexually transmitted diseases centre of sant’ Orsola hospital, bologna, Northeastern Italy. J Clin. Microbiol 61, (2023).\"). These isolates were classified as sub-lineages B.1, and B.1.5 confirming previous findings from European countries including Italy[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR21 \"Loconsole, D. et al. Monkeypox virus infections in Southern italy: is there a risk for community spread?? Int J. Environ. Res. Public. Health 19, (2022).\"). MPXV classified as sub-lineage B1.12, previously reported in Ireland, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Germany[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR22 \"Scarpa, F. et al.

According to NCBI GenBank and GISAID databases, this is the first A.2.3 lineage identified in Italy with no previous reports from Ghana. In fact, so far only few genomes, identified as A.2 and A.2.2 lineages, have been uploaded from this country. Sub-lineage A.2.3 has been rarely reported outside Africa specifically in USA, Australia and Portugal probably linked to individuals travelling from Africa. As shown in Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig2), sub-linage A.2.3. was previously identified in Egypt and Benin, but it is Nigeria where this variant seems to be widely spread (Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Fig2)). Besides the 36 SNPs shared with all the A.2.3 strains. the MPXV isolates identified outside Africa do not share any other genetic variation, suggesting different sources.\n\nEnrichment of mutations, due to the editing activity of human APOBEC3 deaminase, was shown to increase in time in all A sub-lineages confirming this signature as a characteristic feature of sustained transmission in the human population[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR24 \"Forni, D., Cagliani, R., Pozzoli, U. & Sironi, M. An APOBEC3 Mutational Signature in the Genomes of Human-Infecting Orthopoxviruses. mSphere 8, (2023).\"),. The identified mutation spectrum dominated by TC-to-TT changes, have been shown to be extremely frequent in other human-specific Orthopoxviruses (OPXV) like Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox. No preference toward TC-to-TT and GA-to-AA changes is observed in zoonotic Cowpoxvirus (CPXV), suggesting the antiviral APOBEC3 enzyme exposure on the evolution of different human-infecting Orthopoxviruses. Since MPXV adapts to human hosts through mutations in genes like F8, D1L and G9R enhancing viral replication and host receptor binding[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR25 \"Cambaza, E. M. A review of the molecular Understanding of the Mpox virus (MPXV): genomics, immune evasion, and therapeutic targets. Zoonotic Dis. 5, 3 (2025).\")we analyzed the protein variants of the 2 key factors of the MPXV replication complex: F8L and G9R encoded by OPG071 and OPG093 respectively. F8L is a B DNA polymerase (DNA pol), a critical enzyme for the replication and repair of genomic DNA, while G9R is a structural homologue of the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR26 \"Da Silva, M. & Upton, C. Vaccinia virus G8R protein: A structural ortholog of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PLoS One 4, (2009).\"). While all our isolates classified as B lineage confirm to follow the typical patterns observed in the 2022 isolates, all the genomes of lineage A retain the amino acid residues identified as characteristic of the MPXV strains isolated by 2018. Alternative mutation patterns in the RC proteins were found in lineage A.1.1 genome. Given the limited availability of A1.1 sequences for the analysis, it is difficult to make any functional hypothesis on these RC key proteins of MPXV. However, this fluctuating pattern of mutations in A.1.1 key proteins of the RC seem to confirm sub-lineage A.1.1 as sister clade to lineage B, making this sub-lineage evolutionarily closer to the lineage B than to lineage A. Kannan et al.[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR27 \"Kannan, S. R. et al. Mutations in the Monkeypox virus replication complex: potential contributing factors to the 2022 outbreak. J Autoimmun 133, (2022).\") claimed that mutations in the F8L protein (L108F) and in the G9R protein (S30L and D88N), identified in the 2022 MPXV lineage B isolates, can change respectively processivity of F8L and sensitivity to nucleoside inhibitors, as well as the interaction of MPXV G9R with E4R (uracil DNA glycosylase). Given the retention of amino acid residues in two of the key RC proteins, it can be assumed that strains belonging to lineage A (except A1.1) followed a distinct evolutionary pathway compared to lineage B maintaining the functions of these proteins and sensitivity to the antiviral molecules in use[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR27 \"Kannan, S. R. et al. Mutations in the Monkeypox virus replication complex: potential contributing factors to the 2022 outbreak. J Autoimmun 133, (2022).\").\n\nA gene disruption in the OPG176 encoding A46R was shown in all the genomes belonging to the A.2.3 lineage confirming this mutation in A2 lineages as reported by Ndodo et al.[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR15 \"Ndodo, N. et al. Distinct Monkeypox virus lineages co-circulating in humans before 2022. Nat. Med. 29, 2317–2324 (2023).\"). The VACV-Cop A46R shares amino acid sequence similarity with the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain, having a key role in innate immunity and inflammation thus representing one of the poxvirus strategies to evade and neutralize the host immune response. The A46R protein is highly conserved in MPXV and it was assumed that the mutation found in all A.2 lineage, leading to the disruption of an immune modulator protein, can be considered a further sign of the virus adaptation to the human host. Since A46R was also found in Variola virus[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR28 \"Stack, J. et al. Vaccinia virus protein A46R targets multiple Toll-like-interleukin-1 receptor adaptors and contributes to virulence. J. Exp. Med. 201, 1007–1018 (2005).\")it was suggested that viral evasion of TLR-induced immunity might contribute to the virulence of Variola virus in humans[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR29 \"Honey, K. Viral immunity: new evasion tactic for vaccinia. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 5, 358–359 (2005).                    https://doi.org/10.1038/nri1617                                    \"). With the results obtained on A.2.3 sequences, we contribute to confirm that this mutation arose and persisted in the common lineage A ancestor as it spread globally. Besides A46R, we detected a further length polymorphism, caused by gene disruption, in the OPG023 encoding a D7L homologue[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR30 \"Li, Y. et al.

Previous studies performed on VACV showed that this protein is secreted by the infected host cell and interferes with the function of interleukin-18, a central signal molecule for antiviral responses by the innate and adaptive immune systems[31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR31 \"Jordan, I. et al. Deleted deletion site in a new vector strain and exceptional genomic stability of Plaque-Purified modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). Virol. Sin. 35, 212–226 (2020).\"). In MPXV, D7L has been indicated as one of the host range factors affecting the transmissibility of the virus and virulence. Several authors[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR32 \"McFadden, G. Poxvirus tropism.

An identical mutation leading to the same gene disruption was observed in only one other viral strain isolated in 2022 in Nigeria suggesting that this mutation may have arisen in a common ancestor. The truncated D7L overlaps with the D6L VARV homologue conserved domain making us speculate that this gene disruption can be a further sign of adaptation to human host given protein length reduction and truncation are known strategies used in OPXVs hosts adaptation. The fact that similar protein structures are found in VARV, the only OPXV with human-restricted host range, may also suggest that phenotypic effects are not preventing the biological activity of the truncated protein, but experimental analysis will be required to confirm this hypothesis. The vast majority of poxvirus ANK repeat proteins share a general molecular architecture that includes a conserved amino acid motif (F-box-like domain) at the carboxyl terminus interacting with cellular ubiquitin ligase complexes. F-box motifs are also known as Pox protein repeats of ankyrin C-terminal (PRANC) domains[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR34 \"Bratke, K.

In this study, we set up a methodology whose key feature is its ability to not only detect APOBEC style, but also to specifically classify APOBEC-signature mutations, defined as those mutations falling entirely within a single codon. This functionality enables high-resolution mapping of the functional impact of APOBEC mutations.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first pipeline in the literature that implements a dual-level filtering approach for APOBEC mutations, combining the selection of specific APOBEC-style mutations with a codon-specific verification step to identify mutations of potentially functional and evolutionary relevance.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that, to improve or understanding of MPXV evolutionary strategies enhancing adaptation to the human species, it is vital to explore further genomic regions. The results, obtained on the F8L and G9R factors, contribute to widen the knowledge on the dynamics that led to the emergence of lineages A and B of MPXV clade IIb.\n\nFinally, the study of gene disruptions and protein length polymorphisms represents an additional source for understanding the MPXV evolutionary strategies. The identified D7L protein truncation may represent a less explored evolutionary pattern. Our study confirm the importance of continuing genomic surveillance, even outside usual pathways, for anticipating viral behavior, informing public health interventions, and strengthening preparedness for future outbreaks.\n\n### Limitations\n\nGiven the widespread diffusion of lineage B of clade IIb outside endemic areas, there is a disproportionate availability of genomes of B sub-lineages (> 11.000 genomes uploaded on GISAID consulted on 14th March 2025) and a limited amount of A lineage variants (828 genomes uploaded on GISAID consulted on 14th March 2025) making it difficult to perform comprehensive evolutionary studies and formulate hypotheses.\n\nThis study further shows a significant bias in MPXV genomic surveillance, given the data available from the African continent mainly referred to Nigerian isolates that may have limited our understanding of the virus evolutionary dynamics in less explored endemic areas.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Diagnosis, genome sequencing, and assembly\n\nMethods of diagnostic confirmation for the 11 cases were reported previously[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR18 \"Gaspari, V. et al. Monkeypox outbreak 2022: clinical and virological features of 30 patients at the sexually transmitted diseases centre of sant’ Orsola hospital, bologna, Northeastern Italy. J Clin. Microbiol 61, (2023).\")employing two real-time PCR assays: one targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA for viral detection, and a second assay for clade-specific identification[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR13 \"Li, Y., Zhao, H., Wilkins, K., Hughes, C. & Damon, I. K. Real-time PCR assays for the specific detection of Monkeypox virus West African and congo basin strain DNA. J. Virol. Methods. 169, 223–227 (2010).\"). Written consents for the publication of the scientific results were obtained from all patients. For this study, genomic data were generated for 11 MPXV isolates (Table [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#Tab1)) on Vero cells E6 (CRL-1586, ATCC). After 4 blind passages, viral genomic DNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant after three freeze thaw cycles using QIAamp UltraSens Virus Kit (Qiagen) and viral load was confirmed by real-time PCR[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR38 \"Cheng, W. et al. Development of a SYBR green I real-time PCR for detection and quantitation of orthopoxvirus by using Ectromelia virus. Mol. Cell. Probes. 38, 45–50 (2018).\"). Libraries were prepared using the Native Barcoding Kit 24 V14 (SQK-NBD114.24; Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Normalized and pooled libraries were loaded on R10.4.1 flow cells and run for 72 h on MiniION according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\n​Following data acquisition, quality control and adapter trimming were performed on the raw reads. The filtered, high-quality reads for each sample underwent de novo assembly using Flye v.2.9.5 [39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR39 \"Kolmogorov, M., Yuan, J., Lin, Y. & Pevzner, P. A. Assembly of long, error-prone reads using repeat graphs. Nat. Biotechnol. 37, 540–546 (2019).\"). Subsequently, reference-based scaffolding was performed using MPXV-M5312\\_HM12\\_Rivers (GenBank Accession Number: NC\\_063383.1) as the reference genome on Lasergene® 17.0 Software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA) for precise alignment and assembly refinement. Finally, the quality of the assembled genomes was assessed using QUAST v.5.3.0 [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR40 \"Gurevich, A., Saveliev, V., Vyahhi, N. & Tesler, G. QUAST: quality assessment tool for genome assemblies. Bioinformatics 29, 1072–1075 (2013).\") .\n\n### Additional genomes\n\nWe retrieved the whole-genome sequences labelled as “Complete” from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Virus database ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/)) as of October 4, 2024. Clade IIb MPXV sequences were subsampled using appropriate filtering criteria. Within clade IIb, representative samples were randomly selected for each lineage.\n\nQuality control and metadata retrieval for the final dataset were conducted using NextClade[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR41 \"Aksamentov, I., Roemer, C., Hodcroft, E. & Neher, R. Nextclade: clade assignment, mutation calling and quality control for viral genomes. J. Open. Source Softw. 6, 3773 (2021).\") ( [https://clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org/)), resulting in a curated dataset of 267 high-quality clade II MPXV genomes. A complete list of genomes analysed in this study is provided in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n### Phylogenetic and molecular evolution analysis\n\nThe evolutionary trajectory and genomic features of the 11 MPXV samples sequenced were studied by aligning them with all sequences listed in Supplementary Table 1. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was conducted with MAFFT v7.525 [42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR42 \"Katoh, K. & Standley, D. M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability. Mol. Biol. Evol. 30, 772–780 (2013).\") using the –auto option, and the resulting alignment was visualized in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software v11.0.13 [43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR43 \"Tamura, K., Stecher, G. & Kumar, S. MEGA11: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 11. Mol. Biol. Evol. 38, 3022–3027 (2021).\"). To improve accuracy, the alignment was refined with trimAl v1.5 [44](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR44 \"Capella-Gutiérrez, S., Silla-Martínez, J. M. & Gabaldón, T. TrimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses. Bioinformatics 25, 1972–1973 (2009).\"), applying the gappyout option to exclude non-conserved 5’-3’ UTR (UnTraslated Regions). A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was then constructed with IQ-TREE v2.3.6 [45](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR45 \"Nguyen, L. T., Schmidt, H. A., von Haeseler, A. & Minh, B. Q. IQ-TREE: A fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating Maximum-Likelihood phylogenies. Mol. Biol. Evol. 32, 268–274 (2015).\")which automatically selected the best nucleotide substitution model and performed 10,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates. Finally, the phylogenetic tree was visualized using iTOL v.7.0 [46](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR46 \"Ciccarelli, F. D. et al. Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life. Sci. (1979). 311, 1283–1287 (2006).\").\n\n### Mutations in putative APOBEC3 motifs and analysis of key protein variations\n\nFor the variant analysis, a subset of 120 sequences from lineage and sub-lineage A, as listed in Supplementary Table 1, was selected. To characterize APOBEC-style mutations, we used the MPXV reference genome **NC\\_063383**, classified as an NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq), since lineage A represents the most recent common ancestor of all MPXV sub-lineage A. Mutations were further annotated using Snipit v1.6 [47](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR47 \"O’Toole, Á., Aziz, A. & Maloney, D. Publication-ready single nucleotide polymorphism visualization with snipit. Bioinformatics 40, (2024).\").\n\nIn this study, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification and analysis of mutations attributed to the activity of the APOBEC3 enzyme family has been developed. Starting from multiple genome alignments against a reference sequence, the pipeline performed SNP calling and selectively filters APOBEC-style mutations (T **C →** T **T**, **G** G **→ A** G, **G** A **→ A** A), which represent key mutagenic events mediated by APOBEC activity.\n\nThe pipeline was implemented in Python, and the results were visualized using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. Statistical analysis of nucleotide frequencies was performed on each lineage independently. Frequencies were calculated from the results of the variant calling pipeline, as described in Results section. We studied the frequency of each detected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in that cohort, and for all samples we described the total amount of SNPs as well as APOBEC-predicted mutations.\n\nFurthermore, targeted analyses were conducted on specific genomic regions to investigate mutations in the MPXV DNA Replication Complex (RC), assess potential gene disruptions caused by nucleotide substitutions and identify associated amino acid alterations.\n\n### Protein sequence alignment\n\nProtein structure and function were subsequently investigated to study the implications of nucleotide modifications. The reference database for protein search is UniProt[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR17 \"Bateman, A. et al. UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2025. Nucleic Acids Res. 53, D609–D617 (2025).\") ( [https://www.uniprot.org/](https://www.uniprot.org/)). Database search is performed with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR48 \"Camacho, C. et al. BLAST+: architecture and applications. BMC Bioinformatics 10, (2009).\")as installed at UniProt and sequence alignment is computed with the Align Tool, which aligns protein sequences using the Clustal Omega program ( [http://www.clustal.org/omega/](http://www.clustal.org/omega/)). Gene designations were given using the Vaccinia virus Copenhagen nomenclature[49](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR49 \"Goebel, S. J. et al. The complete DNA sequence of vaccinia virus. Virology 179, 247–266 (1990).\").\n\n### Protein structural modeling\n\nFor sequence structural modeling, we adopted the AlFaFold 3 web server[50](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR50 \"Abramson, J. et al. Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with alphafold 3. Nature 630, 493–500 (2024).\") (developed by Google DeepMind). AlphaFold produces a per-atom model confidence score (the predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT), scaled from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher confidence and a more accurate prediction. The server has a sequence length limitation (400 residues). For proteins with a higher sequence length, we adopted models computed by the default method used by the SWISS-MODEL homology modelling pipeline and Structure Assessment - a single model method combining statistical potentials and agreement terms with a distance constraints (DisCo) score. DisCo evaluates consistencies of pairwise CA-CA distances from a model with constraints extracted from homologous structures[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR17 \"Bateman, A. et al. UniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase in 2025. Nucleic Acids Res. 53, D609–D617 (2025).\"), [51](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR51 \"Studer, G. et al. QMEANDisCo—distance constraints applied on model quality Estimation. Bioinformatics 36, 1765–1771 (2020).\"), [52](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR52 \"Waterhouse, A. M. et al. The structure assessment web server: for proteins, complexes and more. Nucleic Acids Res. 52, W318–W323 (2024).\") ( [https://swissmodel.expasy.org/](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/)).\n\nPairwise structural alignment of models was computed with TM-align installed at the PDB database[53](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-11855-5#ref-CR53 \"Bittrich, S., Segura, J., Duarte, J. M., Burley, S. K. & Rose, Y. RCSB protein data bank: exploring protein 3D similarities via comprehensive structural alignments. Bioinformatics 40, (2024).\") ( [https://www.rcsb.org/alignment](https://www.rcsb.org/alignment)) and model superimposition was visualized with Mol\\* (/‘molstar/), a modern web-based open-source toolkit for visualization and analysis of molecular data ( [https://molstar.org/](https://molstar.org/)). Figures are done with PyMOL (Schrodinger, LLC. 2010.

Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the causative agent of mpox, has been maintained in animal reservoirs in the forested regions of West and Central Africa as 2 distinct clades; clade I has historically caused more severe infection in Central Africa than clade II, historically found in West Africa. However, rapid reemergence and spread of both MPXV clades through novel routes of transmission have challenged the known characteristics of mpox. We summarize mpox demographic distribution, clinical severity, and case-fatality rates attributed to genetically distinct MPXV subclades and focus on MPXV clade Ib, the more recently identified subclade. Broad worldwide assistance will be necessary to halt the spread of both MPXV clades within mpox endemic and nonendemic regions to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nMonkeypox virus (MPXV), the causative agent of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), has reemerged as a major public health concern across the globe because of recent outbreaks. Accordingly, the World Health Organization declared public health emergencies of international concern, initially for the global mpox outbreak on July 22, 2022, and again on August 14, 2024, for ongoing mpox outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and nearby countries ( [_1_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r21 \"1\"), [_2_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r22 \"2\")). MPXV has circulated in endemic regions since the 1970s, primarily because of zoonotic spillover followed by limited household transmission ( [_3_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r23 \"3\")). However, more efficient spread in humans via sexual contact led to ≈100,000 mpox cases during May 2022–August 2024, including in 115 previously nonendemic countries ( [_4_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r24 \"4\")).\n\nAfter eradication of smallpox (caused by variola virus) in 1980, MPXV has become the major orthopoxvirus infecting humans. The increased incidence of mpox has likely been caused by several factors, such as an increase in the proportion of immunologically naive populations after discontinuing routine smallpox vaccination and waning immunity in those persons previously vaccinated. Increased surveillance and diagnostic testing have also led to the detection of mpox in various countries after several decades with no reported cases ( [_5_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r25 \"5\"), [_6_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r26 \"6\")).\n\nMPXV is classified into 2 distinct clades and further into subclades on the basis of genetic differences ( [_7_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r27 \"7\")). Historically, mpox cases caused by clade I and clade II MPXV were segregated to countries in central (clade I) and western (clade II) Africa, presumably because of geographic barriers separating the reservoir host(s) populations ( [Figure 1](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/F21)) ( [_8_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r28 \"8\")). Clade I and II MPXV genomes differ by ≈0.4%–0.5% in nonrepetitive regions conserved between the clades and by the presence of 4 large insertion/deletions ( [_7_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r27 \"7\")); the clades are estimated to have evolved separately over hundreds of years.\n\n### Clade II MPXV\n\nClade II MPXV (previously known as West African MPXV) was first identified in the 1970s. According to sequence data, clade II MPXV is divided into subclades IIa and IIb. Before 2022, mpox cases caused by clades IIa and IIb were separated by the Dahomey Gap in West Africa ( [_9_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r29 \"9\")), which might have been a geographic barrier for unknown MPXV reservoir hosts that enabled those 2 subclades to evolve separately ( [_8_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r28 \"8\"), [_9_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r29 \"9\")). Clades IIa and IIb share ≈99.8% nucleotide identity in conserved nonrepetitive regions and can be differentiated by a large subclade-specific insertion/deletion. In 2017, Nigeria reported an mpox outbreak caused by MPXV clade IIb after decades of no reported cases ( [_10_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r210 \"10\")). In 2022, clade IIb spread globally to many countries that had previously not reported mpox cases. Global mpox cases caused by clade IIb MPXV peaked for most countries during July–October 2022 ( [_11_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r211 \"11\")), but the outbreak has been ongoing since then; low numbers of cases have been reported in many countries previously unaffected by mpox.\n\nSince the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria, extensive human-to-human transmission of clade IIb MPXV has disproportionately impacted men who have sex with men through sexual activity ( [_10_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r210 \"10\"), [_12_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r212 \"12\"), [_13_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r213 \"13\")), conflicting with the general understanding of mpox cases in endemic countries as being caused by zoonotic spillover followed by limited person-to-person spread. Moreover, starting with MPXV sequences from Nigeria in 2017 through the 2022 global outbreak, it became clear that clade IIb MPXV was accumulating mutations at a faster rate than previously reported for orthopoxviruses ( [_12_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r212 \"12\")– [_14_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r214 \"14\")). Most single-nucleotide polymorphisms were GA to AA mutations, linked to the activity of host innate immunity proteins belonging to the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) 3 family ( [_12_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r212 \"12\")– [_14_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r214 \"14\")). APOBEC3 family members exhibit diverse functions, including cytidine deamidation leading to signature G-to-A point mutations. The human genome encodes 6 functional APOBEC3 proteins, including APOBEC3F, which has been shown to produce extensive G-to-A mutations in the MPXV genome in cultured cells ( [_15_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r215 \"15\")). APOBEC3 signature mutations are not observed in MPXV lineages having documented zoonotic transmission but are limited to those lineages involved in human-to-human transmission (i.e., clades Ia and IIa) ( [_12_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r212 \"12\"), [_13_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r213 \"13\")); accumulations of APOBEC3-mediated signature mutations in MPXV lineages are now considered an indicator of sustained human-to-human transmission. It is not clear how those host-induced mutations are affecting MPXV; however, no evidence exists suggesting they cause increased virulence. The mutations have been reported across the genome in both coding and noncoding regions. In animal models, clade IIb viruses have been associated with decreased virulence compared with clades Ia and IIa ( [_16_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r216 \"16\")), but genetic differences between those clades are not limited to APOBEC3-mediated mutations.\n\n[Top](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#)\n\n### Clade I MPXV\n\nWhereas clade IIb MPXV spread globally in 2022 and 2023, mpox cases caused by clade I MPXV were reported only in known mpox endemic countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Republic of Congo, Gabon, Cameroon, and Central African Republic. None of the clade I–endemic countries reported cases caused by clade IIb MPXV during the 2022 global clade II outbreak except for Cameroon (only country in which clades I and II were both endemic before 2022), although virus characterization and testing were limited. Since 2022, the number of suspected clade I–associated mpox cases and deaths in DRC has increased considerably, and the highest number of suspected mpox cases in DRC was recorded in 2024 ( [_17_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r217 \"17\")). Epidemiologic and genetic investigations of mpox in DRC during 2023–2024 revealed multiple outbreaks occurred involving different transmission dynamics, geographic distribution, and affected populations.\n\nAlthough mpox is endemic to DRC, in 2023 and 2024, mpox cases were being reported in previously disease-free areas in persons >15 years of age, whereas in other provinces those <15 years of age were most affected. Historically, children have been the most vulnerable to and affected by clade I–associated mpox in DRC; >80% of suspected cases and the highest case-fatality rates (CFRs) have been recorded in children <15 years of age ( [_3_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r23 \"3\")). The historically high incidence of mpox in children was predominantly thought to be mediated by zoonotic spillover or occasional household transmissions ( [_18_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r218 \"18\")).\n\nIn late 2023, South Kivu, a province with few mpox cases, reported an mpox outbreak that had sexual contact as a primary factor for virus transmission ( [_19_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r219 \"19\")). The MPXV causing cases in South Kivu was genetically distinct from clade I MPXV sequences from other regions of DRC ( [_19_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r219 \"19\"), [_20_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r220 \"20\")), indicating that 2 distinct subclades were causing outbreaks in that country; the subclades have officially been designated Ia (which includes historical clade I MPXV sequences) and Ib ( [Figure 2](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/F22), panels A, B) ( [_19_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r219 \"19\"), [_20_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r220 \"20\")). Since late 2023, clade Ib MPXV has spread beyond South Kivu into other provinces of DRC and internationally to countries that had not previously reported mpox ( [Figure 3](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/F23)). The mpox outbreak caused by clade IIb continues to be associated with person-to-person transmission through both sexual and nonsexual close contact.\n\nAlthough clade Ib MPXV has been recently discovered and named, similar MPXV sequences were collected during 2011–2012 in North and South Kivu ( [_21_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r221 \"21\")), suggesting a clade Ib ancestor of the virus causing the 2023–2024 outbreak might have been present in the same region years earlier ( [_21_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r221 \"21\")). Clade Ib MPXV sequences from the 2023–2024 outbreak are characterized by low overall genetic diversity, the accumulation of APOBEC3-mediated signature mutations, and a large 1,142-bp genomic deletion relative to clade Ia ( [_19_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r219 \"19\")), resulting in loss of the complement control protein (CCP) gene. Although low genetic diversity within the clade Ib outbreak lineage is indicative of a recent outbreak, the abundance of APOBEC3-induced mutations is an indicator of sustained human-to-human transmission. However, transmission and demographic data for clade Ib suggests that increased sexual transmission, including through female sex trade workers, was predominantly driving the initial outbreak and subsequent sustained transmission ( [_22_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r222 \"22\")). Clade Ia MPXV sequences from across DRC had much higher overall genetic diversity (≈10-fold higher than clade Ib) and a lower proportion of APOBEC3-induced signature mutations, suggesting that, unlike the clade Ib outbreak lineage, sustained human-to-human spread of clade Ia has not been pervasive throughout DRC, according to sequence data from 2018 through early 2024. Epidemiologic and genetic data for clade Ia MPXV still largely support the modality of zoonotic spillover followed by occasional human-to-human transmission or small outbreaks, but how the virus is repeatedly introduced into the human population is poorly understood.\n\nOne exception to the association between MPXV clade subtypes and zoonotic (clade Ia) or human-to-human (clade Ib) transmission has been reported in Kinshasa, DRC, where mpox outbreaks caused by both clade Ia and Ib MPXV are ongoing ( [_23_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r223 \"23\"); T. Wawina-Bokalanga et al., unpub. data, [https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.15.24317404External Link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.15.24317404)). MPXV sequences from the Kinshasa outbreaks have accumulated APOBEC3-induced mutations (T. Wawina-Bokalanga et al., unpub. data), regardless of the clade subtype, reinforcing the notion that accumulation of APOBEC3-induced mutations is a molecular indicator of sustained human-to-human transmission. Since 2022, many investigations have focused on genetic changes that might have occurred in clade IIb MPXV that led to a global outbreak. Current evidence has not identified any subclade-specific virus adaptations that can explain why clade Ia, Ib, and IIb lineages have led to large outbreaks, suggesting that environmental factors (i.e., the network of persons into which the virus is introduced) play a critical role. Clade Ia, Ib, and IIb lineages have each caused outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission; thus, it is clear that any MPXV clade or subclade has the potential to cause such outbreaks, if (or when) the virus is introduced into a permissive transmission network that supports sustained transmission ( [_23_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r223 \"23\"); T. Wawina-Bokalanga et al., unpub. data). Continued genomic sequence surveillance is critical to monitor ongoing mpox outbreaks in DRC and beyond.\n\n[Top](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#)\n\n### Comparisons of MPXV Clade Pathogenesis and Spread\n\nClinical studies of mpox in humans, as well as animal studies, have reported higher fatality rates for clade I than clade II infections; a higher number of persons with severe disease and more nonsexual human-to-human spread have also been reported for clade I MPXV (before the current outbreaks) compared with clade II infections ( [_7_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r27 \"7\"), [_16_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r216 \"16\"), [_24_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r224 \"24\"), [_25_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r225 \"25\")). However, the pathogenesis, CFRs, and standards of treatment for mpox have varied for clades I and II. From a review of historic literature published before 2020, CFRs were estimated to be 10.6% for clade Ia and 3.6% for clade II MPXV infections without any medical intervention, and those estimates were likely influenced by limited or biased testing ( [_26_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r226 \"26\")). Even in 2023, the CFR for clade I–associated suspected and confirmed mpox cases in DRC was estimated at 4.5% ( [_27_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r227 \"27\")). However, general medical interventions have been shown to decrease CFR for MPXV clade I–associated cases. For instance, a 1.38% CFR was observed in the town of Kole during a natural history observational clinical study that included standard medical care ( [_28_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r228 \"28\")), and a 1.7% CFR was observed with similar care during a clinical trial testing tecovirimat (both presumably clade Ia studies) ( [_29_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r229 \"29\")). The mpox CFRs in South Kivu (which has only reported clade Ib MPXV infections) have consistently stayed <1% for suspected cases ( [_27_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r227 \"27\"), [_30_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r230 \"30\"), [_31_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r231 \"31\")), lower than for clade Ia infections elsewhere in DRC. In addition, Burundi, which has had a clade Ib–associated mpox outbreak because of cross-border spread from DRC, had 1,607 confirmed mpox cases but only 1 fatality reported during July 22–October 31, 2024; moreover, in 1 Burundi study, ≈50% of mpox infections were in children, with no reported deaths ( [_31_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r231 \"31\")– [_33_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r233 \"33\")). Taken together, those preliminary data suggest a lower CFR for clade Ib than for clade Ia, but additional studies are needed to confirm that difference.\n\nCFR estimates can be affected by differences in populations, demographics, and underlying health conditions (including food insecurity); access to healthcare; and testing biases. For example, the CFR (≈0.2% globally) for mpox caused by the clade IIb global outbreak lineage was considerably less than historical estimates for clade II, according to data from parts of the world with access to strong medical care systems. CFRs and clinical details from Kinshasa and other areas of DRC where clade Ia and Ib are co-circulating in comparable populations will provide a more reliable comparison of disease severity caused by those subclades ( [_4_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r24 \"4\")).\n\nComparisons of MPXV genomic sequences revealed loss of the CCP gene (also known as monkeypox inhibitor of complement enzymes, encoded by _D14L_, a homologue of smallpox inhibitor of complement enzymes of vaccinia virus Copenhagen, encoded by _C4L_) in clades II and Ib compared with clade Ia. Researchers have hypothesized that deletion of the CCP gene might be the reason for decreased CFRs and disease severity historically reported for mpox caused by clades II and Ib compared with clade Ia viruses. However, animal studies investigating the effect of CCP gene loss have produced conflicting results. In 1 study, targeted deletion of the CCP gene from clade Ia MPXV (isolate ROC-2003-358) caused significantly decreased illness and death in infected prairie dogs, whereas addition of that gene to clade IIa MPXV caused slight changes in disease manifestation but had no apparent effect on disease-associated death ( [_34_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r234 \"34\")). In another study, replacing large regions of the terminal genome of clade Ia with a corresponding sequence from clade IIa did not produce a difference in animal survival ( [_35_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r235 \"35\")). A third study in nonhuman primates found differences in adaptive immune responses when the CCP gene was deleted from clade Ia MPXV (isolate Zaire-1979 005) ( [_36_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r236 \"36\")). Investigators of all 3 studies concluded that the CCP deletion was not solely responsible for the differential pathogenicity between the clades ( [_34_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r234 \"34\")– [_36_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r236 \"36\")). Additional animal studies with clade Ib isolates will help elucidate whether the genetic changes observed (CCP deletion and other mutations) do indeed result in a less virulent virus compared with clade Ia isolates. Other mutations (induced by APOBEC3 and non-APOBEC3 proteins) that distinguish clades Ia and Ib might also contribute to lower CFRs currently observed for clade Ib in South Kivu and Burundi compared with those of clade Ia cases elsewhere in DRC.\n\nEven if clade Ib is confirmed to be less virulent than clade Ia, recent reports highlight the threat of that virus subclade, which appears to spread efficiently via sexual contact and within some household settings. Spread of clade Ib has occurred beyond South Kivu into neighboring and nonneighboring provinces of DRC, including the capital city Kinshasa, as well as internationally to multiple surrounding countries; >30 travel-associated cases have been reported outside of Africa. Because of privacy concerns, the country (or countries) to which patients had traveled was not released for most of those cases. However, only ≈17% had traveled to DRC; the remaining patients (≈80%) for which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had received travel information had traveled to other countries in Africa that had sustained clade Ib outbreaks or to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Eight mpox cases caused by clade Ib from 5 different countries (China, India, Oman, Pakistan, and Thailand) have been reported in persons who traveled to UAE. Sequences from 6 cases linked to UAE travel form a monophyletic cluster ( [Figure 2](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/F22), panel B), suggesting a common ancestor. Considering the common travel history, the simplest explanation for clustering of those cases is exposure of the travelers to MPXV in UAE. Data suggest the presence of a similar strain of MPXV in Uganda and UAE around September/October 2024. Infections with the same strain in travelers to UAE during January–March 2025 warrant investigation into the possibility of sustained person-to-person transmission in UAE. Travelers should be aware of the exposure risks for clade Ib mpox in countries with ongoing clade I transmission ( [_37_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r237 \"37\")).\n\n[Top](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#)\n\n### Mpox Diagnostics and Treatment\n\nThe genomic deletion characteristic of recent clade Ib sequences prevents detection by commonly used PCR developed for clade I ( [_38_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r238 \"38\")). When performing clade-specific PCR that targets nonessential genes, laboratories should also use PCR targeting other genomic regions, including essential genes, such as the DNA polymerase gene (target of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nonvariola orthopoxvirus test) ( [_39_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r239 \"39\"), [_40_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r240 \"40\")), to ensure mpox cases caused by clade Ib are not missed. In the United States, the recommended approach is to first (or concurrently) test by using a nonvariola orthopoxvirus or generic MPXV PCR targeting a conserved region. Then, after orthopoxvirus or MPXV is confirmed, additional clade-specific PCR or sequencing can be used (if needed) to determine the clade.\n\nIrrespective of the differences in clades, the current smallpox and mpox vaccines are expected to be effective in controlling the spread and severity of disease because orthopoxviruses (e.g., MPXV \\[clades Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb\\], vaccinia virus, variola virus) are >90% genetically related. Genetic relatedness was the premise and success behind smallpox eradication, which used vaccinia virus vaccine to cross-protect against smallpox. Live, replicating smallpox vaccines (e.g., ACAM2000; Emergent Bioservices, [https://emergentbio.comExternal Link](https://emergentbio.com/)) are contraindicated for immunocompromised persons and those with certain skin conditions. Hence, nonreplicating modified vaccinia Ankara vaccines, MVA-BN (Bavarian Nordic, [https://www.bavarian-nordic.comExternal Link](https://www.bavarian-nordic.com/)) and JYNNEOS ( [https://jynneos.comExternal Link](https://jynneos.com/)), have been widely used in the United States and have been approved for use in adults >18 years of age. More than 1.2 million vaccine doses have been administered in the United States, and only very few vaccine breakthrough cases have been reported for most vaccinated persons after >2 years since completion of both doses ( [_41_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r241 \"41\")). Those breakthrough case-patients also tended to exhibit milder disease course with no hospitalizations compared with unvaccinated patients ( [_42_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r242 \"42\")). Multiple studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness for MVA-BN demonstrated >66%–86% protection against mpox (clade IIb); 2-dose vaccinations provided higher levels of protection than a single dose ( [_43_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r243 \"43\")– [_45_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r245 \"45\")). To control clade I–associated mpox, several countries (DRC, Rwanda, Central African Republic, and Uganda) experiencing that outbreak have extended temporary or emergency use authorization of MVA-BN in adults, and vaccination of high-risk populations is ongoing. The European Medicines Agency approved MVA-BN for adolescents 12–17 years of age in late 2024, and the World Health Organization recently prequalified the vaccine for that same age group. In addition to MVA-BN, another smallpox vaccine, LC-16 (attenuated strain of vaccinia virus strain Lister; KM Biologics, [https://www.kmbiologics.comExternal Link](https://www.kmbiologics.com/)), received emergency authorization in DRC. Unlike MVA-BN, LC-16 is a minimally replicating vaccine requiring 1 dose and approved for use in persons >1 year of age.\n\nFor many mpox patients in the United States, the smallpox antiviral drug tecovirimat (inhibits extracellular virus formation) has been administered as the primary therapeutic intervention through an expanded access investigational new drug protocol. For severe mpox cases or those patients at risk for severe disease (e.g., immunocompromised persons), combination therapy with tecovirimat and other antiviral drugs approved for smallpox treatment, such as cidofovir, brincidofovir (inhibits DNA replication), and vaccinia immune globulin, has been sometimes recommended on the basis of clinical needs of the patient ( [_46_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r246 \"46\")). Prolonged treatment with tecovirimat has led to the development of resistant viruses; limited spread of resistant viruses among persons with no previous treatment has been observed, indicating the importance of containment and surveillance to detect those viruses ( [_47_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r247 \"47\"), [_48_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r248 \"48\")). A randomized controlled study to determine the effectiveness of tecovirimat against clade I mpox in DRC reported no improvement in mpox resolution ( [_30_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r230 \"30\"), [_49_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r249 \"49\")). A study on tecovirimat efficacy against clade IIb MPXV infections in the United States reported similar results ( [_50_](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#r250 \"50\")). Additional studies assessing alternative drugs, earlier treatment with tecovirimat (i.e., before lesion onset), tecovirimat efficacy in immunocompromised persons, and combination treatment with other interventions are still needed. Because of the spread of mpox to many countries that historically did not see cases, including ongoing cases of clade IIb—associated mpox 2 years after the start of the outbreak, effective therapeutic agents for mpox are urgently needed.\n\n[Top](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMpox is an old disease but is now reemerging and causing international concern because of decreasing population immunity and sustained human-to-human transmission mediated through global travel, increased animal–human interfaces, and expansive sexual networks, leading to spread from small geographic regions and establishment of the disease in various parts of the world. Renewed global attention to mpox has occurred yet again because of the surge in reported mpox cases caused by clade I MPXV in DRC and the spread of the newly recognized clade Ib virus. Although clade Ib is in the spotlight, the remote forested regions of DRC where zoonotic clade Ia MPXV continues to circulate should not be forgotten. Broad worldwide assistance is necessary to halt the spread of both clade Ia and Ib within Africa to prevent future outbreaks.\n\n[Top](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/8/24-1551_article#)\n\nTopExternal Link\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank all of the past and present members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clade I mpox response team, particularly Satish Pillai and Ermias Belay for their response leadership; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Poxvirus and Rabies Branch (Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases); and domestic and internal partners for their dedicated work in this ongoing outbreak, including Namanya Dianah, Kaleebu Pontiano, and Lutwama Julius from Uganda Virus Research Institute; and the countries that have had clade Ib imported cases and have shared the travel, clinical, and epidemiologic information for those cases to inform our understanding of this newly recognized subclade.

This outbreak, spanning 2022–2023, was primarily driven by the clade IIb strain. Subsequently, a surge of MPXV cases caused by clades Ia and Ib in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other African countries has garnered heightened attention. Notably, clade Ib has recently been imported into China. In this study, we report the first identification and genetic characterization of a novel imported MPXV strain in China, from a patient returning from an endemic area. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed its close relationship to MPXV clade Ia, which has not been previously reported in China. The strain was successfully isolated using Vero-E6 cell inoculation. Compared with the reference MPXV clade I strain, the imported Ia strain exhibited substantial genomic divergence, with 67 mutations identified. Among them, 28 non-synonymous mutations were found in genes associated with host interaction and viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the critical role of genomic surveillance and rapid molecular diagnostics in monitoring MPXV transmission and evolution. The successful isolation of a clade Ia strain provides a valuable resource for future research on its pathogenicity and for the development of targeted therapeutics.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMonkeypox virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic virus belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus and is the causative agent of mpox in humans. It is endemic to regions of West and Central Africa, with the first human case reported in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ( [1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref1)). Since its discovery, cases have been predominantly reported in rural and rainforest regions of the Congo Basin in DRC, its neighboring countries, and in West Africa, with occasional exported cases reported outside Africa linked to travel or animal importation from endemic regions ( [2](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref2)). However, the 2022 global outbreak marked a significant epidemiological shift, with widespread human-to-human transmission documented in over 100 non-endemic countries, raising concerns about sustained global transmission ( [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref3)– [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref6)).\n\nMPXV is genetically classified into two major clades: clade I (Congo Basin/Central African clade) and clade II (West African clade) ( [7](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref7), [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref8)). Cameroon is the only known country where both clades co-circulate, with clade I and clade II predominating in the eastern and western regions, respectively ( [9](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref9)). Clade II is further divided into subclades IIa and IIb, the latter being responsible for the 2022 global outbreak ( [10](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref10)). Recent genomic surveillance in eastern DRC identified a genetically distinct lineage within clade I, now referred to as clade Ib ( [11](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref11)). Earlier phylogenetic studies had already recognized multiple lineages within clade I, which are now collectively termed clade Ia ( [12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref12), [13](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref13)). Both clades are capable of causing mpox in humans; however, infections with clade II are typically milder and less transmissible compared to clade I infections ( [14](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref14)). The 2022 clade IIb-driven outbreak, largely involving sexual transmission within networks of men who have sex with men, led to over 100,000 cases globally and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) ( [15](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref15)– [17](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref17)). Although global case numbers have since declined, the outbreak remains ongoing ( [18](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref18)). In contrast, the current outbreak in DRC has been linked to clade Ib, which is associated with more severe clinical presentations than clade II and has demonstrated potential for broader spread ( [11](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref11), [19](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref19)). The detection of clade Ib cases in travelers returning to non-endemic regions further underscores the risk of international dissemination ( [20](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref20)– [22](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref22)). In comparison, the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of clade Ia remain less well understood.\n\nIn this study, we report the identification and genomic characterization of an imported MPXV strain belonging to clade Ia, isolated from a returning traveler from the DRC to China. This marks the first documented importation of a clade Ia strain into China. Rapid detection and isolation of this case enabled timely public health intervention and appropriate clinical management. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted to explore the evolutionary relationships of this strain with other circulating MPXV variants. Thorough characterization of such imported strains is essential, as they may harbor unique genetic or phenotypic features with implications for public health. Furthermore, successful viral isolation provides a valuable resource for future research into MPXV pathogenesis, inter-clade differences, transmission mechanisms, and the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nThis study was approved by Ethics Committee of Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shandong CDC), and conducted in strict accordance with biosafety and ethical standards and the relevant laws and regulations of People’s Republic of China. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for epidemiological investigations, clinical sample collection, diagnostic testing, virus isolation and data publication. All personal identifiers were removed to ensure confidentiality. The study posed no additional risks to the patient, and appropriate biosafety protocols were followed during sample handling and viral isolation. Experiments with live MPXV was performed under BSL-3 conditions at Shandong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, under the standard operating procedure approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.\n\n### Sample collection and laboratory diagnosis\n\nBlood samples and skin lesion swabs with vesicular fluid from different body sites were collected for subsequent laboratory diagnosis. Viral genome of the clinical samples was extracted using a commercial nucleic acid extraction kit (Bioperfectus, SDKF60101) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The MPXV genome was subjected to monkeypox virus genotyping detection, using a triplex real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay targeting clade Ia, clade Ib, and clade II MPXV provided by China CDC. The result interpretation criteria were as follows: No Ct value was considered negative, a Ct value ≤38 was considered positive, and a Ct value between 38 and 42 required retesting for further verification.\n\n### Virus isolation and propagation\n\nVero E6 cells were used for viral isolation under BSL-3 containment. One day prior to inoculation, Vero E6 cells (1 × 106 cells per well) were seeded into 6-well plate with 2 mL of culture medium. On the day of the assay, the cells were inoculated with clinical samples and incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO₂ for 4 to 7 days. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed daily under light microscopy. Cell culture supernatants were collected at regular intervals for real-time PCR analysis. Following fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), CPE was visualized and further confirmed by crystal violet staining.\n\n### Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis\n\nViral DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Kit (Qiagen, 51,306) from clinical specimen. Subsequently, the MPXV whole genome was enriched from the extracted viral DNA using the Target Capture Kit for Mpox Virus (Baiyi Technology Co., Ltd., BK-MPXY024). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using the Illumina NextSeq2000 platform, generating paired-end reads. The complete genome was reference-based assembly using QIAGEN CLC Genomics Workbench (version23.0.3) ( [Supplementary material](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#SM1)). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using IQ-TREE (version 2.4.0) with the maximum likelihood method. The newly imported strain was compared with MPXV genomes from the GISAID database.\n\n## Results\n\n### Clinical presentation of the reported monkeypox case\n\nThe first confirmed clade I monkeypox (MPXV-Ia) case in Shandong Province was a 34-year-old unmarried male, who worked overseas, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from January, 2024 to March, 2025. The patient initially developed perineal lesions, followed by fever, scattered skin rashes, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Initial treatment with antimalarial and antibiotic therapy did not lead to significant improvement. After returning to China, the patient sought medical attention due to persistent skin lesions. Based on clinical presentation and travel history, monkeypox infection was suspected and reported to the local CDC. The patient was subsequently hospitalized in an isolation ward, where the condition remained stable. He was born after the cessation of routine smallpox vaccination programs in China and had no history of smallpox or cowpox vaccination according to his self-report and medical history.\n\n### Virus confirmation and isolation\n\nThe patient experienced fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes, followed by vesicular skin lesions. Real-time PCR confirmed MPXV infection, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 18.8 in lesion swabs and 40.4 in serum, indicating a high viral load in skin lesions ( [Supplementary Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#SM1); [Figure 1A](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig1)). The lesion swab specimen, suspended in viral transport medium, was subsequently inoculated onto pre-seeded Vero-E6 cells. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were first observed on day 2 post-inoculation and became prominent by day 3, characterized by cell rounding, detachment, and cell death ( [Figures 1B](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig1), [C](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig1)). Daily collection of cell culture supernatants was performed for real-time PCR analysis. A progressive decrease in Ct values from day 1 (Ct = 34.2) to day 3 (Ct = 26.1) indicated successful viral replication and productive infection in Vero-E6 cells ( [Figure 1D](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig1)).\n\nFigure 1\n\n[![Panel A shows two line graphs.

Identification and isolation of the imported MPXV clade Ia strain. **(A)** Development of a triplex real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of MPXV clades Ia, Ib, and II. The probe specific to clade II was labeled with Cyanine 5 (Cy5) at the 5′ end, while the probes specific to clades Ib and Ia were labeled with FAM and VIC, respectively. Clinical specimens from the patient were subjected to viral DNA extraction and subsequently analyzed using this assay. **(B)** Cytopathic effects (CPE) observed in Vero-E6 cells 3 days post-infection (dpi) with the isolated MPXV strain, visualized under light microscopy. **(C)** Plaque formation of the MPXV isolate on Vero-E6 cells, fixed and stained with crystal violet at 3 dpi. **(D)** Viral replication kinetics. Supernatants were collected at1, 2, and 3 dpi for DNA extraction and viral load quantification by real-time PCR. The average Ct values of the samples at 1, 2, 3 dpi were 34.2, 31.3, and 26.1.\n\n### Genomic features and phylogenetic relationships\n\nThe complete genome of the imported MPXV strain post NGS analysis was 196,956 bp in length, with a GC content of 33% (details in [Supplementary material](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#SM1)). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus sequence was closely related to MPVX clade Ia sequences ( [Figure 2A](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig2)). Evolutionary analysis based on partial Ia sequences from the GISAID database revealed that all genomes were divided into five clusters (I-V), with the genome of this case belonging to Cluster IV ( [Figure 2B](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig2)). Further analysis indicated that this genome shares high similarity with a sequence (EPI\\_ISL\\_19345014) submitted from the Republic of the Congo ( [Figure 2C](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig2)). The genome of the Chinese strain shares a recent common ancestor with the Irish strain (EPI\\_ISL\\_19742488) within the Congo Basin clade Ia lineage, with a bootstrap support of 51, although it falls within the same broader cluster as strains from Congo Brazzaville.\n\nFigure 2\n\n[![Phylogenetic trees show clades and clusters of monkeypox virus sequences.

The red-labeled text denotes the genome sequence identified in this study.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are recognized as key drivers of rapid evolution and adaptive changes in poxviruses ( [23](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref23)). Comparative genomic analysis with the clade I reference sequence (GenBank Accession No. DQ011155.1) identified 67 SNPs in the imported strain, including 28 missense mutations, 21 synonymous mutations, and the remainder located in non-coding regions of the genome ( [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#tab1); [Figure 3A](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig3)). To further explore the underlying mechanisms of MPXV evolution, we analyzed the frequency of all 12 possible nucleotide substitution types across clade Ia genomes. The results revealed that C > T and G > A transitions were the most prevalent ( [Figure 3B](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig3)), aligning with the known APOBEC3-mediated mutagenesis pathway previously implicated in MPXV evolution ( [6](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref6)). Among the 28 non-synonymous mutations, 13 were located in genes encoding viral structural or functional proteins, 10 were associated with host interaction or immune modulation, 3 were involved in viral replication, and 2 had no clearly defined function ( [Figure 3C](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#fig3)).\n\nTable 1\n\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1618022/fpubh-13-1618022-HTML-r1/image_m/fpubh-13-1618022-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1618022/fpubh-13-1618022-HTML-r1/image_m/fpubh-13-1618022-t001.jpg)\n\n**Table 1**.

The detection of this case in a traveler returning from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) underscores the continuing risk of cross-border transmission of MPXV from endemic regions, particularly in light of the recent emergence and global spread of multiple clades. While the global mpox outbreak from 2022 to 2023 was largely attributed to clade IIb, the identification of clade Ia in this study provides important insights into the diversity of circulating MPXV lineages and their potential to cause disease beyond Africa.\n\nThe imported case described here illustrates the capacity of clade I strains to present with classical mpox symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, and vesicular lesions. Although clade IIb has dominated the recent epidemiological landscape due to its efficient human-to-human transmission, clade I lineages, including both Ia and the recently defined Ib have long been associated with more severe clinical outcomes and higher mortality rates. Thus, the importation of a clade Ia strain into China is of significant concern, warranting heightened surveillance and preparedness, especially in regions with travel ties to endemic areas.\n\nRegarding the potential transmission of the virus in the DRC, although the perineal distribution of lesions suggests the possibility of sexual transmission, the patient did not self-identify as a man who has sex with men (MSM) and denied any contact with commercial sex workers. However, due to the limitations of self-reported data and the retrospective nature of the investigation, the possibility of underreported sexual exposure cannot be ruled out. Additionally, the patient noted that several local colleagues in the DRC had taken sick leave due to febrile illnesses during the same period, raising the possibility of non-sexual transmission routes such as close physical contact or fomite-mediated exposure.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis confirmed that the isolated strain belongs to clade Ia and is closely related to MPXV strains circulating in Congo-Brazzaville. However, the patient confirmed travel only within Kinshasa and surrounding regions in the DRC and explicitly denied visiting Congo-Brazzaville. Given the frequent cross-border population flow across the Congo River, it remains possible that the imported strain may reflect regional transmission dynamics involving viruses circulating in both countries. Comparative genomic analysis revealed 67 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the clade I reference genome (GenBank Accession No. DQ011155.1), including 23 non-synonymous mutations. These mutations occurred in genes involved in host interaction and viral production, such as ankyrin repeat (ANK) proteins, viral structural proteins and replication associated proteins, suggesting potential adaptive evolution that could influence viral fitness and pathogenicity. Notably, just five of these mutations were APOBEC3-like substitutions (TC > TT and GA > AA), consistent with the editing pattern previously observed for the Cla I mpox viruses from 2018 to 2022 ( [17](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref17), [24](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref24)). The relatively low numbers of APOBEC3 mutations in clade Ia suggest its multiple zoonotic introductions.\n\nSince the 2022 global outbreak, the clade IIb lineage B.1 has remained the dominant MPXV lineage in China ( [25](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref25)– [28](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref28)). Until the end of 2024, all identified cases belonged to this clade, reflecting patterns of global transmission. However, the first case of MPXV clade Ib was reported as an imported case from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in late 2024, marking the first documented introduction of this lineage into China ( [21](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1618022/full#ref21)). Globally, clade Ia remains relatively under-characterized, with limited genomic and phenotypic data available. This study contributes valuable new insights into clade Ia’s evolutionary dynamics, genetic diversity, and potential public health implications, enhancing our understanding of its role in the broader context of MPXV evolution and transmission.\n\nImportantly, the successful isolation of the virus in Vero-E6 cells and observation of cytopathic effects (CPE) post-inoculation highlights its efficient replication capacity _in vitro_. This provides an indispensable resource for downstream research, including pathogenesis studies, antiviral drug screening, and vaccine development. Given the genetic divergence and observed mutations, functional studies will be critical to assess whether the clade Ia strain exhibits altered host range, transmission potential, or virulence compared to other clades. This case also highlights the critical importance of rapid molecular diagnostics and genomic surveillance in outbreak response and containment. The triplex qPCR assay targeting different MPXV clades enabled swift identification of the viral lineage, facilitating appropriate public health interventions and clinical management. As MPXV continues to evolve and spread, particularly through global travel, integration of real-time molecular typing into surveillance systems will be essential for early detection of emerging lineages.\n\nIn conclusion, the importation of a clade Ia MPXV strain into China expands the known geographical reach of this lineage and emphasizes the dynamic nature of MPXV transmission. Continued genomic surveillance, coupled with international collaboration, will be key to understanding the evolutionary trajectory and public health risks associated with all MPXV clades. Future studies should focus on characterizing the functional consequences of observed mutations and assessing the potential for clade I strains to establish sustained transmission chains in non-endemic settings.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nThe whole-genome sequence of the Mpox virus clade Ia strain reported in this article has been deposited in the GISAID database under the accession number EPI\\_ISL\\_19867420, with the virus designated as hMpxV/China/SD-SDCDC-01/2025.
