Both types spread the same way and can be prevented using the same methods.\n- There have been more than 40,000 cases of clade I monkeypox in several countries in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- There have also been several travel-associated clade I monkeypox cases reported in countries in other parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.\n- There's an outbreak of clade II monkeypox in West Africa. Several cases in the United States have been tied to travel from the area.\n- Clade II monkeypox cases continue to spread at low levels in many countries around the world.\n- CDC works with public health partners across the world to monitor for monkeypox cases and increase surveillance capacity, in addition to other activities.\n\n\n![A colorized transmission electron microscopic image of monkeypox virus particles, found within an infected cell](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/09/26500_lores.jpg)\n\n## Current situation\n\n### In the United States\n\n- Health authorities in Southern California have reported three cases of clade I monkeypox in people with no recent travel. All three individuals are recovering from the illness. Viral genomic (DNA fingerprint) data indicate that these three cases may be linked to a different US case reported in August 2025. For more information see [Community Spread of Clade I Mpox Within California](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/CAHAN/Community-Spread-of-Clade-I-Mpox-Within-California.aspx).\n- There have been six reported cases of clade I monkeypox in the United States in people who had recently traveled to affected areas associated with the outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- CDC regularly [assesses the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to the overall population and specific populations within the United States posed by the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/); it remains low.\n- Clade II monkeypox is [still circulating at low levels](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/data-research/cases/index.html).\n  - CDC is tracking a recent uptick of U.S. cases of clade II across several different states linked to an [outbreak of clade II monkeypox in Sierra Leone, Liberia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), and other West African countries. CDC is collaborating with U.S. laboratories and Sierra Leone contacts to better understand the situation.\n- Children have historically gotten monkeypox in endemic areas in Western and Central Africa, and in this outbreak the high number of children with monkeypox reported in likely reflects spread within households.\n  - Based on what we know right now, we [don't expect to see the same sort of risk in children](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/data-research/clade-i-monkeypox-in-children-in-africa-and-potential-impacts-on-children-in-the-united-states.html) if monkeypox were introduced in the United States for reasons including different household makeup and size, access to disinfecting products, and improved access to medical care.\n\n[Clade I Monkeypox Outbreak Originating in Central Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html)\n\nOutbreaks of clade I monkeypox are occurring in Central and Eastern Africa\n\n[Clade II Monkeypox Outbreaks around the World](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html)\n\nInformation on the ongoing outbreak of clade II monkeypox\n\n### Across the globe\n\n- There are [outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in Central and Eastern Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html).\n  - Clade I has two subclades, clade Ia and clade Ib.\n  - In Central Africa, people have gotten clade Ia monkeypox through contact with infected dead or live wild animals, household transmission, or patient care; a high proportion of clade Ia cases have been reported in children younger than 15 years of age.\n  - More recently, subclade Ib has been identified in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo and has spread through intimate and adult sexual contact, including heterosexual spread with sex trade workers. Further spread outside of eastern DRC has occurred.\n  - Based on what we know now, clade Ib monkeypox has a lower case-fatality rate than clade Ia monkeypox.\n- Sustained and local person-to-person spread of clade I monkeypox has taken place in some non-endemic countries through sexual contact, day-to-day household contact, and within the healthcare setting in the absence of personal protective equipment.\n- As of September 15, 2025, the countries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia are experiencing **sustained** human-to-human transmission of the virus; there is also evidence of sustained transmission in Central African Republic and Republic of the Congo.\n- As of September 15, 2025, countries reporting travel-associated cases of clade I monkeypox since January 1, 2024, include Angola, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zimbabwe.\n- The [ongoing global outbreak of clade IIb](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) monkeypox has caused more than 100,000 cases in 122 total countries, including 115 countries where monkeypox was not previously reported.\n- Sierra Leone, Liberia, and other countries in West Africa are experiencing an outbreak of **clade II monkeypox**.\n  - Travelers to Sierra Leone and Liberia should review the [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), which includes information about the [monkeypox vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html) for eligible people.\n\n### Global case data\n\nFor global case data since January 1, 2024, see [2022-24 Monkeypox (Monkeypox) Outbreak: Global Trends (shinyapps.io)](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/#8_Disclaimers). Confirmed cases include those that are laboratory confirmed as monkeypox virus and may include cases only confirmed as _orthopoxvirus_. These data are provided for situational awareness and are subject to change.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n### In Africa\n\n- CDC continues critical work to protect the United States from emerging and infectious diseases. CDC has collaborated closely with key partners in affected countries to help support efforts to stop monkeypox at the source.\n- CDC and in-country partners across Africa have worked together on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity-building, strengthening local workforce capacity, case investigation, strengthening case management, infection prevention and control, and vaccine strategy and planning.\n- CDC collaborated with governmental and civil society partners in affected countries to collect and analyze case data, and to identify how monkeypox is spreading.\n- CDC trained 80 field epidemiologists in DRC and continues to provide key support for many who are still working in priority health zones. These CDC-trained epidemiologists are playing a key role in DRC efforts to detect cases, trace and monitor contacts, and increase community awareness of monkeypox, while also collecting and sending specimens to labs for testing, and training healthcare workers to do the same.\n\n- CDC is coordinating technical assistance in response to urgent needs identified by national governments and local partners in the areas of laboratory, surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, case management, infection prevention and control, psychosocial support, and vaccine planning.\n- The U.S. government is also working closely with several other countries in the region to assist with monitoring the situation as new information becomes available.\n\n- CDC's staff stationed in several countries affected by or on the border with countries with monkeypox cases provide critical information to inform U.S. preparedness efforts. Staff are connected to CDC's response efforts and can provide critical, real-time information to inform CDC's understanding of the outbreak, mitigate importation of cases into the U.S., and inform U.S. preparedness efforts.\n- Response efforts include increasing the number of monkeypox testing sites; improving specimen transport networks to quickly identify new cases; assisting with Ministry of Health-led vaccine implementation; strengthening emergency management systems; improving case surveillance; and training healthcare workers on infection prevention and control.\n\n\n### In the United States\n\n- CDC works closely with state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments to provide recommendations for clinical management, diagnosis, and prevention of monkeypox cases in the U.S.\n- CDC continually increases capacity in communities across the United States for early detection of monkeypox through existing surveillance systems, including [wastewater testing](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance/mpox-data.html).\n\n- CDC raises awareness for healthcare providers, including the latest guidance for [considering monkeypox](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) as a possible diagnosis in certain patients.\n- CDC has information and recommendations for members of the public, including those traveling to Central or Eastern Africa: [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-drc-neighboring-countries) and [Health Alert Network](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp) advisory.\n- CDC works with researchers and partner organizations to increase health equity around monkeypox and ensure that the populations most affected by monkeypox have access to the monkeypox vaccine.\n- CDC [conducts assessments](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to determine the risks of monkeypox to the people in the United States.\n\n## Resources\n\n- Get monkeypox and other vaccine recommendations when traveling to Central and Eastern Africa: [Destinations \\| Travelers' Health \\| CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)\n- [Clade II Monkeypox in Liberia and Sierra Leone -

The risk to the general population is assessed as low.\n\n## As of October 20, 2025\n\n### New clade I monkeypox cases in the U.S.\n\nCalifornia has reported multiple clade I monkeypox cases stemming from local transmission of the virus. Our risk assessment **remains unchanged**, since the original assessment considered the likelihood of local spread of clade I monkeypox in the United States.\n\n## As of November 18, 2024\n\nCDC assessed the risk to the United States overall population and specific populations within the United States posed by the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and in countries in Central and Eastern Africa:\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2025/01/mpox_RA_table_all_Jan2025update.jpg)\n\n![Table showing Risk posed by the clade I monkeypox to the United States. See methods section for information on definitions.](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2025/01/mpox_RA_table_all_Jan2025update.jpg)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox to the United States. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to provide context about the ongoing outbreak of clade I monkeypox in DRC and in countries in Central and Eastern Africa, to inform U.S. preparedness efforts.\n\nThis assessment is an update to our August 30, 2024 [risk assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/previous-mpox-risk-assessment-august-update/index.html), incorporating new evidence and breaking out specific populations at risk. We note that the overall U.S. population includes the specific populations assessed, but we include specific populations separately because the clade I monkeypox outbreak in DRC and in countries in Central and Eastern Africa may pose higher risks to these populations. We chose these specific populations based on the most common monkeypox transmission routes for both the current clade I outbreak and the clade IIb outbreak that began in 2022.\n\nWe assessed overall risk by considering both likelihood and impact of infection in each population (see Methods section), under the assumption that a clade I monkeypox case was introduced into each population of interest. Both the likelihood and impact of infection are assessed at a population level. Likelihood of infection considers factors such as pathogen infectiousness and population susceptibility, while impact of infection considers factors such as disease severity, treatment availability, and public health response resources.\n\nWe assess risk to each population under the assumption that a clade I monkeypox case is introduced to these same populations. As of November 18, 2024, we are aware of the [first case](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s1116-california-first-clade.html) of clade I monkeypox in the United States; given there has been no spread beyond this case to date, this assessment does not change.\n\nWe [continue to monitor](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/situation-summary/index.html) the [outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in Central and Eastern Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2023/index.html) and will update this risk assessment if new information warrants changes.\n\n## Risk to the overall U.S. population\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-overall.png)\n\n![Table displaying very low likelihood, low to moderate impact, low risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to the overall U.S. population by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-overall.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to the overall U.S. population. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nWe assess the likelihood of infection for the overall U.S. population is [**very low**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).\n\nCDC experts believe transmission levels would likely be reduced in the United States compared to levels in DRC for several reasons, including smaller average household sizes, [modeling results](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-transmission.html), increased access to improved sanitation and healthcare, and the lack of zoonotic reservoirs of disease. We address risk for specific populations in the sections below.\n\n### Impact\n\nWe assess the impact of infection for the overall U.S. population is [**low to moderate**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html) **.**\n\nMost of the United States population has no immunity to the virus that causes monkeypox, leading to potentially higher impacts of infection. Additionally, acquired [immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) from previous infection with the virus that causes monkeypox is extremely low for the overall population. Vaccine-induced immunity from [monkeypox vaccination during the 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7213a4.htm?s_cid=mm7213a4_w) clade II monkeypox outbreak is also very low across the overall population. During the 2022 clade II monkeypox outbreak, vaccination was targeted to those at highest risk of infection, including men who have sex with men (MSM) with certain risk factors and their partners. Furthermore, [smallpox vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7233a3.htm) rates, which can offer some protection against monkeypox, declined substantially in the United States in the 1970s, when population-wide smallpox vaccination ceased due to eradication of the disease.\n\nOf note, the [reported](https://africacdc.org/download/africa-cdc-weekly-event-based-surveillance-report-november-2024/) case-fatality rate (CFR; 3%) in DRC from the ongoing clade I monkeypox outbreak is lower than reported rates from historical outbreaks (up to 11%). In addition to lower [reported](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) CFRs in the ongoing clade I monkeypox outbreak, morbidity and mortality from clade I monkeypox are likely to be lower in the United States as compared to DRC and neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Africa, because of greater access to high-quality supportive care and medical countermeasures, leading to potentially a lower impact of infection.\n\n## Risk to children\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-children.png)\n\n![Table displaying very low likelihood, moderate impact, low risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to U.S. children by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-children.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to U.S. children. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess that the likelihood of infection for children for clade I monkeypox through household transmission and direct contact would be **[very low](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html)**.\n\nWe do not expect transmission via household transmission or direct, non-sexual contact in the United States to reach levels observed in DRC, [nor affect children to the same degree](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/php/data-research/clade-i-mpox-in-children-in-africa-and-potential-impacts-on-children-in-the-united-states.html). Our assessment is based on [modeling results,](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-transmission.html) a smaller proportion of children in the U.S. population (18% under 15 years of age in the United States compared to [46%](https://www.unicef.org/media/100616/file/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo-2020-COAR.pdf) in DRC), smaller average U.S. household size, generally increased access to improved sanitation and healthcare in the United States, and the lack of the virus that causes monkeypox circulating in animals in the United States.\n\n[CDC modeling](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-transmission.html) suggests that direct contact transmission within and between households—including spread between children at daycares and schools—is unlikely to result in a large number of clade l monkeypox cases in the United States. Modeling results indicated that household transmission clusters would likely involve 10 or fewer monkeypox clade I cases, with minimal spread between households. Of note, these modeling results are based on clade Ia transmission dynamics and may be revised as new data become available on the more recently discovered clade Ib and its transmission dynamics.\n\nWe simulated household transmission through direct contact and transmission to other households through children's direct contact with other children at daycares and schools. Direct contact involves skin-to-skin contact and other direct contact with the virus that causes monkeypox, such as through sharing contaminated toys or bedding; this virus is not known to spread efficiently through respiratory secretions and is not known to be airborne.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess that the impact posed to children for clade I monkeypox through household transmission and direct, non-sexual contact would be **[moderate](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).**\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined in the above impact section, household and direct contact settings such as daycares or schools could be more impacted due to more significant disruption to daily activities and additional resources for public health measures. Monkeypox infection can be serious in children, and the vast majority of U.S. children have no immunity to monkeypox. Very few children in the United States have acquired [immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) from either previous infection with the virus that causes monkeypox, or vaccination with monkeypox or smallpox vaccines.\n\n## Risk to MSM via sexual transmission\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-msm.png)\n\n![Table displaying low to moderate likelihood, low to moderate impact, low to moderate risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to MSM via sexual transmission by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-msm.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to the overall U.S. population. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the likelihood of infection via sexual transmission for MSM and for people who have sex with MSM is **[low to moderate](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html)**. Of note, MSM with higher numbers of sexual partners may have a higher likelihood of exposure to the virus and thus their risk would be closer to the moderate risk range. If clade I monkeypox were introduced into this population, there would likely be sustained transmission of the virus, based on several factors, including widespread transmission in this population during the ongoing global clade IIb monkeypox outbreak that began in 2022, varying levels of population immunity, and insights from CDC modeling studies.\n\nMost U.S. cases of clade IIb monkeypox were among MSM and their sexual partners, suggesting this population could have the highest likelihood of exposure for clade I monkeypox if the virus spread to U.S. sexual networks. Additionally, only a minority of MSM whom CDC has recommended would benefit from vaccination have been fully vaccinated, though rates vary widely by jurisdiction. However, population immunity to monkeypox infection might reduce the risk of infection with clade I monkeypox, depending on levels of vaccination uptake and monkeypox infection following the 2022 outbreak of clade IIb monkeypox, which varies across communities in the United States. In addition, during the 2022 global monkeypox outbreak in the United States, MSM reported behavior adaptations that likely contributed to declines in monkeypox incidence, indicating that similar changes could occur in future outbreaks, leading to a reduced likelihood of infection at a population level.\n\nA 2023 [modeling study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10231941/) estimated that a jurisdiction's risk for sustained monkeypox recurrence depends on population monkeypox immunity levels, finding some [jurisdictions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10231941/table/T1/?report=objectonly) may have a high likelihood of sustained transmission. More recent [CDC modeling](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/modeling-forecasting/mpox-gbmsm-technical-brief.html) found that counties with higher population-level immunity had decreased chances of a prolonged or large outbreak, relative to counties with lower immunity, if clade I monkeypox were to be introduced to MSM sexual networks in the United States. The study also found that counties with greater than 50% population-level immunity would have smaller outbreaks on average, involving fewer than 50 infections.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the impact of infection via sexual transmission for MSM and for people who have sex with MSM would be **[low to moderate](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html)**.\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined in the above impact sections, population immunity among MSM and their sexual partners is likely to additionally reduce the severity of infection. However, population immunity varies greatly across communities in the United States, meaning some communities would have higher impacts of infection than others. Additionally, outbreaks concentrated in MSM communities, even if less severe than the 2022 clade IIb monkeypox outbreak, will have a large impact in these communities and require significant public health resources.\n\n## Risk to adults via sexual transmission between men and women\n\n[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-adults.png)\n\n![Table displaying very low to low likelihood, low impact, low risk, and moderate confidence for risk posed to adults via sexual transmission between men and women by clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/media/images/2024/11/mpox-RA-tables-adults.png)\n\nRisk posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak to adults via sexual transmission between men and women. Please see methods section for further information on definitions of terms.\n\n### Likelihood\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the likelihood of infection for adults via sexual transmission between men and women would be [**very low to low**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).\n\nSustained, widespread sexual transmission of clade I monkeypox in adults via sexual transmission between men and women in the United States is unlikely, based on lack of widespread transmission in heterosexual sexual networks during the [2022 global clade IIb monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7132e3.htm?s_cid=mm7132e3_w), as well as insights from modeling studies. A [modeling study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38816-8) from the United Kingdom related to the 2022 outbreak indicated that lower partnership formation rates among heterosexuals prevented sustained transmission within these networks. Additionally, CDC modeling of the clade IIb outbreak has shown similar results for heterosexual sexual networks in the United States, indicating widespread transmission is unlikely.1 Results showed that clade I monkeypox could cause small clusters of cases in heterosexual sexual networks, including especially among sex workers and their contacts, and as such, likelihood of infection could be higher in these communities.\n\nEvidence of sexual transmission and transboundary spread in Central and Eastern Africa could indicate an increased risk of spread if clade I monkeypox is introduced to the United States. Outbreaks of clade I monkeypox associated with female sex workers and their contacts have been reported in some DRC provinces. Recent [genomic](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.13.24311951v1) [analyses](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) suggest that transmission of clade Ib monkeypox is primarily human-to-human and not due to recurring zoonotic introductions. The role of different monkeypox subclades in changing transmission dynamics remains uncertain.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf clade I monkeypox were to be introduced by this route, we assess the impact of infection for adults via sexual transmission between men and women would be [**low**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html) **.**\n\nIn addition to the factors outlined in above impact sections, the impact of infection could be greater for sex workers and individuals in high-contact sexual networks. However, behavioral adaptation in affected populations could play a role in reducing transmission, similar to what CDC observed in the [2022 outbreak](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.02.003). That said, adaptation may be harder to achieve in the context of sex work due to its effect on people's livelihoods, and vaccination in this community may be a more effective method of prevention. CDC and other public health agencies will likely require additional public health resources to reach hard-to-reach populations like sex workers and their contacts, leading to a higher impact of infection in this community.\n\n## Confidence\n\nWe have **moderate** [**confidence**](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html) in this assessment, increased from low confidence in our last assessment (released on August 30, 2024), as more data has been collected on both disease transmission and differences between clade subtypes in DRC and neighboring countries in Central and Eastern Africa. We note the following uncertainties:\n\n- Implications for the United States are unclear due to the fact that most of the data from the recent spread of the clade I monkeypox outbreak originate in Central and Eastern Africa, which has different access to healthcare and social, economic, and cultural contexts.\n\n- Limited epidemiologic and genomic data are available regarding outbreaks in Central and Eastern Africa, including lack of detailed transmission dynamics in children and sexual networks.\n\n- Limited information is available on main routes of transmission and how these differ between the two circulating subclades of clade I _Monkeypox virus_, which leads to uncertainties in how extensively the virus could spread in the United States.\n\n- Inadequate data on the levels of prior immunity in MSM and their sexual partners and the extent to which behavior adaptations initiated during the 2022 outbreak have continued or will return.\n\n## Factors that could change our assessment\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#)\n\n### Geographic and population spread\n\n- Further detection of clade I monkeypox cases in the United States, particularly if there is evidence of domestic person-to-person transmission\n\n- Detection of clade I monkeypox outbreaks and sustained transmission in Europe or other regions with high volume of travel to the United States\n\n- Extensive clade I monkeypox spread outside Central and Eastern Africa, including among people attending mass gatherings or among other highly mobile populations\n\n### Transmission dynamics\n\n- Further evidence of person-to-person spread in Central or East African countries, outside of already recognized [activities](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/causes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html) that increase risk, such as exposure to animals or close contact with persons with monkeypox\n\n- Further evidence of widespread, prolonged chains of sexual transmission in non-endemic countries\n\n### Natural history and medical countermeasures\n\n- Further evidence of differentiated epidemiological patterns between monkeypox clades Ia and Ib\n\n- Data that suggests an increased or decreased illness severity of clade I monkeypox infection\n\n- Increased monkeypox vaccination coverage among groups at increased risk in the United States\n\n- Evidence of waning vaccine-induced immunity\n\n## Background and Methods\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#)\n\n### Ongoing outbreak and spread\n\nAs of November 18, 2024, the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://africacdc.org/download/africa-cdc-weekly-event-based-surveillance-report-november-2024) has resulted in almost 43,000 confirmed or suspected cases in 2024, including in Kinshasa and other urban areas of DRC. Cases in other regions of DRC with cross-border movement, such as Équateur and South Kivu Provinces, elevate the risk of disease spread outside of the country. As of November 18, 2024, there were 22 clade I monkeypox cases, including confirmed, probable, and suspected cases, in the neighboring Republic of the Congo, where clade Ia monkeypox is endemic. There are 71 confirmed clade I monkeypox cases in the neighboring Central African Republic, where clade Ia monkeypox is also endemic.\n\nClade lb monkeypox has more recently spread to non-endemic countries in Africa, including 1,834 confirmed cases in Burundi, 26 confirmed cases in Rwanda, 443 confirmed cases in Uganda, and 17 confirmed cases in Kenya, as of November 18, 2024. Epidemiologic data are [limited](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report-35--12-august-2024) for patients with monkeypox, and because of lack of laboratory confirmatory testing, we do not know the true number of cases. [Sustained spread](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.27.24314511v1.full.pdf) is occurring in Burundi and Uganda based on the geographic distribution of cases.\n\n### Travel-related cases\n\nSince August 15, Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and the UK have confirmed travel-associated cases of clade Ib monkeypox. These cases highlight the risk for travel-associated importations. As of November 16, there has been one reported clade I monkeypox case in the United States.\n\n### Descriptive Epidemiology\n\n_Monkeypox virus_ is divided into two clades (I and II) and four subclades (Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb). Clade I has different transmission dynamics by subclade, with clade Ia spreading through multiple modes of transmission including contact with infected animals, household contact, and sexual contact. Clade Ib appears predominantly to be spread through [intimate](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/causes/index.html) or sexual contact between adults.\n\nClade I monkeypox is endemic in Central Africa, and there are concurrent, ongoing outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in DRC. In previous outbreaks, clade I has caused a higher number of persons to have severe disease than clade II within close-contact settings, typically in a household. Historically, household transmission chains were typically small, although occasionally had involved up to [six generations of transmission](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/6/15-0579_article). While limited data are available, household transmission has likely played an important role in the current clade Ia outbreak in DRC, particularly for children. Transmission through patient care, in the absence of appropriate personal protective equipment, has also occurred. Transmission risk is highest among unvaccinated contacts; children and young adults are less likely to have vaccine-induced orthopoxvirus immunity since smallpox vaccination programs ended in [DRC](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1005769107), other affected countries, and the United States.\n\nAlthough clade I monkeypox is endemic in DRC, in 2023, health authorities began reporting a higher number of suspect cases and deaths across a wider geographic area that in some provinces affected atypical demographic groups. Approximately 66% of suspected monkeypox cases in DRC in 2024 were in children under age 15, similar to historical observations. However, areas that did not historically report monkeypox saw different transmission dynamics. For instance, adults were disproportionately affected in South Kivu province, where sexual transmission among adults was predominant. The South Kivu outbreak spread initially among [female sex workers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.05.24303395v1.full.pdf) before becoming more broadly distributed, with one [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.18.24313835v1.full-text) finding more than 80% of hospitalized cases reporting recent sexual contact in bars. Sexual transmission of clade I monkeypox was also confirmed in a small outbreak affecting MSM and women in [Kenge, Kwango](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/1/23-1164_article) Province, in March 2023.\n\nThe outbreaks in South Kivu and, more recently, in several East African countries, have been associated with clade Ib monkeypox. The younger age distribution of cases in Burundi—which has seen the most clade Ib cases outside of DRC—suggests that non-sexual transmission of clade Ib is also occurring. Clade Ib is a more recently detected sub-clade, and data from the DRC and a previous [animal study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22496894/) suggests clade Ib monkeypox cases appear to be clinically milder than clade Ia monkeypox cases. In addition, clade Ib monkeypox cases in DRC and Burundi have been associated with a [lower case fatality rate than clade Ia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03130-3) monkeypox cases.\n\nAs of November 16, 2024, one case of clade I monkeypox has been detected in the United States. In collaboration with public health partners and other government agencies, CDC has already increased surveillance, laboratory diagnostic, and case data reporting capacities, and provided clinician education to prepare for the possibility of clade I monkeypox cases occurring in the United States. CDC also continues to work, including with other U.S. government agencies, on multiple approaches to expand clade-specific testing domestically. The United States has monkeypox testing capacity in state public health laboratories and several commercial laboratories, including clade-specific testing and/or sequencing, and can also (in some laboratories) flag high-likelihood clade I monkeypox samples. Through a combination of these methods, up to 80% of monkeypox specimens are being clade typed within the United States.\n\n### Methods\n\nCDC subject-matter experts specializing in risk assessment methods, infectious disease modeling, global health, and monkeypox and other orthopoxviruses collaborated to develop this rapid assessment. Experts initially convened in February 2024 to discuss the need for an assessment examining the risks posed by the DRC outbreak to the United States, key evidence related to the DRC outbreak, and specific populations to include in the assessment. To conduct this assessment, experts considered evidence including epidemiologic data from Central and Eastern Africa, data from the ongoing 2022 monkeypox outbreak in the United States caused by clade IIb, and historical data on clade I monkeypox outbreaks in DRC. After the initial assessment was finalized in February, experts subsequently re-reviewed evidence and updated this assessment in early March, mid-March, mid-April, late June, late August, and November.\n\nOverall risk was estimated by combining the likelihood of infection and the impact of the disease. For example, low likelihood of infection combined with high impact of disease would result in moderate risk. The likelihood of infection refers to the probability that members of the overall U.S. population acquire monkeypox—which in turn depends on the likelihood of exposure, infectiousness of the disease, and susceptibility of the population. The impact of infection considers several factors, including the severity of disease, level of population immunity, availability of treatments, and necessary public health response resources. A degree of confidence was assigned to each level of the assessment, taking into account evidence quality, extent, and corroboration of information.\n\nFor more details on our methods, please see our rapid risk assessment [methods webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/about/risk-assessment-methods.html).\n\n## Previous Updates\n\nSee our [previous Monkeypox Risk Assessment since August 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/previous-mpox-risk-assessment-august-update/index.html).\n\nSee other [archived previous updates](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/mpox-previous-updates.html) of the Monkeypox Rapid Risk Assessment.\n\nOct. 20, 2025\n\n[Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#content-sources) [Print](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#print) [Share](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html#share)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html \"Share to Facebook\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html&title=Risk%20to%20United%20States%20from%20clade%20I%20monkeypox%20outbreak%20in%20Central%20and%20Eastern%20Africa \"Share to LinkedIn\") [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcfa-qualitative-assessments%2Fphp%2Fdata-research%2Fmpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html&text=Risk%20to%20United%20States%20from%20clade%20I%20monkeypox%20outbreak%20in%20Central%20and%20Eastern%20Africa \"Share to Twitter\") [Syndicate](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/sharecontent \"Embed this Page\")\n\nContent Source:\n\n[Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html)\n\nSources\n\n- Pollock E, Nakazawa Y, Asher J, Gift T, Spicknall I.

It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever.  It can make people very sick and leave scars.\n\nA global outbreak of mpox began in May 2022 and continues to this day. In recent months, cases have been increasing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

This report describes the characteristics of laboratory-confirmed clade Ib mpox cases in Kenya during the first 7 months of the outbreak. Among 447 suspected cases during July 2024–February 2025, a total of 48 (10.7%) were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. Most confirmed cases occurred along a highway from the Indian Ocean port in Mombasa to Malaba at the Ugandan border, a transportation corridor that links Kenya to other East and Central African countries. Among the 48 confirmed cases, 27 (56.3%) occurred among persons associated with the transportation corridor, including truck drivers (12; 25.0%), sex workers (eight; 16.7%), and persons employed at or near trucking stopovers (seven; 14.6%). Sexual transmission was suspected in 30 (62.5%) cases, based on the patient’s history or locations of the lesions; 11 (22.9%) patients also had HIV infection, one of whom died. Clade Ib MPXV in Kenya appears to be primarily sexually transmitted and concentrated in specific groups at high risk for infection. Public health measures, including vaccination, might be most effective if they focus on these specific groups and geographic areas.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\n## Introduction\n\nMpox is an emerging global public health threat, with outbreaks primarily caused by clade II _Monkeypox virus_ (MPXV) reported from multiple countries since 2022 ( _1_– _3_). Since late 2023, the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported an increase in cases caused by a newly recognized subclade, clade Ib MPXV. This strain has spread primarily through sexual transmission in countries that have not previously reported mpox cases ( _3_, _4_). In August 2024, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization both escalated the clade Ib mpox outbreak to their highest respective public health threat levels.\\* Although clade I MPXV has historically been associated with small outbreaks in Central Africa after zoonotic transmission in rural forested areas with limited human-to-human spread, sustained human-to-human transmission appears to be an important characteristic of this outbreak ( _5_, _6_). Information on the epidemiologic characteristics of clade Ib mpox is limited. Kenya confirmed its first clade Ib mpox case on July 29, 2024.† This report describes the characteristics of patients with confirmed mpox cases during the first 7 months of the clade Ib outbreak. These findings can be used to guide response strategies.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\n## Methods\n\n### Data Sources\n\nEpidemiologic and clinical information was extracted from mpox outbreak investigation documents for July 29, 2024, through February 28, 2025, including case investigation forms, outbreak investigation reports, and information from health care facilities about characteristics of patients with confirmed cases. Persons with suspected infection identified at health care facilities or through contact tracing investigations were isolated, either at a health facility or at their homes, and interviewed by public health workers using a standardized questionnaire to collect demographic, clinical, and behavioral information. Contact tracing was conducted for persons with confirmed mpox cases to identify potential secondary cases. A suspected mpox case was defined as the occurrence of an unexplained rash and at least one constitutional symptom (headache, fever of >101.3°F \\[>38.5°C\\], lymphadenopathy, myalgia, back pain, or asthenia) in a person with either recent (within the preceding 3 weeks) travel to a country experiencing an mpox outbreak or contact with such a person within the preceding 3 weeks. A confirmed case was defined as a suspected case with a positive MPXV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or genomic sequencing result. MPXV PCR testing was performed at the Kenya National Public Health Laboratory.§ The MPXV clade was confirmed through genomic sequencing ( _7_) at the Kenya Medical Research Institute/Walter Reed Army Institute of Research laboratory in Kisumu.\n\n### Exposure Categories\n\nMPXV exposures were categorized as suspected sexual contact, nonsexual contact, or unknown contact. Cases suspected to be sexually transmitted were those diagnosed in a person who reported a new sexual partner or who engaged in transactional sex during their incubation period and those for which the investigation suggested exposure through sex (e.g., a symptomatic sexual partner or primary lesions in the genital area). Nonsexually transmitted cases were defined as those for which the investigation did not suggest sexual transmission (e.g., a case in a child living in the same household). The exposure category for cases that were not classified as sexually or nonsexually transmitted were classified as unknown. A prodrome was defined as experiencing any signs or symptoms (e.g., fever or headache) at least 1 day before rash onset.\n\n### Analysis\n\nDescriptive analyses of confirmed cases¶ were performed in R (version 4.4.2; R Foundation). The Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) and county health departments granted permission to conduct investigations as part of an ongoing public health emergency, and patients consented to interviews and MPXV testing. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.\\*\\*\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of Patients with Confirmed Clade Ib Mpox\n\nAmong 447 suspected cases tested by PCR during July 2024–February 2025, a total of 48 (10.7%) were confirmed positive. All confirmed clade Ib mpox cases in Kenya ( [Figure 1](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#F1_down)) were detected along a transportation corridor that connects Kenya’s international southeastern seaport in Mombasa with Malaba, on the country’s western border with Uganda ( [Figure 2](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#F2_down)). Among the 48 persons with confirmed mpox, 28 (58.3%) were women, and the median age was 35.0 years (IQR: 29.0–38.0 years) ( [Table](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#T1_down)). Three (6.3%) were children aged ≤14 years. Eleven (22.9%) patients had HIV infection, all of whom had received some HIV treatment. A prodrome was reported by 17 (35.4%) patients. All persons with confirmed cases developed a generalized body rash, and 33 (68.7%) had genital lesions. Most patients had at least one health care visit for their illness before mpox was suspected, including 24 (50.0%) with one visit and 16 (33.3%) with two or more visits. The median interval between rash onset and laboratory confirmation was 7.5 days (IQR: 5–13 days).\n\n### Outcomes of Patients with Confirmed Clade Ib Mpox\n\nOne patient died. The patient had advanced HIV disease and was not receiving antiretroviral therapy.†† The death occurred 30 days after rash onset while the patient was hospitalized for cryptococcal meningitis and had secondarily superinfected anogenital lesions and severe constipation. In addition, a pregnant woman delivered a stillborn fetus at 38 gestational weeks. All other patients recovered.\n\n### Potential Sources of Exposure\n\nAmong patients with confirmed cases, 18 (37.5%) reported travel to nearby countries experiencing active clade Ib mpox outbreaks during their incubation period (i.e., DRC, Rwanda, Tanzania, or Uganda); five (10.4%) did not have an epidemiologic link to any other cases or report recent travel. Twelve cases (25.0%) occurred in truck drivers; eight (16.7%) in sex workers, all of whom reported having clients who were truck drivers; and seven (14.6%) in persons employed at or near truck stopovers. Genomic sequencing of specimens from 33 patients with confirmed mpox identified the circulating strain as clade Ib MPXV (Kenya MOH, Mpox Situation Report 180, unpublished data, March 3, 2025).\n\nMPXV was suspected to have been transmitted through sexual contact for 30 (62.5%) patients; other means of transmission included close, nonsexual household contact (five; 10.4%) and unknown means (13; 27.1%). The median number of close contacts per case was 7.5 persons (IQR: 4.3–15.8). Among 490 identified close contacts, 10 secondary cases were identified (secondary transmission rate: 2.0%).\n\n### Public Health Response\n\nThe Kenya MOH led the mpox outbreak response. MOH activated the Kenya Public Health Emergency Operations Center (EOC), an incident management system, after detecting the index case, and affected counties activated their county-level emergency operations centers. Field epidemiologists investigated confirmed cases and conducted contact tracing. Persons with a diagnosis of confirmed mpox were isolated in hospitals or their homes. MOH heightened its mpox surveillance, including developing and circulating case definitions and clinical management guidelines for frontline health workers across Kenya. MOH also intensified screening measures at points of entry§§ for travelers with mpox signs and symptoms, linking travelers with suspected cases to public health workers, as well as increased distribution of mpox information. Laboratory systems were strengthened with MPXV PCR capability established in four laboratories in Kenya, and genomic sequencing was used to confirm the clade ( _7_). Kenya instituted public awareness efforts by briefing the media, distributing educational materials, and meeting with affected groups and the public. Kenya requested and received mpox vaccine as part of the Access and Allocation Mechanism and is planning a July 2025 vaccination campaign for the highest risk groups.¶¶ Through the EOC, MOH collaborated with other Kenyan government agencies and multilateral entities to respond to the mpox outbreak.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\n## Discussion\n\nA clade Ib mpox outbreak has been occurring in Kenya since July 2024. Most confirmed cases occurred in persons associated with the transportation corridor that links Kenya to other East and Central African countries, many of which have ongoing clade Ib mpox outbreaks. The interaction between truck drivers and sex workers might play a role in mpox transmission in this country. Evidence of secondary transmission appears limited; however, the risk for ongoing transmission remains because of the country’s regional commercial connectivity. Widespread mpox in Kenya could directly affect the health care system, which is already managing an HIV epidemic; HIV is a risk factor for severe mpox ( _8_). Although HIV affects the general population in Kenya, certain populations are disproportionately affected, including sex workers. The one reported death associated with clade Ib mpox in Kenya occurred in a person with HIV infection that was complicated by an opportunistic infection. Public health interventions, including mpox vaccination, that focus on groups at high risk for infection could be important to mitigating additional spread and limiting morbidity and mortality.\n\nKenya’s mpox outbreak highlights the challenges of controlling infectious disease outbreaks in highly connected geographic regions. Multiple mpox cases in persons who traveled to countries with widespread clade Ib transmission and who had no epidemiologic links to other cases in Kenya suggest that multiple introductions are occurring in the country. However, the identification of cases in persons with no travel history or epidemiologic link to other cases also suggests undetected community transmission in Kenya. Genomic epidemiology might supplement epidemiologic findings from case investigations by providing insights into potential transmission networks among cases that otherwise seem unrelated. Whereas many initial infections appear to have been acquired through sexual contact, subsequent transmission within households can occur if appropriate isolation measures are not implemented.\n\nDuring the first 7 months of the clade Ib mpox outbreak in Kenya, the country documented approximately 500 MPXV tests. Although MOH has circulated case definitions and trained health care workers in mpox diagnosis, case management, and infection prevention, the testing numbers are low, possibly reflecting lack of knowledge about mpox in the general public and among health care workers. Some patients made several health care visits before mpox was suspected. The differential diagnosis of mpox is broad. One of the primary conditions that confounds diagnosis is infection with varicella (chickenpox) ( _9_, _10_), which causes seasonal outbreaks in Kenya. Additional outreach to increase awareness of mpox signs and symptoms could facilitate timely detection of cases and isolation of patients. Although multiple laboratories in Kenya can conduct molecular testing, mpox testing was only available in four laboratories in Nairobi and Kisumu during the period in this report. Expanding mpox laboratory diagnostics in other geographic areas and using rapid diagnostic tests with adequate sensitivity could also reduce the time between symptom onset and mpox confirmation. Vaccinating persons highest at risk for acquiring mpox might help halt transmission within Kenya and to other countries.\n\nThe increasing numbers of mpox cases globally in recent years is likely a result of many factors. These include increases in mpox exposures (i.e., increases in sexual transmission, ease of international travel, and encounters with animal reservoirs), improvements in disease surveillance, and decreasing population-level immunity to orthopoxviruses, the genus that includes MPXV and _Variola virus_ (smallpox), as the cohort vaccinated against smallpox ages ( _3_).\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. During outbreaks, staff members responsible for data collection often are also responding to other demands of the public health emergency, which can affect the completeness and quality of the data. Second, surveillance and laboratory gaps might have resulted in missed cases and an overall underestimation of total number of cases.\n\n### Implications for Public Heath Practice\n\nAs the mpox outbreak evolves in Kenya, public health measures focusing on interventions to interrupt transmission are critical, such as vaccination of persons at highest risk for infection, including truck drivers and sex workers (preexposure prophylaxis) and close contacts of mpox patients (postexposure prophylaxis).\\*\\*\\* The strengths of Kenya’s existing HIV program could be used to improve risk communication and outreach efforts and minimize mpox-associated morbidity and mortality among groups disproportionately affected by both viruses. Public health messaging focusing on sexual and nonsexual transmission also are important for controlling the outbreak. These interventions could help protect populations at risk for severe mpox, including those living with HIV, and help prevent mpox transmission to other countries.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nNaomi Arusei, Antony Chepkwony, Caroline Cheptoo, Annette Chesir, Fatuma Hassan, Grace Kalaui, Barbara Koech, Gabriel Kyenze, Habiba Mohamed, Lucy Munyeki, Edward Munyi, Fredrick Mutisya, Jemima Mwangi, Moses Njiru, Mercy Njuguna, Mohamed Noor, Raphael Nyawa, Ken Ogello, Emmanuel Sigei, Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program; Yusuf Ajack, Mercy Cheptoo, Oscar Gaunya, Valentine Kabita, Rosalia Kalani; David Kareko, Nicholas Kurgat, Wycliffe Matini, Abdirizack Mohamed, Komu Mutunga, Francis Ng’ang’a, Michelle Wangui, Bonface Waweru, Kenya Ministry of Health; the county governments of Kenya.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\nCorresponding author: Pius Mutuku, [nthwao@gmail.com](mailto:nthwao@gmail.com).\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\n* * *\n\n1Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, Nairobi, Kenya; 2Africa Field Epidemiology Network, Nairobi, Kenya; 3Division of Disease Surveillance and Response, Ministry of Health, Nairobi, Kenya; 4National Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Nairobi, Kenya; 5Public Health Emergency Operations Centre, Ministry of Health, Nairobi, Kenya; 6Division of Global Health Protection, CDC Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.\n\n[Top](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7422a2.htm#)\n\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

The current review reports the latest update of Mpox cases from 25 February 2022 to 29 April 2025. It also evaluates the possible major complications in human life caused by Mpox. In early 2022, more than 40 countries reported Mpox outbreaks. As of 12 June 2024, the global case count for the 2022–2023 Mpox outbreak was 97,281 confirmed cases, in 118 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Mpox virus, a zoonotic disease, a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 14 August 2024. Mpox symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and face-to-body rashes. The review also highlights Mpox virus replication, genomics, pathology, transmission, diagnosis, and antiviral therapies. The 2022 outbreak is also discussed in detail. The coinfection of HIV in patients infected with Mpox is also discussed. The evolving Mpox epidemiology has raised concerns about the disease’s increasing spread in non-endemic countries, emphasizing the urgent need for control and prevention. The discussion on preventive measures, including vaccination, suggests that cross-protection against Mpox may be possible using orthopoxvirus-specific antibodies. Although there are no specific antiviral drugs available, certain drugs, such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, and ribavirin, are worth considering.\n\n**Keywords:** monkeypox (Mpox), pathology, complication, virus replication, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of Mpox\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nMonkeypox is a viral disease caused by the Mpox virus. According to the latest report (29 April 2025) of the World Health Organization (WHO) globally, 137,892 confirmed cases of Mpox have been reported from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2025. Out of these, 317 deaths were confirmed across 132 countries \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B1-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA with around 200 kb of nucleotides, which is brick-shaped and has a tubule-like structure on its surface \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B2-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, it has a dumbbell-shaped core structure that measures up to 200 to 250 nm. This virus belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) and the family of _poxviridae_ \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B3-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox resembles smallpox, and the disease is spread via zoonosis. There are two clades of Mpox: clade I (formerly the Central African clade or the Congo Basin clade) and Clade II (formerly the West African clade). Both have a sequence similarity of about 95%. The fatality rate of clade I is three times higher than that of clade II \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B4-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox has a linear DNA genome that contains around 190 non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B5-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox genomes contain a highly conserved central region, while the terminal region is highly variable, having inverted terminal repeats (ITR) \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B6-viruses-17-00753)\\]. All Mpox viruses have four ORFs in the ITR region \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B5-viruses-17-00753), [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B7-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The gene loss at the terminal region acts as a driving force for the evolution of the new Mpox. The ultrastructural analysis study in 2022 revealed that virus replication occurs in the mini-nucleus, which is reorganized by endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the host cell. The early mRNA and late mRNA form in the mini nucleus, which consecutively form the early protein and the late protein. As a result, an intracellular mature virus (IMV) is released in the cytoplasm and comes outside of the cell by exocytosis to form an enveloped extracellular virus or extracellular mature virus (EMV), which is ready to infect another host cell \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B8-viruses-17-00753)\\] ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f001)). Mpox is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, although the Mpox virus DNA was detected in semen and seminal fluid samples in Italy and Germany in the 2022 global outbreak. Despite various studies on the Mpox virus, the anal or vaginal route can be considered a mucosal membrane route \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B9-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Virus mutation and the re-emergence of pathogens with unusual transmission routes may enhance infection and increase the possibility of an epidemic.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/a349ee514556/viruses-17-00753-g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f001/)\n\nThe schematic representation of intracellular mature virus releasing in a host cell, the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) assemble and form mini nuclei in a host cell, and a large number of mitochondria are found near the mini nuclei. The replication of viral DNA occurs and forms m-RNA, which further forms viral protein, which is covered with an envelope and forms an intracellular mature virus.\n\nSince 2022, two major Mpox outbreaks have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare public health emergencies of international concern, first in July 2022 and again in August 2024. The initial global spread, attributed to a clade 2b strain, resulted in roughly 100,000 cases and 200 fatalities \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B10-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Subsequently, a new clade, 1b, emerged, leading to a second surge. As of December 2024, this recent outbreak has seen over 55,000 reported or suspected cases and approximately 1000 deaths, primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring nations such as Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B11-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Isolated cases of clade 1b have also been documented in countries including the UK, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, France, the USA, Canada, and Thailand. The details of the outbreaks of 2024 and 2022 are as follows.\n\n### 1.1. The 2024 Outbreak\n\nThe Mpox clade 1b variant, initially detected in the Sud Kivu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has emerged as a major public health threat due to its increased ability to spread between people \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B12-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Genetic investigation of clade 1b has uncovered numerous mutations of Mpox. The genetic makeup of clade 1b shows several mutations in genes related to the enzyme apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) cytosine deaminase. This enzyme’s involvement is often indicative of sustained human-to-human transmission \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B13-viruses-17-00753)\\]. These genetic alterations distinguish clade 1b from the traditionally circulating clade I variant, enabling more efficient spread through close physical contact, including sexual contact.\n\nGenetic changes, particularly those linked to APOBEC3, are thought to contribute to clade 1b’s enhanced transmissibility.\n\nSince its initial identification, this variant has expanded its reach within the DRC to other provinces and has also been reported in neighboring nations like Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya, signifying a considerable geographical expansion of the outbreak \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B14-viruses-17-00753), [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo was the epicenter and reported 3235 Mpox infections and 19 deaths as of 11 August 2024 \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B16-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The emergence of the clade 1b Mpox in neighboring Central and East African countries has raised significant concerns about the potential for a wider regional epidemic. Burundi had recorded 545 Mpox alerts by 17 August 2024, and 142 were confirmed positive for the clade Ib Mpox variant. Rwanda confirmed its initial two Mpox infections on 24 July 2024, prompting the Ministry of Health to declare an outbreak on July 27. By 7 August 2024, Rwanda had reported a total of four confirmed cases of the clade 1b variant of Mpox, with no associated deaths. In Uganda, initially, six suspected cases were identified in June 2024, and out of those six, two were confirmed later. As of 13 August 2024, Kenya has identified 14 suspected cases, with one confirmed positive for clade Ib Mpox. To date, no deaths have been reported.\n\nIn August 2024, the clade 1b strain’s spread beyond Africa was confirmed for the first time \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The virus has also extended its reach to countries in East Africa, Europe, and Asia, underscoring its capacity for worldwide spread \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B16-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Sweden reported a case involving a traveler returning from an affected region, demonstrating the pivotal role of international travel in spreading infectious diseases globally \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B17-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This event prompted urgent calls for governments to enhance border checks, implement targeted surveillance, and foster international collaboration to control cross-border disease transmission. On 22 August 2024, Thailand reported its initial Mpox case of a European man with a recent travel history to Africa \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B18-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Likewise, India’s identification of its first imported clade 1b Mpox case in Kerala highlights the potential for international travel to contribute to the dissemination of this variant.\n\nFrom November 2024 to 12 February 2025, four cases of clade Ib were detected. In the United States, the first confirmed case of clade Ib Mpox occurred in California in November 2024, following travel to an affected region. A second case was identified in Georgia on 14 January 2025, involving a traveler from a country with ongoing Mpox transmission. Subsequent cases were reported in New Hampshire on 7 February 2025 and in New York on 12 February 2025. These four cases represent independent events, with no epidemiological links established and no evidence of further transmission \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B19-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The 2024 outbreak emphasized the importance of aligning travel health policies with robust outbreak management strategies to minimize risks from rapidly spreading pathogens \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B15-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA significant public health crisis unfolded between 2022 and 31 December 2024, with global records documenting over 118,777 Mpox infections \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Between 2022 and 2024, the different regions of the Americas documented 67,220 confirmed Mpox cases, resulting in 151 deaths across 31 countries and territories \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The majority of these cases occurred in 2022 (57,616, representing 85.7% of the total), followed by a substantial decline in 2023 (4056 cases, 6%). A minor increase was observed in 2024, with 5548 cases (8.3%) \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B20-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined that the highly contagious clade 1b strain is the primary driver of this outbreak, characterized by severe symptoms and increased mortality \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B21-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The most affected areas that reported a large number of infections were East, Central, West, and Southern Africa, specifically, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, the Central African Republic (CAR), Ivory Coast, and South Africa \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B22-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The swift dissemination of the virus in these areas underscores the critical need for collaborative containment efforts and enhanced healthcare systems to effectively address such epidemics.\n\n### 1.2. The 2022 Outbreak\n\nBefore 2022, Mpox cases were documented within the African continent. The first case of the 2022 outbreak of the Mpox outside the African continent was recorded on 6 May 2022 in the United Kingdom \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B23-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A total of 366 Mpox cases were confirmed in the United Kingdom (UK) until 10 June 2022 \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B24-viruses-17-00753), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B25-viruses-17-00753)\\]. On 18 May 2022, Portugal reported 14 Mpox infections, Spain reported seven, and Canada reported 13. The first Mpox cases in Belgium, Sweden, and Italy were confirmed on 19 May 2022. France, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands each reported their initial Mpox cases on 20 May 2022. Switzerland and Israel each confirmed their initial Mpox cases on May 21. By 24 May 2022, 19 countries had reported cases of Mpox. Among these, the United Arab Emirates identified its first case in late May, involving a 29-year-old female traveler from West Africa. Slovenia also confirmed its initial infection. Denmark’s first case was linked to an individual returning from the Canary Islands. In Canada, Quebec reported fifteen confirmed cases on 24 May, the same day the Czech Republic confirmed its first case \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B24-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study published in the New England Journal on 21 July 2022 reported a total of 528 Mpox infections between 27 April and 24 June 2022, at 43 sites within 16 countries \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nBy 27 May 2022, Portugal had confirmed 96 Mpox cases, and the information regarding demographics, clinical presentation, and exposure was collected from all 96 cases via face-to-face and telephone interviews using standardized case investigation forms. A subset of 27 confirmed cases underwent more detailed investigation, and their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with available laboratory and epidemiological findings, are summarized in a previous study published in Eurosurveillance in June 2022 \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B27-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The majority of cases (25 cases) of the 2022 Portugal outbreak resided in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) region, with single cases in the North and Algarve regions. All cases were male, ages ranging from 22 to 51 years (majority 30–39). Considering exposures within the 21 days preceding symptom onset, few (1/10) reported contact with individuals exhibiting similar symptoms, and some had a history of international travel (4/27).\n\nMost cases were identified as men who have sex with men (MSM) (18/19), while one reported sex with only women. During the 21 days before symptom onset, most cases with available data (14/16) reported multiple sexual partners. Six cases reported attending a sauna in the LVT region, one frequented a UK sauna, and four reported international travel—three reported contacts with animals (two with cats and one with pigs). Common symptoms included exanthema (fourteen), inguinal lymphadenopathy (fourteen), fever (thirteen), and genital ulcers (six). Fourteen cases were HIV-positive. Three cases required hospitalization, two of whom were later discharged. No deaths were reported by 27 May 2022. One middle-aged case reported prior smallpox vaccination \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B27-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency for a previous Mpox outbreak caused by clade IIb of the virus. Almost 48 cases of Mpox were reported from different regions of Latin America, such as Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, by 28 June 2022 \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B28-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In July 2022, the multi-country Mpox outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to its rapid spread through sexual contact in regions previously unaffected by the virus. This declaration was lifted in May 2023 following a sustained global decline in cases. The outbreak had infected 87,000 people and resulted in 140 deaths. The WHO attributed the successful containment to a combination of vaccination and public health information campaigns \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B29-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Most of these countries have set up their epidemiological centers for the identification of these viruses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 7 February 2024, the maximum number of reported cases in the USA is 31,894, followed by Brazil (10,967), Spain (7752), and France (4171).\n\nThe geographical distribution of the Mpox in countries affected in Africa is illustrated in [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f002) a, while the recent trends of Mpox cases in Africa are shown in [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f002) b.\n\n#### Figure 2.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/d209b4abd20e/viruses-17-00753-g002.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g002.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f002/)\n\n( **a**) Shows the geographical distribution of Mpox in countries affected in Africa.

Brackets at the end of the curve indicate potential reporting delays in recent weeks of data. Figure and data source: WHO.\n\n## 2\\. Host Reservoirs and Transmission\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease; Central African rodents and primates are the natural hosts of Mpox. The Mpox virus is primarily transmitted from animals to humans through close contact, such as bites, scratches, or exposure to the animal’s rash, as well as through exposure to their bodily fluids or consumption of improperly cooked meat \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B30-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Transmission can also occur via contaminated materials (fomites) like bedding or clothing. Historically, human-to-human transmission has been less frequent.\n\nA 2018 case study reported that a man traveling from Nigeria to the UK on September 6th presented with a maculopapular rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy and was subsequently diagnosed with Mpox. One of the three attending healthcare workers developed symptoms, was isolated, and had 134 contacts traced and monitored. Four of these contacts later became ill. This incident demonstrates human-to-human transmission of Mpox from a traveler returning from Nigeria to healthcare staff \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B31-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nHistorically, Mpox infection was primarily linked to animal contact or travel to endemic regions. However, the transmission pattern shifted in the 2022 outbreak, with most cases now attributed to sexual contact. Over the last two years (2020–22), predominantly gay and bisexual men have been affected \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B32-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study reveals that the risk of public transmission was very low because Mpox virus transmission from human to human requires close contact. Human-to-human transmission of the Mpox virus occurred through direct contact through blood transfusion, respiratory droplet infection, sharing of foods, clothes, and bedding, and sexual activity, especially with male-to-male sex \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B33-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe Mpox virus may be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and that type of transmission is called vertical transmission \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B34-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The different proposed model admits that during the entry of the Mpox virus through the respiratory epithelium in humans, the Mpox virus enters dendritic cells and macrophages, which then enter lymphatic vessels and the lymphatic system. In the same way, when the Mpox virus infects the skin epidermis, it first infects fibroblast cells and Langerhans cells, which move in lymphatic vessels and then into the lymphatic system. In this way, it spreads all over the body and infects the liver, which may cause serious liver problems ( [Figure 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f003)).\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n[![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/fd6ca55b0628/viruses-17-00753-g003.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g003.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f003/)\n\nA schematic diagram of the Mpox virus and its entry route in humans was created by biorender.com.

Complications Associated with Mpox\n\nThe various complications that have been observed in Mpox-infected persons are the following.\n\n### 3.1. Neurological and Psychiatric Complications\n\nMpox infections are associated with potential neurological and mental health complications. Research conducted in Nigeria in 2020 indicated that a quarter of hospitalized Mpox patients experienced psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B35-viruses-17-00753)\\]. However, it is difficult to isolate these symptoms from the psychological impact of hospitalization and isolation. Neurological issues, including seizures, confusion, and encephalitis, were observed in Mpox patients during the 2022 outbreak, with reported occurrences of 2.7%, 2.4%, and 2%, respectively \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B36-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed the presence of Mpox-specific IgM antibodies. Studies indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in 50% of individuals with Mpox infection. Badenoch and colleagues suggest that symptoms occur in more than half of cases \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B36-viruses-17-00753)\\]. These symptoms may arise from the infection itself or the experience of quarantine \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B37-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, research conducted in Iraq has revealed widespread anxiety among the general population concerning the ongoing Mpox outbreak \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B38-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This research sought to evaluate public awareness, perceptions, and anxiety related to the multi-country Mpox outbreak within the Kurdistan region of Iraq. A digital survey utilizing a convenience sampling approach was conducted from 27 to 30 July 2022. The study included 510 participants. Overall, the population demonstrated a moderate understanding of Mpox, held a neutral attitude toward it, and experienced a moderate level of anxiety. Statistical analysis revealed that demographic factors, including gender, religion, education level, and place of residence, significantly impacted awareness and anxiety levels. Gender and the residential area also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward Mpox \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B38-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.2. Dermatological Complications\n\nA common characteristic of Mpox infection is the appearance of skin lesions, particularly in the anogenital region. Skin lesions present as a rash that progresses through distinct stages: initially flat (macular), then raised (popular), and subsequently fluid-filled (vesicular). These lesions typically resolve with crusting within three weeks \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B39-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A characteristic Mpox rash begins with small, flat (macules) or raised (papules) lesions, typically 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter. These lesions progress over two to three weeks, evolving into fluid-filled vesicles and pus-filled pustules, often with a central depression (umbilication), and eventually form crusts. The vesicles and pustules themselves are generally spherical, ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and are notable for their firm texture, deep skin involvement, and well-defined edges \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B40-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA hallmark of Mpox is a unique rash characterized by painful or itchy maculopapular lesions that progress into a vesiculopustular eruption \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B41-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Typically, the rash emerges within one to three days following the onset of initial symptoms. However, variations exist, with some individuals experiencing the rash more than three days after fever onset or concurrently with the fever. Lesions commonly manifest on the face, trunk, extremities, genital region, scalp, palms, and soles. The rash often begins on the face and then spreads outward (centrifugally) to the limbs, palms, soles, and mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, and genitals. A higher concentration of lesions is generally observed on the face and limbs \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B42-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In some cases, oral lesions, known as enanthems, may precede the appearance of the skin rash. A comprehensive review of available research indicates that sore throat is the most frequently reported oral symptom of Mpox, while ulceration is the most common oral or peri-oral sign \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B43-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn one study of 54 patients, all presented with skin lesions, with a significant majority (94%) exhibiting anogenital involvement \\[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B44-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A large portion of these patients (89%) reported lesions at multiple anatomical sites, and a smaller percentage (7%) had lesions in the oropharyngeal area. Additionally, a substantial number of patients experienced fatigue (67%) and fever (57%), while a minority (18%) showed no initial symptoms. In some cases, genital ulcers were observed to be painless, accompanied by bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy, resembling the presentation of primary syphilis \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B45-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA separate international study, tracking 528 Mpox infections in 2022, also identified anogenital lesions as a prevalent symptom. This study found that 73% of patients had anogenital lesions, and 41% presented with mucosal lesions. A rash was observed in 95% of patients, with other frequently reported symptoms including fever (62%), lymphadenopathy (56%), lethargy (41%), muscle aches (31%), and headaches (27% \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\]). Due to the varied and evolving clinical presentation of Mpox, especially as seen in the 2022 outbreak, medical professionals, particularly dermatologists, are advised to exercise a high degree of vigilance when evaluating patients with suspected Mpox infection.\n\nThe other study, conducted in 101 patients from thirteen countries, shows that 54% of cases have been found with skin lesions. During the initial five days of infection, papules (36%), vesicles (17%), and pustules (20%) were the most frequently observed skin lesions. From days 6–10, pustules became the dominant lesion (36%), followed by erosions/ulcers (27%) and crusts/scabs (24%). After day 11, crusts/scabs were the primary skin manifestation \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B46-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nWhile monkeypox treatment remains largely symptomatic due to the lack of specific antiviral medications, a novel therapeutic approach combining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) successfully treated a large facial cutaneous lesion, highlighting its potential as a promising intervention \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B47-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.3. Complications Related to the Coinfection of Mpox Virus and HIV\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020, demonstrated the rapid emergence of viral diseases and the potential for global spread, highlighting the ongoing threat of Mpox. Mpox may be more lethal for immunocompromised people, such as those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The coinfection of Mpox virus and HIV was first identified and diagnosed in Latin America \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B48-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In 2022, the recent coinfection of Mpox and acute HIV was also confirmed in a 24-year-old male with outstretched papules throughout the trunk, face, and genital area \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B49-viruses-17-00753)\\]. A 2023 review in _Vaccine_ reported 6345 confirmed Mpox cases across 53 studies, with a 40.32% HIV co-infection rate \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B50-viruses-17-00753)\\]. According to WHO, 51% (13,769/26,992) of confirmed cases of Mpox have HIV \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B51-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The outbreak of Mpox in multiple countries was reported during 2022–24. According to the WHO report, the maximum number of confirmed cases came from the European region (86%), followed by America (11%), the African region (2%), and the Eastern Mediterranean region (1%) \\[ [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B52-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Co-infection with HIV increases the chance of infection in an uninfected person by enhancing the concentration of HIV on genital organs (lesions) and genital secretions or by increasing both factors \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B53-viruses-17-00753), [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B54-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Individuals living with HIV, especially those with compromised immune systems characterized by low CD4 cell counts (<500 cells per mm3), demonstrate an increased vulnerability to severe Mpox complications and mortality compared to those without HIV. The immunodeficiency resulting from advanced HIV infection elevates the susceptibility to severe Mpox manifestations, which can include necrotizing skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, secondary infections, and sepsis \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B55-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThis study analysed 382 Mpox cases, comprising 367 cisgender males, four cisgender females, and ten transgender females. The median age of the participants was 35 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 30 to 43 years. At the time of Mpox diagnosis, 349 individuals (91%) were known to be living with HIV. Among those with HIV, 228 (65%) were adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Concurrent opportunistic infections were observed in 32 participants (8%). The median CD4 cell count was 211 cells/mm3 (IQR 117–291). Specifically, 85 individuals (22%) had CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3, and 94 individuals (25%) had counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3. An undetectable viral load was present in 193 participants (51%) \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B55-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nSevere Mpox complications were significantly more prevalent in individuals with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm3 compared to those with counts exceeding 300 cells/mm3. These complications included the following: necrotizing skin lesions (54% vs. 7%), pulmonary involvement, sometimes with nodules (29% vs. 0%), and secondary infections and sepsis (44% vs. 9%).\n\nHospitalization was required for 107 participants (28%), with 27 (25%) of those hospitalized resulting in death. All fatalities occurred in individuals with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. Within this group, mortality was higher among those with elevated HIV viral loads. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) related to Mpox was suspected in 21 of the 85 individuals (25%) who initiated or restarted ART, with 12 (57%) of these cases resulting in death. Tecovirimat was administered to 62 participants (16%), while cidofovir or brincidofovir was used in seven participants (2%). Tecovirimat resistance was confirmed in three cases.\n\n### 3.4. Complications Associated with Heart (Myocarditis)\n\nMyocarditis, pericarditis, and myopericarditis have been rarely documented in Mpox infection. Two immunocompetent, unvaccinated adults in the U.S. developed monkeypox-related myocarditis. They were hospitalized and presented with cardiac symptoms (Chest pain) and elevated biomarkers. Oral tecovirimat and doxycycline were provided for the treatment of monkeypox, and they were discharged home after recovery without immediate complications. They received no specific treatment for myocarditis, given the rapid resolution of symptoms and normalization of troponin levels \\[ [56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B56-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a 2022 study, Thornhill et al. documented two instances of self-limiting myocarditis associated with monkeypox, where patients recovered within seven days without significant complications. One of these patients had a history of HIV with a normal CD4 count \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B26-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nA wide range of viruses are known to cause myocarditis, such as Coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses \\[ [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B57-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Viral myocarditis can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. The most frequently observed pathological process involves lymphocytic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, typically developing 10 to 14 days after the viral infection. The occurrence of myocardial involvement in orthopoxvirus infections was initially documented following smallpox vaccination in young military recruits, using live vaccinia-based vaccines \\[ [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B58-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The precise pathophysiological pathways leading to orthopox-induced myocarditis remain to be determined. Heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular-related problems may also be possible in Mpox infection \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B59-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.5. Hypotension Sepsis Complication\n\nIn severe cases, significant fluid loss due to fever, rash, and capillary permeability can occur. The associated systemic inflammatory response may also contribute to hypotension. These factors combine to reduce renal perfusion, potentially leading to acute kidney injury. Vigilant monitoring of urine output and blood chemistry is essential for early detection and to guide the necessity of intravenous fluid replacement.\n\nWhile infrequent, secondary bacterial infections leading to sepsis have been documented in Mpox-infected patients with _Streptococcus pyogenes_ \\[ [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B60-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Prompt identification of sepsis, utilizing standard diagnostic criteria, is essential. Treatment should adhere to established sepsis management protocols, including initiating broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics within one hour of diagnosis, rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation with ongoing response evaluation, vasoactive medication administration, and appropriate respiratory support \\[ [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B61-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.6. Ocular Complication\n\nOcular symptoms are uncommon but can cause corneal scarring and vision loss \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B3-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Manifestations, potentially from self-inoculation, include conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and other ocular inflammations. The 2022 Mpox outbreak showed a significantly lower ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, compared to 9–23% in prior outbreaks \\[ [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B62-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox can present with a variety of ocular symptoms, including redness, frontal headaches, rashes around the eyes, tearing, discharge, and subconjunctival nodules. Less commonly, it may lead to more severe complications like keratitis, corneal ulcers, opacification, perforation, and vision loss. In the 2022 outbreak, these ocular symptoms have been observed less often and potentially with reduced severity. Though potential underreporting exists, observational studies suggest an ocular involvement rate of approximately 1%, significantly lower than the 9–23% incidence reported in previous outbreaks in endemic regions \\[ [62](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B62-viruses-17-00753), [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B63-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Newborns have been reported to experience ocular involvement with Mpox \\[ [64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B64-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Additionally, there are documented cases (53-year-old patient in San Francisco, CA, USA) where ocular symptoms presented independently, without concurrent skin lesions \\[ [65](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B65-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nPatients presenting with ocular Mpox symptoms should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. A slit-lamp examination and dilated fundoscopy are valuable tools for assessing the involvement of both anterior and posterior eye structures \\[ [66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B66-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nRetinol supplementation is advised. Supportive measures such as eye lubrication and saline compresses may provide relief. In cases of co-infection, ophthalmic antibiotics or antivirals may be necessary \\[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B67-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Patients should be instructed to avoid contact lens use \\[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B68-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Topical trifluridine, under ophthalmological guidance, can be considered for conjunctivitis and is recommended for keratitis management.\n\n### 3.7. Fulminant Mpox\n\nA severe, widespread, and destructive form of Mpox has been observed in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, such as those with CD4 counts below 100 cells/µL, high HIV viral loads, or hepatitis B co-infection. These cases show a resemblance to an AIDS-defining illness. Patients showed extensive, large necrotic skin and mucosal lesions that often merged \\[ [69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B69-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Severe secondary bacterial infections were frequent. Complications included lung nodules, necrotic pulmonary masses, nodular hepatic lesions, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B70-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) was suspected in a quarter of patients initiating or resuming antiretroviral therapy post-diagnosis \\[ [71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B71-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mortality was reported in 15% of patients, primarily those with CD4 counts below 200 cells/µL \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B70-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn moderately to severely immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled viral dissemination, optimal immune function should be prioritized. Tecovirimat should be initiated promptly, and consider adding cidofovir or brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin. Prolonged treatment may be necessary. Wound care is essential, and fluid management may be required. Specialist consultation should be considered as needed. Close monitoring for complications is vital \\[ [72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B72-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n### 3.8. Complications Associated with Immune System\n\nLike COVID-19 infection, Mpox also creates cytokines inside the body \\[ [73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B73-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Cytokines are Th2-mediated, and a large number of interleukins (IL-4, IL5, IL6, and IL10) are released, while TH1-mediated cytokines are released in a lower amount. Therefore, IFγ (interferon gamma), IL2, IL12, TNF-α, and IFN-α levels decreased after Mpox infection \\[ [74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B74-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The human Mpox virus causes post-translational modification on the host cell. It downregulates those regulatory factors that increase histone expression while upregulating core histone proteins. The nucleosome formation of viruses depends on host nucleosome modification \\[ [75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B75-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox has a specific mechanism through which it defends itself via the immune reaction of the host. The intracellular protein of Mpox called Viro transducer stops apoptosis in the host cell and stops the host cell from responding against the virus \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B33-viruses-17-00753), [76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B76-viruses-17-00753)\\]. In this way, these proteins evade the host’s immune system to allow for viral replication in the host, as shown in [Figure 4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#viruses-17-00753-f004). The Mpox virus uses various strategies in the host cell to escape from the host immune defense system. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and is operated by interferons (IFNs) \\[ [77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B77-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Interferons prevent viral replication in host cells using direct or indirect pathways. There are three types of interferons: type 1, type 2, and type 3. IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNω are considered type I interferons. Type I interferons create antiviral activity in cells by activating Janus protein tyrosine kinase and signal transducers and activators of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway \\[ [78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B78-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Mpox virus evades the immune response of the host in the following way: (a) An in vitro study in 2010 showed that Mpox viral protein B16 inhibits JAK-STAT induced by type I interferon \\[ [79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B79-viruses-17-00753)\\]. (b) Another experiment performed in mice in 2004 found that homologs of D7L block interleukin (IL-18) \\[ [80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B80-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The complement control protein (CCP) of Mpox inhibits the complement activation pathway, which is a key factor for viral defense \\[ [81](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B81-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Apart from it, many proteins of Mpox are responsible for evasion, including ankyrin-like protein, viral growth factor, IL-18 binding protein, apoptosis inhibitors, SPI-1, inhibitors of MHC class I molecules, inhibitors of IRF3 NF-kB activation, Inhibitor of IRF3 and IRF7 activation, inhibitors of MHC class II, CC, and CXC chemokine binding proteins.\n\n#### Figure 4.\n\n[![Figure 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4b7e/12197743/4ace5344de38/viruses-17-00753-g004.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12197743_viruses-17-00753-g004.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/figure/viruses-17-00753-f004/)\n\nThe schematic diagram shows an Mpox-infected liver and testis and its evading mechanism in host cells with cytokine storm production, representing increased Th2-mediated immune response and decreased TH1-mediated immune response.\n\n## 4\\. Diagnosis of Mpox\n\nPCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a gold standard molecular biology technique that detects the presence of Mpox viral DNA in samples such as blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific method used for confirmatory diagnosis. Real-time PCR is the most common diagnostic procedure for the detection of Mpox. In the 2022–23 outbreak of Mpox, four novel molecular kits were used: The Novaplex MPXV Assay, the STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX, the Real Cycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2, and the RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0, with an in-house PCR assay. A comparison study of diagnostic kits shows that sensitivity and specificity were 100% for the Novaplex MPXV Assay and RealStar Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit 1.0. The RealCycler MONK-UX/MONK-GX v.2 and STANDARD M10 MPX/OPX exhibited a slight decrease in the accuracy (97.3%) and diagnostic sensitivity (96.3%) \\[ [82](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B82-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe lab diagnosis of viral infections plays a crucial role in the detection of diseases and their treatment. Cell culture or tissue culture is considered to be the standard method for the isolation and cultivation of viruses, although this method is considered to be time-consuming and has a high risk of contamination \\[ [83](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B83-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The other standard methods for the detection of viruses are molecular and non-molecular techniques (immunofluorescence technique and ELISA), electron microscopy-based detection (TEM), radiation-based virus detection (X-ray diffraction technique and CT), nucleic acid amplification methods (NASBA, LAMP, RT-PCR), antigen-antibody complex-mediated detection of viruses (HAI), and CRISPR-CAS system-based detection \\[ [84](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B84-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Urine, saliva, semen, and rectal or genital samples can also be taken for investigative purposes, depending on the clinic \\[ [85](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B85-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nCRISPR-based detection is also a rising diagnostic method in the field of virology. According to research conducted \\[ [86](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B86-viruses-17-00753)\\], a system was designed to detect the Mpox viral DNA using a fluorescence readout. In this study, it was shown that the G-quadruplex oligonucleotide of the target DNA, which was labeled with fluorescein (6-FAM) on the 3-prime end and black hole 1-quencher (BHQ-1) at the 5-prime end, produced a fluorescence signal when it was degraded via the CAS-12a-mediated collateral cleavage. This effect was not shown in the absence of the target DNA because CAS-12a is unable to cleave the labeled G-quadruplex oligonucleotide, and fluorescence quenching happens.\n\nPan-orthopoxvirus PCR/ESI-MS is another emerging method in the field of diagnostics; it can perform identification of all members of orthomyxovirus without sequencing by using the T5000 platform \\[ [87](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B87-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Here, A PCR method coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) was employed to diagnose Mpox in spiked human samples and aerosol-infected cynomolgus macaque samples.\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is another molecular diagnostic technique used in virology, offering a potential alternative to RT-PCR. This technique uses the displacement of the auto-cycling step of DNA synthesis by Bst DNA polymerase, which replicates the gene without the use of a light cycle \\[ [88](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B88-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n## 5\\. Treatment of Mpox\n\nThe treatment of Mpox primarily focuses on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The symptoms, like fever, pain, and itching, can be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Antiviral medication such as tecovirimat has been used for some patients with Mpox, particularly those with severe illness or who are at high risk of complications. Other antiviral medications, such as brincidofovir and cidofovir, may be considered in certain situations, but their use is generally limited. Vaccines are also recommended for people at high risk of exposure. To prevent infection with the Mpox virus, avoid close skin contact and contact with contaminated materials (e.g., clothing, bedding). Most people with Mpox experience mild symptoms and recover without specific treatment. Severe cases and complications are more common in individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women.\n\n### 5.1. Vaccine Strategies Against Mpox\n\nAlmost a thousand cases have been reported from different parts of the world since April 2022, mostly from non-endemic countries; therefore, it has become necessary to understand the possible risk factors associated with this virus. Viral inactivation is a crucial step to prevent the spreading of Mpox; among the methods of viral inactivation, heat inactivation is one of the methods of viral inactivation.\n\nAccording to Batéjat Christophe et al., the Mpox virus was inoculated on two growth media named FCS and VTM and then subjected to heat inactivation at different temperatures over a period. This study showed that Mpox got inactivated in less than 5 min if heated at 70 °C and less than 15 min if heated at 60 °C, and there was no difference between clade I and clade II \\[ [89](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B89-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe United States of America currently has three vaccines against smallpox: JYNNEOSTM, also known as IMVAMUNE, ACAM2000®, and Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine (APSV) \\[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B90-viruses-17-00753)\\]. This vaccine JYNNEOSTM has been prepared from the modified Ortho poxvirus vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic strain and is attenuated in nature and non-replicating.\n\nIn August 2007, the FDA approved ACAM2000® for the prevention of smallpox. The ACAM2000® vaccine is also a live vaccine but shows some differences with JYNNEOS™. ACAM2000® is a replication-competent vaccinia virus, whereas JYNNEOS™ is a replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus. ACAM2000® shows some major cutaneous reactions, but JYNNEOS™ does not show cutaneous reactions. Under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV) can be used, but its effectiveness against Mpox is still unknown \\[ [90](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B90-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nThe FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the use of the JYNNEOS™ vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and Mpox \\[ [91](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B91-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Originally, the FDA developed these vaccines for the subcutaneous route in a two-dose series (0.5 mL per dose, administered 4 weeks apart). However, due to overwhelming demand, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) on 9 August 2022 for the intradermal route in a two-dose series (0.1 mL per dose, administered four weeks apart).\n\nIt was also found that full vaccination with the vaccine through subcutaneous, intradermal, and heterologous routes had an adjusted VE of 88.9% (95% CL, 56.0 to 97.2), 80.3% (95% CL, 22.9 to 95.0), and 86.9% (95% CL, 69.1 to 94.5), respectively. These vaccines are administered to persons who are either suffering from Mpox or have been previously exposed to such patients of Mpox. These vaccines (JYNNEOS™) are also offered to persons who are at high risk of getting infected by Mpox, such as gay, bisexual, MSM, transgender, non-binary, or gender non-conforming persons and HIV patients \\[ [92](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B92-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nHuber et al. have shown the effectiveness of the vaccine on patients suffering from Mpox and others with MSM (men who have sex with another man), aged 18–49. A total of 309 infected patients (Mpox or MSM) were included in this study and found that the adjusted vaccine efficiency (VE) was 75.2% (95% confidence interval (CL) 61.2 to 84.2) in patients with a single dose (partial vaccination) of vaccine and 85.9% (95% CL, 73.8 to 92.4) in patients with full (two doses) vaccination \\[ [93](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B93-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nLauren Pischel quantified the vaccine efficacy of third-generation Mpox vaccines (MVA-BN, LC16m8, OrthopoxVac) in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death among the global population \\[ [94](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B94-viruses-17-00753)\\]. They compared vaccinated individuals to those unvaccinated or vaccinated with other vaccines. Additionally, they analyzed vaccine efficacy based on the number of vaccine doses (one or two) and whether the vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). A comprehensive literature search yielded 11,892 initial records, with an additional 3223 identified through citation tracking. Thirty-three studies focused on third-generation Mpox vaccines, predominantly MVA-BN (32 studies). Two additional studies reanalysed existing data. The majority of these studies cantered on gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men aged 18–49, conducted between May and October 2022.\n\nVaccine efficacy for a single dose of MVA-BN was estimated at 76% (95% CI: 64–88%) across twelve studies. For two doses, the vaccine efficacy was calculated at 82% (95% CI: 72–92%) based on six studies. Regarding post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with MVA-BN, the vaccine efficacy against Mpox was 20% (95% CI: -24–65%) from seven studies. All vaccine efficacy estimates were derived from random-effects meta-analysis.\n\nIn terms of study quality, 18 out of 33 (55%) were rated as poor, 3 out of 33 (9%) as fair, and 12 out of 33 (36%) as good. Notably, studies included in the meta-analysis generally exhibited higher quality, with 11 out of 16 (69%) rated as good.\n\n### 5.2. Various Therapies for the Management of Mpox\n\n#### 5.2.1. Tecovirimat\n\nTecovirimat (TPOXX, ST-246) is generally used to treat smallpox, as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but under the Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol, it can also be used to treat Mpox. In the United States or Canada, Tecovirimat is not approved for use against Mpox, although tecovirimat is now approved in Europe for the treatment of Mpox \\[ [95](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B95-viruses-17-00753), [96](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B96-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Various clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of tecovirimat, but it is not clear.\n\nTecovirimat is a small molecule virus inhibitor with strong activity against Mpox and other smallpox viruses. Tecovirimat’s mechanism involves targeting the highly conserved orthopoxvirus F13L protein. This protein is essential for the creation of enveloped virions, which are necessary for viral spread. Tecovirimat functions by acting as a molecular binder, promoting the dimerization of F13L and thereby inhibiting its normal activity \\[ [97](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B97-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nEarly studies have indicated that tecovirimat did not significantly shorten the duration of monkeypox skin lesions \\[ [98](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B98-viruses-17-00753), [99](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B99-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Initial findings from the STOMP trial, which spanned multiple countries, failed to demonstrate a notable impact of tecovirimat on the healing time of skin and mucosal lesions in individuals with mild to moderate monkeypox. Notably, in the STOMP trial, a majority of participants began tecovirimat treatment more than five days after experiencing initial symptoms \\[ [100](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B100-viruses-17-00753)\\]. According to another study \\[ [101](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B101-viruses-17-00753)\\], tecovirimat, which inhibits the formation of p37 (a protein that helps in the release of enveloped virus and also enhances the virulence factor), was found to be effective in treating Mpox.\n\nTecovirimat is an inhibitor of the pox virus; however, Mpox also shows resistance against many drugs in cell culture, including CMX001 and ST-246 \\[ [102](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B102-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The clinical study of Mpox was done in France in 2022, where Mpox was isolated and sequenced. This study reveals that the effective concentration of tecovirimat against Mpox is in nanomolar concentrations, while cidofovir is only effective at micromolar concentrations \\[ [103](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B103-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Therefore, combination therapy may be effective for the treatment of Mpox.\n\nThe efficacy of tecovirimat has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo against a clade 2 Canadian 2022 isolate of Mpox isolated during the 2022 outbreak, and it was found that tecovirimat prevented Mpox replication in vitro with an effective concentration in the nanomolar range. The efficacy of tecovirimat was also evaluated in the CAST/EiJ mouse model with the 2022 Canadian isolate. The experiments also show that tecovirimat reduced viral titers after 1–2 weeks of infection. In 2022, tecovirimat was recommended against Mpox treatment. In vitro testing has been performed against 2022 Canadian isolates of Mpox designated Mpox/SP2833. The EC50 and EC90, for TPOXX were determined against Mpox/SP2833, a clade 1 virus in Vero E6 cells is 0.008 ± 0.0014 (EC50 value (μM) ± SE) and 0.0145 ± 0.0138 (EC90 value (μM) ± SE) \\[ [104](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B104-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a recent study published in the Lancet journal in 2025, the author conducted an in vitro analysis comparing the susceptibility of clades 1b and 2b to tecovirimat. The clade 1b isolate was obtained in Sweden in August 2024 from a traveler returning from Africa. For comparison, the clade 2b virus was isolated in France in June 2022 from a patient at the Institut Pasteur Medical Center. Additionally, ancestral clades 1a and 2a were included as controls, utilizing U2OS cells, known for their high sensitivity to Mpox virus infection, as target cells. The findings demonstrated that tecovirimat effectively suppressed all four viral strains, exhibiting comparable half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 15.3 nM to 25.8 Nm \\[ [105](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B105-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n#### 5.2.2. Cidofovir and Brincidofovir\n\nBrincidofovir and cidofovir are also being used as DNA polymerase inhibitors for Mpox treatment, despite not being approved by the FDA. In vitro and in vivo studies reported that both cidofovir and brincidofovir can stop the replication of Mpox \\[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B106-viruses-17-00753)\\]. When Brin cidofovir derivative (CMX001) is given to the host, the lipid part of the drug breaks down and releases cidofovir, which forms cidofovir-diphosphate after phosphorylation, which inhibits DNA polymerase \\[ [107](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B107-viruses-17-00753), [108](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B108-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nIn a 2020 study, another new drug was reported, which is Nioch-14, having antiviral activity against Mpox \\[ [106](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B106-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\n#### 5.2.3. Resveratrol\n\nA recent study indicated that resveratrol plays an important role in Mpox treatment. Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol found in grapes, peanuts, pines, and berries \\[ [109](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B109-viruses-17-00753), [110](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B110-viruses-17-00753)\\]. It is also available in red and white wines, but a higher concentration is found in red wine. The maximum amount of resveratrol is found in Polygonum cuspidatum (524 μg/g). It is also known as Japanese knotweed, which has been extensively used for inflammatory treatments in 2012–13. Resveratrol is found in cis and trans forms, but the trans form is highly effective in anti-inflammatory activity. The antiviral effects of resveratrol have been explored in several viruses, including the Mpox virus, the influenza A virus \\[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B111-viruses-17-00753)\\] Epstein–Barr virus \\[ [112](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B112-viruses-17-00753)\\], Herpes simplex virus \\[ [113](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B113-viruses-17-00753)\\], HIV \\[ [114](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B114-viruses-17-00753)\\], and hepatitis C virus \\[ [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B115-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nResveratrol inhibits the replication of many viruses \\[ [111](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B111-viruses-17-00753), [115](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B115-viruses-17-00753), [116](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B116-viruses-17-00753), [117](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B117-viruses-17-00753), [118](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B118-viruses-17-00753), [119](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B119-viruses-17-00753), [120](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B120-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The antiviral mechanisms of resveratrol against various types of viruses are different. Resveratrol reduced the virus yield by more than 120-fold at a concentration of 50 mM. The effect of resveratrol against Mpox has also been examined using HeLa cells. HeLa cells were infected with two strains of Mpox virus, Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC, and it was found that resveratrol at 50 mM concentration reduced the yield of Mpox-WA and Mpox-ROC Clades by 195- and 38-fold, respectively \\[ [121](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B121-viruses-17-00753)\\].\n\nApart from these potential therapies, some other alternative treatments such as TOP1 inhibitor, chlorhexidine, and cysteine proteinase inhibitors are being explored, but more investigation is required for the effective treatment of these compounds.\n\n#### 5.2.4. Plant Metabolite as a Therapeutic Drug\n\nA recent study was conducted in 2023, in which the anti-monkeypox capability was evaluated in 56 plant products. Among these metabolites, curcumin showed the strongest binding affinity with a value of −37.43 kcal/mol, followed by gedunin (−34.89 kcal/mol), piperine (−34.58 kcal/mol), and coumadin (−34.14 kcal/mol) \\[ [122](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B122-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The study that occurred in 2022 shows various natural compounds obtained from Plantago lanceolate targeting on profilin-like protein A42R of Mpox virus \\[ [123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B123-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The A42R protein of Mpox has an amino acid sequence similarity with profilin proteins of eukaryotic cells \\[ [124](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B124-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Profilin family proteins are actin-binding proteins responsible for F-actin assembly in the actin filament and also participate in the regulation of F-actin \\[ [125](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B125-viruses-17-00753)\\]. Silico-based screening identified various important compounds, such as luteolin 7,30-diglucuronide, luteolin 7-glucuronide-30-glucoside, plantagoside, narcissoside, and others \\[ [123](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12197743/#B123-viruses-17-00753)\\]. The molecular dynamics simulation and post-simulation analysis revealed that plantagoside and narcissoside were found to be more stable products that were able to bind with the binding pocket of the viral protein of the Mpox virus due to hydrophobic and hydrogen interactions.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions\n\nMpox, while historically less prevalent than other orthopoxviruses, has demonstrated a significant emergence for globally, highlighting the importance of robust surveillance and preparedness. Its complications, while often self-limiting, can be severe, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. Transmission, primarily through close contact, necessitates stringent public health measures to curtail outbreaks. Accurate and timely diagnosis, facilitated by PCR testing, is crucial for effective management and containment. While specific antiviral treatments are available, their accessibility and widespread use remain limited, emphasizing the need for further research and development. Effective public health strategies, including vaccination and education, are essential in mitigating the impact of Mpox and preventing future pandemics. Continued research into the virus’s evolving epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and optimal treatment strategies is imperative to safeguard global health.\n\nThe 2019 coronavirus pandemic demonstrated that disease outbreaks extend beyond physical illness, significantly affecting mental well-being. Individuals experienced heightened fear, including anxiety about potential loss and depression linked to isolation. Healthcare workers facing direct exposure reported particularly elevated levels of fear. Parallels can be drawn with the Mpox outbreak, which has also been associated with notable economic and behavioral shifts, manifesting in increased anger, frustration, depression, and anxiety.\n\nThe health care provider also has very little knowledge regarding the treatment of Mpox, so proper guidance and care of Mpox-affected people should be done for the management of mental health issues in COVID-19-affected people, WHO issued advisories that may be implemented in Mpox cases.\n\nThe important suggestions to control mental disorders during the monkeypox outbreak are as follows: (a) Always study and gain knowledge from an authorized source, such as WHO. (b) Do not come under the influence of people who are already suffering from any mental disorder because of an outbreak. (c) Avoid drinking alcohol or smoking during an outbreak because it will only ruin your health condition. (d) Hand hygiene practices should be followed regularly. (e) Eat a well-balanced diet, and try to avoid sitting alone. Even when you are alone in the house, try to chat with your friends or family members via social media. (f) Exercise daily.\n\nThe outbreaks in 2022 across the globe have emphasized the significance of continuous and focused intensive care, along with the development of novel drugs.\n\nThe limited smallpox vaccine administration and decreasing immunity in the population can enhance virus spreading globally. Patients of Mpox have different kinds of complications, such as bacterial infection of the skin, skin scarring, permanent corneal scarring, pneumonia, dehydration, sepsis, and encephalitis. It is imperative to provide comprehensive care for patients, including education, nutritional support, hydration, and protection of sensitive organs such as the eyes and genitals. Therefore, it is important for the medical professional team, including clinicians, health experts, and nurses, to immediately identify infection in humans and animals, use protective measures, and initiate public health reporting to prevent an outbreak.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sharda University and Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU) for providing valuable resources for this work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization and original draft preparation: R.Y., U.S. and S.K.; writing: R.Y., U.S., S.G., H.A.R., A.A.C., S.R. and V.K.K.; review and editing: H.A.R., A.A.C. and S.R.; supervision: S.K., V.K.K. and R.Y.

These cases were not linked to each other and there has been no additional spread.\n- The CDC has assessed the overall risk to the United States from the clade I mpox outbreak as low.\n\n## Clinical Recommendations\n\n- The [CDC recommends](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) that clinicians maintain a greater index of suspicion for mpox infection in patients who have recently traveled to the DRC or neighboring countries who present with [signs and symptoms of mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/clinical-recognition.html).\n- Symptoms can include a rash on the hands, feet, chest, face, mouth, or genital area, fever, chills, fatigue, myalgia, headache, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, nasal congestion, and cough.\n- The [mpox rash](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-signs/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/clinical-recognition.html) commonly involves macules, papules, vesicles or pustules that are deep seated, firm or rubbery, and well circumscribed. Lesions may umbilicate or become confluent and progress over time to scabs.\n- [Ocular manifestations of mpox infection](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/clinical-care/ocular-infection.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/ocular-infection.html) can range from mild to severe and include periocular skin lesions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, and loss of vision.\n- The CDC has also asked clinicians to [document patients' experience with pain](https://www.aao.org/Assets/9a68bbfc-3640-4d6b-a36d-0a0cd640414c/637949550078200000/dear-colleague-monkeypox100-pdf?inline=1) associated with mpox infection.\n- As soon as mpox is suspected, clinicians should consult their [state health department](https://resources.cste.org/epiafterhours) or the CDC through the CDC Emergency Operations Center (770.488.7100).\n\n## Additional

Disease information\n\n# Factsheet for health professionals on mpox\n\nFactsheet\n\n\n**Last reviewed/updated:** 8 October 2024\n\n_**Disclaimer:** The information contained in this factsheet is intended for the purpose of general information and should not substitute individual expert advice or judgement of healthcare professionals. The sections labelled \"Last updated on 8 October 2024\" have been changed since the last version from 28 August 2024. The remaining sections have been reviewed but no changes have been made._\n\nHuman mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) is a zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) \\[1,2\\]. The disease is endemic in some regions of Central and West Africa. The first outbreak of mpox reported outside of Africa \\[3,4\\] was linked to an importation of infected mammals to the United States (US) in 2003.\n\nIn 2022, a large outbreak of mpox was identified for the first time in many previously non-endemic countries worldwide, including EU/EEA countries. The outbreak was driven by human-to-human MPXV transmission via close contact with infected individuals. In the EU/EEA, where low-level circulation of MPXV clade II continues, the majority of cases have been among men who have sex with men.\n\nIn August 2024, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared public health emergencies over a large epidemic of MPXV clade I in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and several other African countries.\n\n## The pathogen\n\nThe monkeypox virus ( _Orthopoxvirus monkeypox_) is an enveloped virus with a double‐stranded DNA genome that belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family. The Orthopoxvirus genus also includes vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, variola virus, and several other animal pathogen poxviruses \\[5\\]. There are two genetically distinct clades described for MPXV: clade I, formerly called the Congo Basin (Central African) clade, with sub-clades Ia and Ib \\[6\\], and clade II, formerly called the West African clade, with sub-clades IIa and IIb \\[7,8\\]. Genetic differences between the viral genomes of the two clades might explain differences in viral clearance and pathogenesis \\[7,9,10\\]. Clade I has been associated with more severe disease and higher mortality \\[2,3,11,12\\].\n\nPoxviruses show extraordinary resistance to drying \\[13\\], and a higher temperature and pH tolerance compared to other enveloped viruses. These characteristics strongly impact their environmental persistence. Viruses of the Orthopoxvirus genus are known to have long-lasting stability in the environment \\[14\\], and viable MPXV can be detected on household surfaces at least 15 days after contamination of the surfaces \\[15\\]. Vaccinia virus (the virus contained in the smallpox vaccine) is rapidly inactivated in sewage \\[16\\]. Despite these characteristics, poxviruses are sensitive to common disinfectants. However, they can be less sensitive to organic disinfectants compared to other enveloped viruses.\n\n## Clinical features and sequelae\n\n_Last updated on 8 October 2024_\n\nBased on studies in Central and West Africa, the incubation period for mpox is described as usually lasting from six to 13 days, but can also range from five to 21 days \\[17\\]. Human mpox often begins with a combination of the following symptoms: fever, headache, chills, exhaustion, asthenia, lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy), back pain, and muscle aches \\[12,18\\]. In cases in endemic areas (Africa), a centrifugal maculopapular rash starts from the site of the primary infection within three days after the onset of prodromal symptoms. It rapidly spreads to other parts of the body and progresses to develop vesicles. Palms and soles are involved in cases of the disseminated rash, which are characteristic of the disease. The number of lesions may range from a few to thousands \\[19\\], and an increasing number of lesions is correlated with increased disease severity.\n\nThe majority of human mpox cases experience mild to moderate symptoms, typically lasting from two to four weeks, followed by complete recovery with supportive care \\[17\\]. The disease severity may vary depending on the virus strain, transmission route, host susceptibility, and the quantity of virus inoculated \\[11\\], with invasive modes of exposure causing more severe disease while having a shorter incubation period \\[20\\].\n\nComplications can include encephalitis, secondary bacterial skin infections, dehydration, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and pneumonia. The case-fatality ratio (CFR) of mpox ranges from 0–11% in outbreaks in endemic areas, with mortality mostly affecting young children \\[17\\]. People living in or near tropical forested areas may have indirect or low-level exposure to infected animals, possibly leading to subclinical (asymptomatic) infection \\[17,21\\]. In endemic areas, immunocompromised individuals were reported to be particularly at risk of severe disease \\[22\\]. In an outbreak in Nigeria in 2017, patients with concurrent HIV infection had more severe disease with more skin lesions and associated genital ulcers compared to HIV-negative individuals, although no deaths were reported \\[23\\].\n\nInformation on clinical features in the ongoing clade I outbreak is still emerging, but reports suggest that among cases exposed through sexual contact in DRC, some individuals only present with genital lesions, rather than the more typical extensive rash \\[24\\].\n\n### Clinical features and sequelae related to the clade II worldwide mpox outbreak starting in 2022\n\n_Last updated on 8 October 2024_\n\nStudies on the multi-country MPXV clade II outbreak which started in May 2022 showed an incubation period of 7–8 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5–10)\\[25-29\\]. Shorter incubation periods of 2–4 days were also observed, possibly due to direct viral inoculation via sexual transmission\\[27,30-32\\]. Data from a contact tracing study in the United Kingdom (UK) which was used to estimate the distribution of incubation periods, showed that 95% of people with potential infection would manifest symptoms within 16–23 days \\[33\\].\n\nAdditionally, a clinical presentation of symptoms which is somewhat different than those previously reported in endemic areas, has also arisen. In the 2022 outbreak, systemic prodromal symptoms started after the rash in up to half of the cases, while they were completely absent in others. Systemic prodromal symptoms included fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache \\[25,32,34,35\\].\n\nIn the 2022 outbreak, most patients presented with fewer than 20 lesions. Cases with more than a hundred lesions were rare \\[32\\]. Lesions on the oral mucosa (enanthem) or ophthalmic mucosa were also present. Clinical manifestations in travel-related cases previously detected in Western countries have usually been mild, sometimes with very few lesions \\[36\\]. A majority of the cases presented with lesions in the anogenital and perioral regions, as well as lymphadenopathy in the catchment area of the lesions \\[32,37,38\\]. However, in some cases, the number of lesions were quite limited, including cases of single cutaneous or mucosal anogenital or oral lesions \\[27\\]. Patients may also have presented with proctitis. Oropharyngeal involvement also occurred, which included oral lesions, tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess causing pain and difficulty in swallowing, and epiglottitis affecting breathing \\[32,35\\].\n\nThe lesions progressed from the stage of macules to papules, vesicles, pseudo-pustules containing solid debris, crusts, and finally scabs, before falling off within 7–14 days \\[39\\]. In the 2022 outbreak, lesions were found to present at different stages in the same patient, although lesions in the same area typically appeared and evolved simultaneously. Not all lesions progressed from one phase to the next in order \\[32\\]. The lesions were deep-seated, may have been centrally depressed (umbilicated), and could have been accompanied by pruritus and/or pain. Scratching may have facilitated secondary bacterial infections.\n\nA minority of cases (1–13%) were hospitalised for isolation, pain management, or for complications such as secondary skin infections, abscesses, and difficulty in swallowing \\[32,35,38,40\\]. Less severe but more common complications included rectal pain, swelling of the penis, and secondary bacterial infections \\[32\\]. Serious complications were rare and included epiglottitis, myocarditis, and encephalitis \\[27\\]. Sporadic fatal cases were reported \\[41\\] and the overall CFR in the 2022 outbreak was less than 0.1% \\[32\\].\n\nIn the 2022 outbreak, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) accounted for 38–50% of mpox cases worldwide \\[32\\]. Several studies have shown no difference in clinical presentation between HIV-positive and HIV-negative mpox cases in this outbreak, but these patients were mostly PLWHA with viral suppression and high CD4 cell counts \\[25,32,42\\]. However, in PLWHA with CD4 cell counts of <100 cells per mm³, severe complications were more common than in those with CD4 cell counts between 300 and 350 cells per mm³, including necrotising skin lesions, lung involvement and secondary infections with sepsis \\[40\\]. A 15% case fatality rate was described among individuals with advanced HIV-related disease characterised by CD4 cell counts below 200 cells per mm3 \\[40\\]. An immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) to mpox was suspected in 21 (25%) out of 85 people who were initiated or re-initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART), of whom 57% died.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\n_Last updated on 8 October 2024_\n\nMpoxis regarded as the most significant orthopoxvirus infection affecting humans since the eradication of smallpox \\[43\\]. MPXV was first isolated in 1958 from pox lesions during an outbreak of vesicular disease among captive cynomolgus macaques _(Macaca fascicularis)_ imported from Singapore into Denmark for polio-vaccine-related research \\[22\\].\n\nAlthough the previous name of the disease (monkeypox) suggested that monkeys are the primary host, the specific animal reservoir of MPXV remains unknown \\[22\\]. In nature, many animal species were found to be infected with MPXV, including rope and tree species of squirrels, Gambian pouched rats ( _Cricetomys gambianus_), striped mice, dormice, and primates \\[1\\]. Some evidence suggests that native African rodents such as Gambian pouched rats and rope squirrels might be a natural reservoir of the virus \\[4,44\\].\n\nThe first detection of MPXV in a human was in 1970 in the equatorial region of DRC, nine months after the eradication of smallpox in that country \\[45\\]. Subsequently, sporadic cases were reported from the rainforest areas of Central and West Africa. Large outbreaks were also identified, mainly in DRC, where the disease is currently considered endemic \\[45,46\\].\n\nFollowing the declaration of the eradication of smallpox in 1980 by the World Health Assembly, the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored enhanced mpox surveillance efforts in the central regions of DRC, for which some limited animal and human ecological studies were undertaken \\[3\\]. This led to a major increase in the reported incidence of mpox.\n\nHuman mpox was first reported outside of Africa in 2003, when an mpox outbreak occurred in the US \\[47,48\\]. A total of 81 human cases of mpox in several states were reported among people who had close contacts with pet prairie dogs; the prairie dogs had been housed with MPXV-infected rodents imported from Ghana. No human-to-human transmission was identified, and no deaths among humans were reported. Following this outbreak, there was no evidence that the virus became enzootic in wildlife in the US.\n\nWhile the majority of documented cases of mpox in Africa have occurred in DRC, the number of cases in other West and Central African countries have also increased in the last decade \\[1\\]. This increase may be partly attributable to decreasing herd immunity in the populations following the cessation of the smallpox vaccination programme in the early 1980s. Other explanatory factors may be changes in the virus itself and modifications to the ecosystems that may have caused the population density of the natural reservoirs to rise \\[45\\] and led to more frequent human-wildlife interactions. Between 2016 and 2022, confirmed cases of mpox have been reported from the following African countries: Cameroon (clade II) \\[49\\], Central African Republic (clade I), DRC (clade I), Liberia (clade II), Nigeria (clade II), Congo (Brazzaville) (clade I), and Sierra Leone (clade II) \\[1,50-52\\]. Prior to 2022, sporadic imported cases of mpox were reported in countries outside of Africa, all having travelled from Nigeria: the UK \\[53-55\\], Israel \\[56\\], and Singapore \\[57,58\\]. In 2021, the UK reported one family cluster: the primary case had been exposed in Nigeria and subsequently infected his family members in the UK\\[59,60\\].\n\nIn May 2022, a multi-country outbreak of mpox was declared, with all EU/EEA countries (except for Liechtenstein) eventually reporting locally acquired cases. The outbreak was driven by human-to-human MPXV transmission via close contact with infected individuals. The majority of cases were men-who-have-sex-with-men. More information about the 2022 outbreak in Europe is available in the [Joint ECDC-WHO Regional Office for Europe Mpox Surveillance Bulletin](https://monkeypoxreport.ecdc.europa.eu/ \"(opens in a new window)\") \\[41\\].\n\nIn September 2023, an outbreak of mpox of the (then new) sub-clade Ib was detected in the east of DRC, with sustained human-to-human transmission \\[6\\]. Subsequently, cases infected with sub-clade Ib have been detected in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. In countries reporting clade Ib mpox cases, human-to-human transmission, both sexual and non-sexual transmission has been documented \\[24\\]. Currently, both clade Ia and clade Ib strains are causing outbreaks in DRC and in other central African countries.\n\nIn August 2024, Africa CDC announced that in 2024 at least 13 African countries had reported 2 863 confirmed mpox cases (all clades combined) and 517 confirmed and suspected deaths, and declared a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security \\[61\\]. Subsequently, the Director-General of the WHO declared the upsurge of mpox in the DRC and other countries in Africa a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and mentioned the risk of further spread of the new clade in addition outbreaks of other clades \\[62\\].\n\nMonthly reports of mpox cases worldwide since January 2022 are available on a [WHO website](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/ \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\n## Transmission\n\nMPXV is transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected animal or human, or contact with materials contaminated with the virus \\[1,63\\]. The virus enters the body through broken skin or the mucous membranes \\[63\\]. Human-to-human transmission of mpox occurs through close contact with infectious materials from the skin or mucosal lesions of an infected person, respiratory droplets in prolonged face-to-face contact, and fomites \\[2,17,32,63\\]. Human-to-human transmission also occurs during sexual contact \\[24,64\\].\n\nIn 2022, cases were identified primarily, but not exclusively, among men who have sex with men. Particular sexual practices (e.g. having multiple and frequent anonymous sexual contacts, and receptive anal sex) might have contributed to putting people at higher risk of infection.\n\nPeople who closely interact with an infectious person, such as healthcare workers, household members (including children), sexual partners, and sex workers are at greater risk of infection \\[25,64,65\\]. Occupational exposure and infection with orthopoxviruses have also been occasionally reported among laboratory personnel handling virus-containing specimens \\[66\\].\n\nEvidence is still emerging regarding transmission routes and transmission dynamics in the clade I outbreak in DRC and other African countries, but multiple modes are being reported, including sexual and household transmission \\[24\\].\n\n### Transmission dynamics in the 2022 clade II outbreak\n\nIn the 2022 clade II outbreak, the risk of infection following sexual exposure was found to be high. In a contact tracing study, 66% of exposed sexual contacts were ‘definitely or possibly’ infected compared to only 14% of non-sexual contacts \\[67\\]. MPXV was more often detected from skin, anal and throat samples than from blood, urine, and semen\\[68\\].Viral load in skin samples have been shown to be substantially higher compared to viral loads taken from other locations \\[32,69\\]. However, high viral loads have also been detected in anorectal samples, in particular, from patients with anorectal lesions \\[68\\].Replication-competent MPXV has been isolated in samples from skin lesions and anorectum, and less frequently from the oropharynx \\[69\\].\n\nWhether transmission of MPXV through genital secretions can occur is currently unclear. Other (rare) transmission routes, such as mother-to-child transmission\\[70\\] or nosocomial infection\\[71,72\\] have also been documented. Confirmed transmission of MPXV through substances of human origin (SoHO) has not been reported, however, its presence in body fluids and transmission during pregnancy and through the bites or scratches of an ill animal suggest that this transmission mode is theoretically possible\\[20\\].\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that infected people may transit MPXV up to four days prior to symptom onset. This evidence comes from modelling studies, studies on linked transmission pairs with known exposure times\\[26,33\\], and a viral shedding study that found viral DNA four days before symptom onset \\[67\\]. A study conducted in the UK found that 53% of transmission occurred during the pre-symptomatic period \\[33\\].\n\nThe infectious period lasts until all skin lesions have scabbed over and re-epithelialisation has occurred \\[32\\]. The proportion of positive samples from cases has decreased substantially approximately three weeks from symptom onset\\[68\\]. However, one study found that it takes around 40 days for 90% of the cases to have undetectable viral DNA in semen and skin lesions. This time was shorter for other types of lesions, although replication-competent MPXV was only detected up to three weeks after illness onset \\[69\\]. People with severe HIV infection have been shown to have a longer course of illness. Further studies are needed to determine whether this has an impact on the duration of infectivity \\[40\\].\n\nAsymptomatic mpox infections have been reported as well. Studies have found that between 1.3% and 6.5% of infected people have never experienced symptoms \\[73-75\\]. The role of asymptomatic cases in transmission is currently unclear.\n\n## Diagnostics\n\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) on skin lesion materials (e.g. swabs, exudate, or lesion crusts) is used to diagnose mpox. Several real-time PCR assays for the specific detection of MPXV, or for generic orthopoxvirus detection are available \\[76-81\\]. Mpox laboratory diagnostics are well established in several laboratories in Europe (seeEmerging Viral Diseases-Expert Laboratory Network – EVD-LabNet \\[82\\]).\n\nSerological tests have limited value in mpox diagnostics due to immunological cross-reactivity between human-pathogenic orthopoxviruses \\[83\\], although they can be useful for excluding a recent or past orthopoxvirus infection. For contact investigations and population serosurveys, Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) is available in some laboratories.\n\nDiagnostic procedures for MPXV and manipulation of specimens suspected to contain MPXV should be performed in biosafety level (BSL)-2 facilities as a minimum requirement\\[84,85\\]. MPXV is classified as a safety group 3 biological agent. Activities involving the handling of MPXV should, therefore, only be done in working areas corresponding to at least containment level three \\[85\\].\n\n## Case management and treatment\n\nNewly identified cases of mpox should undergo a medical assessment for severity and risk factors (e.g. underlying conditions or medications affecting immune competence, untreated HIV infection, etc.). Those at increased risk of severe disease from mpox may require hospitalisation and/or treatment with antivirals. Population groups at increased risk for severe disease include infants and young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and severely immunocompromised persons.\n\nCases should be instructed to isolate until their rash heals completely, which indicates the end of infectiousness. Recommendations mainly include the following:\n\n- Cases should remain in their own room, when at home, and use designated household items (clothes, bed linen, towels, eating utensils, plates, glasses, etc.), which should not be shared with other household members.\n- They should avoid contact with immunocompromised persons and others at risk for severe disease (such as infants and pregnant women) until their rash heals completely.\n- They should be monitored by public health authorities (e.g. via telephone calls or other means, according to national guidance).\n- They can temporarily leave their home (e.g. for medical appointments and necessary outdoor exercise for the stability of their mental health), provided they wear a medical face mask, and their rash is covered (e.g. by wearing long sleeves and trousers).\n- They should practise careful respiratory hygiene and wear a medical face mask when in contact with other people. In addition, mpox cases and their household contacts should practise careful hand hygiene at all times.\n- They should abstain from sexual activity until their rash completely heals i.e. no new lesions appear, scabs have fallen off, and new skin has formed. Although the protective effect of condoms is unknown as the virus can spread in other ways, they should still be used to protect against the spread through semen for 12 weeks after recovering from an mpox infection.\n- They should avoid contact with any mammalian animals (see also section on ‘Special considerations to mitigate the risk of animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission’).\n\nTreatment is primarily symptomatic and supportive (alleviation of fever, pruritus and pain, and hydration), including the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial infections. Tecovirimat is the only antiviral drug with market authorisation in the EU \\[86\\] with an indication for the treatment of orthopoxvirus infections, including mpox. Brincidofovir and cidofovir are other antiviral drug options for severe mpox cases but have significant side effects \\[87\\].\n\n## Public health control measures\n\nPublic health authorities can take several public health measures to mitigate transmission:\n\n- Raise awareness by appropriately targeting communication aimed at those most at risk for transmission or severe disease, including the active involvement of key stakeholders at the community level.\n- Facilitate the early diagnosis of people with mpox infection through easy access to healthcare services with well-informed clinicians, accessible diagnostics, and management guidance.\n- Facilitate the early detection of MPXV by implementing contact tracing in line with national recommendations \\[88\\].\n- Facilitate the diagnosis and isolation of people with MPXV infection.\n- Implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings \\[89\\].\n- Implement a national vaccination strategy against mpox.\n- Provide travel advice for people visiting or returning from countries with confirmed mpox outbreaks.\n- Continue implementing risk communication activities and working with civil society organisations to engage population groups at higher risk of infection.\n\n## Infection control, personal protection and prevention\n\n_Last updated on 8 October 2024_\n\n### Vaccine and vaccination strategies\n\nSince 22 July 2022, the third-generation non-replicating smallpox vaccine Imvanex – Modified Vaccinia Ankara - Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) has been authorised in the EU for protection against mpox in adults \\[90,91\\]. The vaccine had already been approved for active immunisation against smallpox in 2013 \\[90\\]. On 19 September 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended extending the indication of Imvanex vaccine to adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age \\[92\\].\n\nImvanex is authorised to protect adults and adolescents from mpox and the disease caused by the vaccinia virus. These new indications were added to Imvanex's existing authorisation against smallpox, which has been in the EU since 2013. For protection against mpox, Imvanex is administered as a subcutaneous injection (0.5 ml), with a two-dose regimen. The second dose is given at least 28 days after the first as primary vaccination to individuals previously not vaccinated against smallpox, monkeypox or vaccinia viruses\\[93\\]. When given as a post-exposure vaccination, this should be administered ideally within four days of first exposure (and up to 14 days after exposure in the absence of symptoms)\\[94\\].. The safety profile of MVA-BN is favourable, with mild to moderate side effects. Older generation smallpox vaccines have significant side effects and are not authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nThe vaccine effectiveness of two pre-exposure vaccine (PPV) doses is estimated as 82% (95% CI: 72–92), while even one PPV dose provides effectiveness of 76% (95% CI: 64–88) \\[95\\]. For post-exposure vaccination (PEPV) the vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 20% (95% CI: -24–65) \\[95\\]. In individuals who experienced infection after having been vaccinated, disease was less severe compared to unvaccinated individuals \\[96\\]. Clade-specific vaccine effectiveness evidence is currently lacking \\[97\\] but the third-generation smallpox vaccine is expected to have similar vaccine effectiveness against MPXV clade I, although real-world data is not yet available.\n\n### **Special considerations in healthcare settings and home isolation**\n\n_Last updated on 8 October 2024_\n\nThe principal mode of MPXV transmission is thought to be direct contact with mpox lesions or objects contaminated with lesions, such as clothing and bed linen (fomites). Therefore, caregivers and household members should avoid touching skin lesions with their bare hands, wear disposable gloves when handling materials which were in contact with the bare skin of a patient (including clothes, bed linen and towels), and observe strict hand hygiene before and after the use of gloves.\n\nIn healthcare settingsstandard and transmission-based precautions should be applied in patient care for those suspected and confirmed with mpox infection \\[17\\]. Mpox infection prevention and control guidance for primary and acute care settings have been developed by ECDC \\[89\\]. Detailed options are also available in guidance documents developed by the WHO \\[98\\] and the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA)\\[99\\].\n\n### **Safety of Substances of Human Origin**\n\nMPXV has been detected in blood, urine, tissue abscesses and bodily fluids \\[69,100\\] and could potentially be transmitted through Substances of Human Origin (SoHO). However, to date, there has been no reported transmission of MPXV through SoHO and the likelihood of this is unknown.\n\nClose contacts of suspected or confirmed mpox cases with either clade I or clade II, who are not deferred due to other risks, should be deferred from donation.\n\nNo locally acquired cases of clade I mpox have been reported in the EU/EEA to date in the context of the current clade I outbreak in some African countries. Prospective donors returning from countries where clade I MPXV has been detected and who are not deferred due to other risks should be carefully interviewed regarding their contacts with suspected or confirmed mpox cases or infected animals. In the event of deceased donors, data on the medical history of these risk factors should be collected.\n\nBased on the incubation period, it is recommended to defer asymptomatic donors who have been in contact with mpox cases (confirmed or suspected) from SoHO donation, for a minimum of 21 days from the last day of exposure. It should be noted that the available information on the incubation period is based on individuals manifesting symptoms. The possibility of MPXV transmission by asymptomatic individuals is unknown. In the donor assessment process, attention should be paid to the wide range of clinical presentations of the disease in recent outbreaks (see ‘clinical features and sequelae’). Evaluations should not overlook mild and non-specific signs. Donors with confirmed or suspected MPXV infection should be deferred from donation for at least 14 days after resolution of all symptoms. Due to the isolation of replication-competent virus from semen \\[69,101\\], where it is a necessary to store semen (e.g. fertility preservation), it is advisable to perform PCR of the semen sample.\n\n### **Special considerations to mitigate the risk of animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission**\n\nTo reduce animal-to-human transmission in areas with active MPXV circulation among wildlife, it is recommended to avoid contact with (potential) animal reservoirs and any materials that have been in contact with a potentially infected sick or dead animal.\n\nSimilarly, human cases of mpox should avoid close direct contact with animals including pet animals, livestock and wild animals (in captivity). Close contacts of cases should also avoid being in close direct contact with animals for 21 days after the last exposure to the virus. To mitigate the risk of wild animals getting in contact with the virus, waste, including medical waste, should be disposed of in a safe manner and should not be accessible to rodents and other scavenger animals.\n\n### **Further reading**\n\nAdditional information can be found in the following links:\n\n[Public health guidance\\\\\n\\\\\n**Considerations for contact tracing during the monkeypox outbreak in Europe, 2022**](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/considerations-contact-tracing-during-monkeypox-outbreak-europe-2022)\n\n28 Jun 2022\n\n[Public health guidance\\\\\n\\\\\n**Monkeypox infection prevention and control guidance for primary and acute care settings**](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/monkeypox-infection-prevention-and-control-guidance-primary-and-acute-care)\n\n16 Aug 2022\n\n[**European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) - Monkeypox factsheet**](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/monkeypox)\n\n[**World Health Organization (WHO).

However, if it has been longer than 4 weeks since you got the first dose, get the 2nd dose as soon as possible.\n- Whether or not you've been vaccinated, continue to reduce your risk of getting monkeypox.\n- CDC has recommendations for who should get the vaccine to protect against monkeypox.\n\n![Nurse gives a patient a bandage after subcutaneous injection](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/11/subcut-bandaid.jpg)\n\n## Overview\n\nVaccination is an important tool in stopping the spread of monkeypox. If you have certain risk factors that make you eligible, you can help protect yourself from monkeypox by getting the monkeypox vaccine. Contact your healthcare provider, local pharmacy, or [local health department](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) to find monkeypox vaccine in your area.\n\nPeople who are vaccinated [should continue to avoid close, skin-to-skin contact](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/prevention/index.html) with someone who has monkeypox.\n\nAt this time, getting more than two monkeypox vaccine doses (a \"booster\") isn't recommended. If you've already had both recommended doses, you don't need any more, even if you've been exposed to someone with monkeypox.\n\nIf you've recovered from monkeypox, CDC does not recommend that you get JYNNEOS vaccine doses at this time. While it is possible for people who have recovered from monkeypox to get monkeypox, it's very rare (less than 0.001%). If they did get monkeypox again, the illness was generally milder than the first time.\n\n### Countries experiencing person-to-person monkeypox spread\n\nCDC has vaccination recommendations for [people traveling](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp) to countries with [clade I outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html) or [new clade II outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html). **As of September 15, 2025,** countries with sustained clade I monkeypox transmission include Burundi, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. Countries with new **clade II outbreaks** include [Liberia and Sierra Leone](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia).\n\n## Who should get vaccinated\n\nCDC recommends vaccination if:\n\n- You had known or suspected exposure to someone with monkeypox\n- You had a sex partner in the past 2 weeks who was diagnosed with monkeypox\n- You are a gay, bisexual, or other man who has sex with men, or are transgender or nonbinary and in the past 6 months have had any of the following:\n  - A new diagnosis of one or more sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis)\n  - More than one sex partner\n- You have had any of the following in the past 6 months:\n  - Sex at a commercial sex venue (like a sex club or bathhouse)\n  - Sex related to a large commercial event or in a geographic area (city or county for example) where monkeypox virus transmission is occurring\n- You have a sex partner with any of the above risks\n- You anticipate experiencing any of the above scenarios\n- If you are traveling to a country with a clade I monkeypox outbreak and anticipate any of the following activities during travel:\n  - Sex with a new partner\n  - Sex at a commercial sex venue (e.g., a sex club or bathhouse)\n  - Sex in exchange for money, goods, drugs, or other trade\n  - Sex in association with a large public event (e.g., a rave, party, or festival)\n- You are at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses (e.g., certain people who work in a laboratory or a healthcare facility).\n\nYou should NOT get the vaccine if:\n\nYou had a severe allergic reaction (such as anaphylaxis) after getting a previous dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine or to a vaccine component.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider if you had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics gentamicin or ciprofloxacin, or chicken or egg protein.\n\n## How the vaccine is given\n\nThe vaccine can be given to you subcutaneously, which means that the vaccine will be injected in the fat layer underneath the skin on the back of your upper arm (the area above the tricep muscle).\n\nOr, the vaccine may be given between the top layers of your skin. This is called an intradermal vaccination. It can be placed in your forearm or other areas, including your upper back just below the shoulder blade or the skin of your shoulder above the deltoid muscle.\n\nYou and your provider can discuss which method to use.\n\nIntradermal vaccination may leave a mark that others can see on your forearm. If that concerns you, you have several options:\n\n- Ask for the vaccine to be given to you subcutaneously.\n- Ask to get the vaccine in the skin of your upper back (just below the shoulder blade) or the skin of your shoulder (the area above the deltoid muscle).\n\nIf you have ever had keloid scars (thick, raised scars), ask for the vaccine to be given to you subcutaneously.\nIf you are under 18 years of age, you should be given the vaccine subcutaneously.\nGetting the vaccine intradermally or subcutaneously is equally effective against monkeypox.\n\nAlthough findings suggest that the first dose of JYNNEOS vaccine gives some protection against monkeypox, two doses are recommended to provide stronger protection. Whether you get the vaccine subcutaneously or intradermally, you should still get two doses. The second dose should be given 4 weeks (28 days) after the first dose. If you can't get your second dose on time, you should get it as soon as possible to complete the series.\n\nHow long it takes for the vaccine to work\n\nYou can start to have an immune response after the first dose of JYNNEOS, but it takes two weeks after the second dose to be the most protected.\n\nIt's not known how long protection might last, or if protection might decrease over time. CDC is analyzing the current data and conducting studies to enhance the knowledge on how well the JYNNEOS vaccine works during the current monkeypox outbreak, as well as how long protection might last. These studies will be used to make future vaccine recommendations.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nNot everyone has side effects, but some people do. The most common side effects after JYNNEOS vaccination are pain, redness, and itching at the spot where the vaccine is given. You might also experience fever, headache, tiredness, nausea, chills, and muscle aches. These are signs that your immune system is responding, not that you're getting sick.\n\nWhen JYNNEOS vaccine is given intradermally, some people have reported less pain after vaccination but more side effects like itching, swelling, redness, thickening of the skin, and skin discoloration at the spot where the vaccine was given. Some of these side effects may last for several weeks. If you have concerns about receiving the vaccine intradermally, you can ask for the vaccine to be given to you subcutaneously in the fat layer underneath the skin on the back of your upper arm (triceps).\n\n## Finding and paying for the vaccine\n\nWhere you can get vaccinated\n\n- In some large cities, monkeypox vaccines may be available at the health department, public health clinics, hospitals, pharmacies or even at large social gatherings or venues.\n- In other areas, monkeypox vaccines may only be available from the health department.\n- Contact your healthcare provider, local pharmacy, or [local health department](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) for monkeypox vaccine availability.\n\nVaccine cost\n\n- The cost of JYNNEOS vaccine may be covered by some health insurance plans.\n- Federal agencies are working to incorporate JYNNEOS vaccine into their programs to support broad access to this vaccine, including among people who are uninsured and underinsured.\n\n### Insurance coverage for JYNNEOS vaccine\n\nLearn more about health insurance coverage policies for JYNNEOS, including Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, VA, TRICARE, and private or commercial insurance.\n\n[JYNNEOS coverage fact sheet Oct 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/pdfs/2024/10/JYNNEOS-Coverage-Fact-Sheet-10-24.pdf)\n\n[Monkeypox after Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/mpox-after-vaccination.html)\n\nSept. 15, 2025\n\n[Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html#content-sources) [Print](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html#print) [Share](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html#share)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmonkeypox%2Fvaccines%2Findex.html \"Share to Facebook\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmonkeypox%2Fvaccines%2Findex.html&title=Monkeypox%20Vaccination \"Share to LinkedIn\") [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmonkeypox%2Fvaccines%2Findex.html&text=Monkeypox%20Vaccination \"Share to Twitter\") [Syndicate](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/sharecontent \"Embed this Page\")\n\nContent Source:\n\n[National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/index.html)\n\n## Related Pages\n\n- [Monkeypox after Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/mpox-after-vaccination.html)\n- [Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/prevention/index.html)\n- [Testing](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/testing/index.html)\n- [What to Do If You Are Sick](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/caring/index.html)\n- [Planning for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/travel/index.html)\n\n[View AllMonkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html#gen)\n\nBack to Top\n\n## [Monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/index.html)\n\nMonkeypox is a viral disease that can be spread between people or between people and certain animals.\n\n[View All](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html)\n\n### [For Everyone](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/index.html\\#gen)\n\n- [Current Situation](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html)\n- [U.S. Case Data: Clade II Monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/data-research/cases/index.html)\n- [About](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/about/index.html)\n- [Signs and Symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n- [Outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/index.html)\n- [How It Spreads](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/causes/index.html)\n- [Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/prevention/index.html)\n- [Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html)\n- [View all](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html#gen)\n\n### [Health Care Providers](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html\\#hcp)\n\n- [Case Definitions](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html)\n- [Clinical Overview](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html)\n- [Clinical Features](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html)\n- [View All](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html#hcp)\n\n### [Public Health](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html\\#php)\n\n- [Case Reporting](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/case-reporting/index.html)\n- [Monitoring and Risk Assessment](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/monitoring/index.html)\n- [Guidance for Health Departments](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/public-health-strategy/index.html)\n- [View All](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/site.html#php)\n\n[Sign up for Email Updates](https://tools.cdc.gov/campaignproxyservice/subscriptions.aspx#featured)\n\n[Go to top](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html# \"Go to top\")",
