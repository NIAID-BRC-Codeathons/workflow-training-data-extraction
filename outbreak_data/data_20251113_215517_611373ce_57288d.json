When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

West Texas saw a measles outbreak this year.\n**Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images** **hide caption**\n\n**toggle caption**\n\n\nJan Sonnenmair/Getty Images\n\n\n\nNearly two months after a deadly, massive measles outbreak in Texas was [declared over,](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak) the highly contagious disease continues to spread across the country. The U.S. has now confirmed [1,596 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest annual number [in more than three decades](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health).\n\nBut the true total could be even higher, says [Dr. Paul Offit](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a), director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\"If you talk to people on the ground, including not only in Texas, but other states, they all say the same thing, which is that the numbers are much worse than that. Probably closer to 5,000 cases,\" Offit says. \"And it's not done.\"\n\nHe points to the current outbreak in South Carolina, where 139 schoolchildren at two schools are now subject to a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The state Department of Public Health on Tuesday [reported its 16th measles](https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-16-total-2025-12-related-upstate) case since July, including 12 cases directly linked to an ongoing outbreak in Spartanburg County.\n\n[![Routine childhood vaccination rates have been dropping across the U.S. and vaccine-preventable childhood diseases have been rising.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1414x1414+543+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2F92%2F8c8c7286468ab47e022ef7d65d23%2Fgettyimages-1313998982-1.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5188676/trump-election-2024-vaccines-rfk)\n\n### [Shots - Health News](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/)\n\n### [What happens when a vaccine skeptic leads health policy?

She said that makes it vital that the public receive the recommended measles vaccination.\n\nMeanwhile, a large measles outbreak along the border areas of Arizona and southwestern Utah continues to grow, with Utah now [reporting 56 cases](https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/) this year as of Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated. Six people required hospitalization. According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, wastewater testing shows that the measles virus is more widespread in the state than previously known.\n\nIn neighboring Arizona, officials have reported [77 cases](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php) so far this year as of Tuesday — including 14 new cases since last week.\n\nAnd in Minnesota, officials last week reported that a small, recent surge in measles cases there has brought the state's [total for the year to 20](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/stats.html).\n\nAll told, the CDC [has confirmed](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) 44 measles outbreaks in 41 states this year. The agency defines an outbreak as three or more cases that are linked.The vast majority of cases were in people who were unvaccinated; 27% percent have been in children under the age of 5. About 1 in 8 measles cases have resulted in hospitalization.\n\n### Widespread vaccination in the U.S. has saved hundreds of lives each year\n\nMeasles is one of the most [contagious diseases](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread) known to humans. On average, an infected person will infect as many as 18 other unvaccinated people. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left a room. That's why it's so highly transmissible.\n\nBefore widespread vaccination, pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 people in the U.S. used to die from it each year.\n\n[![A person enters a CVS store in Monterey Park, California,  where flu and COVID-19 vaccines are offered. ](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5312x5312+1937+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fe5%2F0ed7355d4925837197c6108f9630%2Fgettyimages-2237018794.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation)\n\n### [Living Better](https://www.npr.org/series/1176326550/living-better)\n\n### [The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation)\n\nThe disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. To protect communities against outbreaks, they need a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC.\n\nNationwide, measles vaccination rates have been slipping for years — [they're currently at 92.5%](https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html). The trend predates the current administration, but Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, says it doesn't help that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long history of criticizing vaccines. Ratner notes that acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill has suggested breaking up the standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine [into three separate shots](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation), which Ratner says is neither feasible nor is it backed by evidence.\n\nIn a statement to NPR on Tuesday, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, \"Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,\" and wants to ensure that vaccines \"are backed by gold standard science.\" He added, \"Secretary Kennedy has been outspoken in his support for the measles vaccine.\"\n\nKennedy [endorsed the measles vaccine](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury) earlier this year. But senators from both parties have [accused Kennedy of undermining vaccine access and politicizing vaccines](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5528966/rfk-kennedy-hearing-covid-vaccines-cdc) with his approach to vaccine policy.\n\n\"It's no wonder that parents are, you know, confused and frightened,\" says Ratner, the author of _Booster Shots_, a history of the fight against measles and its recent resurgence.\n\nIn some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower than the national average. That's created pockets of opportunity for measles to spread, Ratner says.\n\n\"If a measles case comes into a place with a low vaccination rate, it can really take off,\" Ratner says. \"That's what we saw in Gaines County\" — the epicenter of the Texas outbreak that saw [762 cases and two deaths](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak) — \"and that's what we're seeing in lots of places.\"\n\n- [measles](https://www.npr.org/tags/136620805/measles)\n\n- **Facebook**\n- **Flipboard**\n- **Email**\n\n![NPR Plus logo](https://prod-eks-static-assets.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-plus/npr-plus-combo-logo.svg)\n\n##### Exclusive benefits\n\n###### Give a little.

As of 8 August 2025, a total of 10,139 confirmed measles cases and 18 related deaths have been reported across ten countries, representing a 34-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThe outbreaks are linked primarily to low vaccination coverage, with 71% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals and a further 18% in people whose vaccination status is unknown. In 2024, coverage with the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the region reached 89% (two percentage points higher than in 2023), while the second dose increased from 76% to 79%. However, these levels remain below the 95% recommended to prevent outbreaks.\n\n“Measles is preventable with two doses of a vaccine, which is proven to be very safe and effective. To stop these outbreaks, countries must urgently strengthen routine immunization and conduct targeted vaccination campaigns in high-risk communities,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, Executive Manager of the Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization at PAHO.\n\nCountries with the highest case numbers include Canada (4,548 cases), Mexico (3,911 cases), and the United States (1,356 cases). Other countries reporting confirmed cases are Bolivia (229), Argentina (35), Belize (34), Brazil (17), Paraguay (4), Peru (4), and Costa Rica (1). Paraguay is the latest country to report an outbreak this year. Deaths have been reported in Mexico (14), the United States (3), and Canada (1). In Mexico most deaths have occurred in indigenous people between 1 and 54 years of age. Canada reported a fatal congenital measles infection in a newborn.\n\nThe current outbreaks are associated with two genotypes of the measles virus. One genotype has been identified in outbreaks across eight countries, particularly among Mennonite communities in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Belize, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Given that measles is a highly contagious viral disease, it spreads rapidly among unvaccinated populations, especially children. However, recent data suggests an increasing number of cases outside of these groups.\n\n## Countries highlights\n\n- In **Canada**, national trends shows that transmission is persisting, particularly in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario, following an outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024.\n- In **Mexico**, a mass vaccination campaign targeting people aged 6 months to 49 years is underway in 14 priority municipalities that have active measles transmission in Chihuahua, which accounts for 93% of the country’s cases. Indigenous communities have been hardest hit, with a case-fatality rate 20 times higher than in the general population.\n- The **United States** has reported outbreaks in 41 jurisdictions, mainly among under-vaccinated Mennonite populations, though no new cases have been reported in Texas or New Mexico since late July.\n- In **Bolivia**, most cases are concentrated in Santa Cruz, with additional cases reported in seven other departments, affecting both the general population and Mennonite communities.\n- **Argentina** and **Belize** have seen no new cases since late June.\n- **Brazil** has reported 16 cases in Tocantins, linked to the regional outbreak.\n\n## PAHO response and recommendations\n\nPAHO is providing direct technical cooperation across the region to support surveillance, case investigation, outbreak response, laboratory diagnostics, and vaccination efforts. This includes deploying experts to countries such as Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia; monitoring importation risks in Brazil and Paraguay; strengthening surveillance systems; and working with communities and health workers to counter misinformation and promote vaccine uptake.\n\nThe Organization urges countries to:\n\n- Achieve and sustain high immunization coverage (at least 95% with two doses of measles-containing vaccine),\n- reinforce rapid response systems to contain outbreaks quickly,\n- scale up vaccination strategies from selective approaches (such as ring or mop-up vaccination) to mass campaigns in outbreak and high-risk areas, based on the epidemiological situation and population movement.\n- ensure timely detection and laboratory confirmation of cases,\n- and engage at-risk communities to improve health literacy and address vaccine hesitancy.\n\nPAHO does not recommend travel restrictions but advises travelers to ensure they are vaccinated, especially when visiting areas with active outbreaks. This includes children aged 6 to 11 months, who are not usually covered by routine immunization programs but should receive early protection in outbreak contexts.\n\n## Regional and global context\n\nThe Americas interrupted endemic transmission of measles in 2016, a milestone unique at the global level. Although endemic transmission reappeared in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019, both countries regained their elimination status in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, keeping measles at bay in the Americas remains a challenge, as the virus continues to circulate widely in other parts of the world and vaccine-hesitant groups are spread throughout the region.\n\nGlobally, surveillance data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 239,816 suspected cases and 108,074 confirmed cases in all WHO Regions, as of July 2025. The Eastern Mediterranean Region accounts for the highest share (35%), followed by the African Region (21%) and the European Region (21%).\n\n[News Releases](https://www.paho.org/en/news/news-releases)\n\n[Immunization](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/immunization)\n\n[Measles](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles)\n\n[Brasil](https://www.paho.org/pt/brasil)\n\n[Paraguay](https://www.paho.org/es/paraguay)\n\n[Uruguay](https://www.paho.org/es/uruguay)\n\n[Comprehensive Immunization (CIM)](https://www.paho.org/en/comprehensive-immunization-cim)\n\n## Latest news\n\n[![Measles patient](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/measles-patient.jpg?h=ae97dba1&itok=bnGMZyUl)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n[PAHO calls for regional action as the Americas lose measles elimination status](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n10 Nov 2025\n\n[![Arrival of aid to Jamaica](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/emt-aecid-llegada.jpg?h=eed8f32f&itok=Hh60dlMe)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n[PAHO scales up its emergency health response across the Caribbean following Hurricane Melissa](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[![Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO, Florika Fink-Hooijer, Director-General of HERA, and European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, who oversees HERA within the European Commission.](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/acuerdo-comision-europea.jpg?h=717d0fcf&itok=qG_9hwe-)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n[PAHO and European Commission’s Health Emergency Authority make deal to boost preparedness for cross-border health threats](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[See all the news](https://www.paho.org/en/news)",

And in South Carolina, a measles outbreak linked to two schools with low student vaccination rates has grown by 4 cases.\n\nThe total represents the most US infections since 1992, when the CDC reported 2,237 measles cases.\n\n### **Upstate South Carolina outbreak hits 20 cases**\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) said in a press release yesterday there were 4 more confirmed cases in Spartanburg County, raising the state's total number of measles cases [this year to 23](https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-four-23-total-2025-20-now-related \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\nTwenty of the 23 cases, including the 4 most recent, are part of the current Upstate outbreak that is focused in Spartanburg County. Two of the recent patients are close contacts to known cases who have been quarantining at home, and two are associated with a business in Spartanburg with no public exposures.\n\n“Some cases are travel-related exposures or close contacts of known cases. Other cases have no identified source, suggesting that measles is circulating in the community and could spread further,” [DPH said](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/viruses-parasites-bacterial-infections/measles-rubeola/2025 \"(opens in a new window)\"). \"We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\"\n\n> We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\n\nToday and tomorrow, exposed students will return to in-person learning at two schools that were associated with the Upstate outbreak.\n\n### **Southwest has high case count**\n\n[Elsewhere in the country](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/us-records-highest-number-of-measles-since-1992-cdc-says/ \"(opens in a new window)\"), measles activity is still high in Utah and Arizona, with more than 100 cases reported in neighboring counties, including [Mohave County, Arizona,](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php \"(opens in a new window)\") which has seen 80 cases. Experts say the outbreak, similar to the major West Texas outbreak earlier this year, is rooted in communities with historically low vaccination rates.\n\nOf the 1,618 measles cases in the United States, 87% are part of 43 outbreaks of three or more related cases.\n\n\"For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024, and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated,\" the CDC said.\n\nTwelve percent of cases this year have required hospitalization (198 of 1,618), including 95 children under the age of 5 years. Three people have died from measles.\n\nNinety-two percent of cases in the United States are in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccine status isn't known.\n\n## Related news\n\n[**Outbreaks in Southwest, South Carolina grow as US tracks 30 more measles cases**\\\\\n\\\\\nOctober 29, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStephanie Soucheray\\\\\n\\\\\n![measles exam](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/iStock-2226510461.jpg?itok=C5is--wa)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/outbreaks-southwest-south-carolina-grow-us-tracks-30-more-measles-cases)\n\n[**Measles outbreak in South Carolina grows; Canada’s elimination status threatened**\\\\\n\\\\\nOctober 27, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStephanie Soucheray\\\\\n\\\\\n![measles torso](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/iStock-2152300023.jpg?itok=pQyb3Ebo)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-grows-canada-s-elimination-status-threatened)\n\n[**More measles in South Carolina as US nears 1,600 confirmed cases**\\\\\n\\\\\nOctober 15, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStephanie Soucheray\\\\\n\\\\\n![measles on boy's neck and face](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/iStock-2152300024_0.jpg?itok=3O1uTuh2)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/more-measles-south-carolina-us-nears-1600-confirmed-cases)\n\n[**CIDRAP Op-Ed: Why the CDC director is wrong about the MMR vaccine**\\\\\n\\\\\nOctober 9, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nJake Scott, MD\\\\\n\\\\\n![Three syringes](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/Three%20intersecting%20syringes.jpg?itok=ZzxHOlTZ)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/cidrap-op-ed-why-cdc-director-wrong-about-mmr-vaccine)\n\n[**Canada loses measles elimination status after record year of outbreaks**\\\\\n\\\\\nNovember 10, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStephanie Soucheray\\\\\n\\\\\n![measles shot](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/1024px-21st_TSC_gives_Afghan_evacuees_Measles_vaccine_%286844325%29%20%281%29_0.jpg?itok=cKOoeAZt)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-after-record-year-outbreaks)\n\n[**More measles cases reported in Utah, Arizona**\\\\\n\\\\\nNovember 5, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nChris Dall\\\\\n\\\\\n![Measles rash on arm](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/measles%20rash%20on%20arm%20%281%29%20%281%29_0.jpg?itok=Fi9e6lKw)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/more-measles-cases-reported-utah-arizona)\n\n[**US hot spots see more measles cases**\\\\\n\\\\\nNovember 3, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nStephanie Soucheray\\\\\n\\\\\n![measles boy](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hand_curated_related_teaser/public/article/young%20boy%20with%20measles_0.jpg?itok=u7JVWWYA)](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-hot-spots-see-more-measles-cases)\n\n[**Support for measles vaccination drops amid growing confusion about the disease, US poll shows**\\\\\n\\\\\nOctober 31, 2025\\\\\n\\\\\nJim Wappes\\\\\n\\\\\n![Robert F.

As of Nov. 12, 2025, [DPH is reporting 46 cases of measles](https://dph.sc.gov/news/wednesday-measles-update-dph-confirms-8-new-measles-cases-upstate-outbreak-bringing-outbreak \"WEDNESDAY MEASLES UPDATE: DPH Confirms 8 new Measles Cases in Upstate Outbreak, Bringing Outbreak Total to 43, Total Reported This Year to 46\") since July 9, 43 centered around Spartanburg County in the current outbreak.\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2025, [DPH confirmed a measles outbreak in Upstate region](https://dph.sc.gov/news/dph-confirms-measles-outbreak-upstate-region \"DPH Confirms Measles Outbreak in Upstate Region\"). An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same infectious disease linked to a common exposure.\n\nThere has been a rise in measles cases in the Upstate this year, with most concentrated in Spartanburg County.\n\nSome cases are travel-related exposures or close contacts of known cases. Other cases have no identified source, suggesting that measles is circulating in the community and could spread further. We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Measles is highly contagious**:\n  - A person is **contagious four days** **before** **and** **after** **a rash begins**, meaning someone can spread measles before they know they are infected.\n  - The virus can **linger in the air for up to two hours** after an infected person leaves.\n- The measles vaccine (MMR and MMRV) is the best way to protect yourself and others against measles. Use the [DPH Recommendations for Measles Vaccination chart](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/Measles_Outbreak_Vaccine_Recommendations_20251020.pdf) to understand if you need to be vaccinated or not.\n\n## Updates\n\nWe will post measles updates twice a week, at noon on Tuesday and Friday. In time, this update frequency may change to more or less each week depending on disease activity.\n\n### Mobile Health Unit (MHU) Vaccines\n\nIn response to the ongoing measles outbreak, the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) has activated its Mobile Health Unit to deploy to the following locations to offer measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to unvaccinated individuals at no cost. _NOTE: The MMR vaccine is given as a two-dose series and booster doses are generally not needed. DPH also provides information about vaccine services by other providers.

Measles\n\nMost people recover from measles completely on their own. For uncomplicated cases, bed rest, drinking plenty of fluids and over-the-counter medications to reduce the fever and headache may help make infected individuals more comfortable. For those who require hospitalization, supportive care is the only treatment.\n\nDPH’s [measles page](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola \"Measles (Rubeola)\") contains what people need to know about measles (e.g., video, educational materials), and frequently asked questions about symptoms, prevention, vaccination history, and DPH’s role in protecting South Carolina from measles.\n\n### Understanding South Carolina's Vaccination Rates Among School Children\n\nWe still have vulnerable populations, both nationally and in South Carolina. The CDC reports that in 2025: the majority, 97%, of people who got measles were unvaccinated. Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. Travelers with measles continue to bring measles into the U.S. Measles can spread easily when it reaches a community where groups of people are unvaccinated. Based on the 2021 CDC NIS (National Immunization Survey) Child data, coverage rates in the 19- to 35-month-old survey indicate that 88.9% of these aged children in South Carolina have had at least one dose of MMR vaccine. In South Carolina, two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school entry for kindergarten through 12th grade. For the 2023-2024 school year, 92.1% of kindergarten students had two doses of MMR vaccine, down from 95% for the 2019-2020 school year.\n\n- [45-Day Report of Schools with Required Immunization Certification, 2024-2025 School Year](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/45_Day_Report_24-25_20251014.pdf) (pdf)\n- [School Vaccination Coverage and Exemption Data by County](https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and \"School Vaccination Coverage and Exemption Data by County\")\n\n### U.S. Data\n\nFind the latest numbers of confirmed U.S. measles cases.

Key drivers of vaccine hesitancy (misinformation about vaccine safety, philosophical and religious exemptions, and pandemic-related disruptions) are discussed, along with the demographic patterns of under-vaccination in the U.S. Comparisons are drawn to notable measles outbreaks in Samoa (2019) and the United Kingdom (2018) to highlight common themes of insufficient immunity leading to severe outcomes. The review evaluates what aspects of the public health response were effective, including emergency vaccination campaigns, community engagement, and interagency coordination, and what challenges and failures impeded control, such as resource limitations and delayed counter-misinformation efforts. The economic impact of the outbreak is also considered, with containment efforts costing millions of dollars. We summarize the lessons learned about the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and suggest policy implications, which include stricter immunization requirements, proactive education to combat misinformation, and strengthening immunization infrastructure. Finally, future directions and recommendations are presented to prevent measles from regaining a foothold, emphasizing that sustained commitment to vaccination and public trust is critical to averting similar crises.\n\n**Keywords:** measles, public health coverage, united states of america, vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy\n\n## Introduction and background\n\nMeasles, once a ubiquitous childhood infection in the U.S., was declared eliminated nationally in 2000 after decades of widespread vaccination and vigilant surveillance \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF1)\\]. Yet elimination never guaranteed permanence. During the 2010s, an erosion of public confidence in vaccines, amplified by online misinformation, chipped away at the herd immunity that had suppressed endemic transmission \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF2)\\]. Concerningly, kindergarten coverage with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine fell from 95.2% in the 2019-2020 school year to 92.7% in 2023-2024, leaving an estimated 280,000 children susceptible \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3)\\].\n\nThe consequences of those immunity gaps became starkly apparent in early 2025. On 30 May 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,088 confirmed measles cases across 33 jurisdictions, including the first measles-related deaths recorded in the country since 2015 \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF4)\\]. More than 90% of patients were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, and nearly all cases were epidemiologically linked to undervaccinated communities in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Air travel and domestic tourism quickly distributed the virus to additional states, illustrating how a single imported case can ignite nationwide spread when local protection is uneven.\n\nAlthough the absolute numbers remain modest compared with the pre-vaccine era, the 2025 outbreak represents the largest U.S. measles crisis in a decade and a critical stress test of the nation’s vaccine policy architecture. It also mirrors recent international setbacks, notably the 2018 United Kingdom resurgence and the 2019 Samoa epidemic, underscoring that measles control is precarious wherever vaccination falters.\n\nIn this narrative review, we synthesize current evidence to elucidate (1) the historical and epidemiologic context of the 2025 U.S. outbreak, (2) the socio-behavioral and policy drivers of vaccine hesitancy that primed the crisis, (3) the strengths and weaknesses of the public health response, (4) the human and economic costs incurred, and (5) the lessons and forward-looking strategies required to restore and sustain measles elimination. By integrating national data with insights from global comparators, we aim to furnish clinicians, policymakers, and public health practitioners with a comprehensive blueprint for preventing measles from regaining a foothold in the U.S.\n\n## Review\n\nMethods\n\nFor this narrative review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and official health organization websites (CDC, WHO) to identify sources on measles outbreaks, vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy, and public health responses published between 2010 and 2025. Sources were eligible if they (i) contained primary or secondary data on measles epidemiology, vaccination coverage, or hesitancy; (ii) were published in English during 2010-2025; and (iii) offered a verifiable DOI or permanent URL. Editorials without data, conference abstracts, and duplicate preprints were excluded. Search terms included combinations of “measles,” “outbreak,” “vaccine hesitancy,” “measles 2025,” “vaccination coverage,” “measles mortality,” and “measles elimination.” We prioritized peer-reviewed articles (epidemiological studies, reviews, commentaries) and authoritative reports (e.g., Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) briefs, WHO updates), with particular focus on data from the 2025 U.S. outbreak and comparator events such as the 2019 Samoa epidemic and the 2018 measles resurgence in Europe. Outbreak case counts and vaccination-coverage figures were cross-checked against the CDC and WHO databases for accuracy. All U.S. 2025 figures reflect data current as of 30 May 2025.\n\nHistorical perspective and outbreak epidemiology\n\nMeasles elimination in the U.S. was achieved in 2000 through decades of high vaccine coverage and aggressive public health campaigns \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF5)\\]. In the years immediately after, only a handful of cases occurred annually, typically in travelers or their close contacts. However, by the 2010s, declining vaccination in certain communities led to a series of outbreaks. For example, in 2017, a measles outbreak in Minnesota’s Somali-American community, where unfounded fears about MMR causing autism had spread, resulted in 75 cases \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF6)\\]. These incidents were a prelude to a larger resurgence in 2019, when the U.S. recorded 1,282 cases, the most since 1992 \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF7)\\]. That year, the vast majority of cases were confined to under-immunized enclaves, including a prolonged outbreak of 934 cases in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in New York that nearly cost the country its elimination status. Although no measles deaths occurred in 2019, the outbreaks were a wake-up call that highlighted growing vaccine complacency.\n\nThis American pattern mirrored global trends. Europe saw measles cases surge in 2018-2019, and the United Kingdom lost its measles-free status after a protracted outbreak (991 cases in 2018) reestablished endemic transmission \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF8)\\]. In late 2019, Samoa experienced a devastating measles epidemic, with over 5,700 cases and 83 deaths, after national MMR coverage fell to around 30% \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF9)\\]. These examples demonstrate that if vaccination rates decline, measles can resurface and cause significant harm.\n\nOutbreak epidemiology\n\nThe 2025 U.S. measles outbreak began in early January, seeded by an infected traveler in a close-knit, undervaccinated community in West Texas. From there, the virus spread across at least three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma) among populations with historically low MMR uptake. By 17 April 2025, the CDC had reported 800 cases nationally, already the second-highest annual total in 25 years, and it was noted that 82% were linked to the outbreak in those three states \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF10)\\]. Despite control efforts, the case count continued to rise; as of 29 May 2025, a total of 1,088 measles cases had been confirmed across 33 states \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. Fourteen distinct outbreaks (defined as three or more linked cases) were identified in 2025, though the majority of all cases were associated with the large Texas-centered outbreak. Figure [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#FIG1) depicts the weekly accumulation of cases from 6 January through 30 May 2025, illustrating the rapid March-to-April growth phase and subsequent deceleration.\n\n### Figure 1.

More than 90% of patients were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status (per CDC reports), and many belonged to communities that had resisted routine immunizations. Cases spanned all age groups, but young children were heavily affected: roughly one-third of cases were in children under five (including many infants too young to be vaccinated), another third in school-aged children, and the remainder in adults. About 1 in 10 patients required hospitalization for measles complications or isolation. Most tragically, three measles-related deaths occurred (two children and one immunocompromised adult), the first U.S. measles fatalities in over 20 years \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF12)\\]. Genomic analyses confirmed that the outbreaks stemmed from imported virus strains, not a new endemic variant \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF13)\\]. Notably, travel played a role in amplifying the spread: for instance, several cases in Colorado and Illinois were traced to exposures during domestic airline flights and at tourist destinations \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF14)\\]. These scenarios illustrated how quickly measles can hop between susceptible pockets. As illustrated in Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#FIG2), sustained measles activity in 2025 global hotspots, particularly parts of Europe, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, generated multiple air-travel corridors into major U.S. airports, ultimately funneling cases into the undervaccinated Texas-New Mexico-Oklahoma cluster that seeded the domestic outbreak. Conversely, areas with high vaccination coverage largely escaped secondary transmission, demonstrating the protective value of herd immunity where it remained intact.\n\n### Figure 2. International Measles Transmission Pattern.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b052/12357784/b7a1c69aa296/cureus-0017-00000088196-i02.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12357784_cureus-0017-00000088196-i02.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/figure/FIG2/)\n\nConceptual illustration of measles spread through international air travel. In 2025, imported measles cases (infected travelers arriving in the U.S.) ignited outbreaks in undervaccinated communities. Global travel has linked measles outbreaks across continents, underscoring that high vaccination coverage is needed everywhere to prevent cross-border spread.\n\nImage credit: Ubalaeze Solomon Elechi, created with OpenAI’s GPT-4 and DALL-E tools\n\nComparative Analysis: Affected Versus Unaffected States\n\nAs of 30 May 2025, the three core outbreak states (Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma) recorded a mean incidence of 7.4 cases per million residents, whereas the remaining 47 jurisdictions averaged 0.06 cases per million, a 120-fold difference \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. States in the lowest kindergarten MMR-coverage quartile (≤ 92%) accounted for 87% of all U.S. cases, while no state with ≥ 96% coverage reported more than five cases \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3)\\]. This inverse relationship between coverage and incidence mirrors modeling work showing that every percentage-point drop in two-dose coverage increases outbreak probability by roughly 14% \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF15)\\].\n\nGranular Demographic Breakdown\n\nThe U.S. 2025 cases had a demographic profile of 1,088 individuals. Among line-listed patients, 34% were children under five years of age, 33% were school-aged (5-17 years), and 28% were adults ≥ 18 years; the remaining 5% had age unreported \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. Hospitalization was required for 11% of cases overall, rising to 18% in infants < 12 months. Vaccination status was known for 1,012 patients: 86% were unvaccinated, 7% had received only one MMR dose, and 7% were fully vaccinated, yielding an estimated two-dose effectiveness of 97% against confirmed disease. Sex distribution was balanced (51% male). Racial/ethnic data, available for 62% of cases, showed over-representation of Hispanic/Latino children in the Texas and New Mexico clusters, while non-Hispanic White children predominated in the Oklahoma and Colorado clusters \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\].\n\nVaccine hesitancy: drivers and demographics\n\nMeasles outbreaks in the 21st century have been overwhelmingly linked to clusters of unvaccinated individuals, raising the question: Why are people forgoing a readily available, life-saving vaccine? The drivers of vaccine hesitancy are multifaceted. Foremost is misinformation about vaccine safety, notably the debunked claim linking the MMR vaccine to autism, originally propagated by a fraudulent study in 1998 \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF16)\\]. Fear of autism remains a leading reason cited by parents who refuse MMR for their children. Other parental concerns include perceived risks of vaccine side effects, the belief that “natural” immunity is healthier, and general distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government health agencies. Social media and online echo chambers have amplified vaccine misinformation, allowing anti-vaccine activists to sow doubt about the MMR vaccine’s safety despite an overwhelming scientific consensus of its safety and efficacy. The result has been a measurable decline in public confidence in childhood vaccines in some communities. The WHO identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019 \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF2)\\], acknowledging that complacency and misinformation were undermining decades of progress. In the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic may have further fueled hesitancy; not only did routine pediatric vaccination rates dip during pandemic lockdowns, but polarized debates around COVID-19 vaccines spilled over to routine immunizations, reinforcing doubts among some groups \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF17)\\].\n\nLegacy of the MMR-Autism Myth\n\nPersistent concern that the MMR vaccine causes autism remains the single most frequently cited reason for MMR refusal in U.S. parent surveys \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF18)\\]. Evidence refuting this link is unequivocal: a 2014 population-based meta-analysis of over 1.2 million children found no association between MMR exposure and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF19)\\]. A nationwide Danish cohort study covering 657,461 births likewise reported a null association (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.02) \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF20)\\]. Most recently, an updated U.K. matched-cohort analysis reaffirmed that ASD incidence is identical in vaccinated and unvaccinated children \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF21)\\]. Despite this consensus, online recirculation of the discredited 1998 Wakefield paper continues to seed hesitancy within some communities, indicating the importance of proactive, evidence-based communication strategies.\n\nDemographics\n\nHesitancy is not uniform across the population; it clusters in specific demographics and communities. Paradoxically, areas with higher socioeconomic status and education levels have at times harbored more vaccine-refusing parents. For example, communities in California and Colorado, where “natural lifestyle” movements flourish, saw MMR vaccination rates fall well below 90% before policy changes. In the 2023-2024 school year, the national average MMR coverage for kindergarteners was 92.7%, but this average masks geographic pockets of much lower coverage \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3)\\]. Fourteen U.S. states reported that over 5% of their kindergarten students had non-medical vaccine exemptions in 2023-2024, with the national exemption rate rising to 3.3% \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF22)\\]. These exemptions, often due to personal or religious belief waivers, tend to concentrate in certain schools and communities, creating pockets of susceptibility. Religious or cultural beliefs also play a role: insular religious communities (such as the Amish, some Orthodox Jewish groups, and certain fundamentalist churches) have experienced measles outbreaks after members declined vaccines for faith-related reasons \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF23)\\]. Minority communities can face unique challenges; for instance, Somali-American families in Minnesota were targeted by anti-vaccine misinformation about autism, leading to a dramatic drop in MMR uptake and a subsequent measles outbreak in 2017 within that community \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF23)\\]. Additionally, structural barriers and healthcare access inequalities mean some children miss vaccinations not by choice but due to healthcare system gaps, although the Vaccines for Children program and public health clinics aim to minimize this in the U.S.\n\nThe demographics of the 2025 measles outbreak reflect these hesitancy patterns. Several West Texas counties at the center of the 2025 outbreak have carried kindergarten two-dose MMR coverage well below the 90% threshold for multiple consecutive years: Briscoe County, TX, 80.0%; Childress County, TX, 70.5%; and Dawson County, TX, 88.1%, compared with the 2023-2024 national average of 92.7% \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF24), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF25)\\]. CDC line-list data show that through 17 April 2025, 69% of U.S. measles cases occurred in persons < 20 years of age (38% aged 5-19 years and 31% aged < 5 years), and over 90% of all patients were either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF10), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\], patterns consistent with pockets of routine-immunization refusal in the affected communities. Meanwhile, several adult measles cases in the 2025 outbreak were individuals who had never been vaccinated due to similar beliefs or who missed childhood vaccination and lacked awareness of the need. Ultimately, the outbreak was driven by immunity gaps rather than any change in the virus or the vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy, fueled by fear, misinformation, and sociocultural dynamics, supplied the tinder, and a single imported case ignited an epidemic in these unprotected communities.\n\nPublic health response and economic impact: what worked, what failed\n\nContaining the 2025 outbreaks required a swift and coordinated public health response. Local, state, and federal agencies implemented classic measures: prompt isolation of cases, contact tracing, and targeted vaccination of susceptible contacts and communities \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF26)\\]. Health departments in Texas and neighboring states held emergency immunization clinics and, in affected counties, even recommended an early MMR dose for infants 6-11 months old \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF27)\\]. Schools in outbreak areas excluded unvaccinated students during the incubation period, and public health officials issued travel advisories and alerts to clinicians. These efforts, alongside extensive community outreach, eventually curbed the spread by early summer 2025 \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. As summarized in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#TAB1), the 2025 U.S. outbreak’s scale was comparable to recent high-profile resurgences in Samoa (2019) and the United Kingdom (2018), underscoring how gaps in coverage translate into costly public-health responses.\n\n### Table 1. Key Measles Outbreaks in Recent Years (Selected Examples).\n\nNote: Immunization coverage refers to the estimated national or subnational uptake of the first and/or second dose of MMR vaccine prior to each outbreak. Data were compiled from the CDC and WHO reports. \"Pockets of low coverage\" denote geographic or demographic subgroups with significantly lower-than-average vaccine uptake, which contributed to outbreak vulnerability.\n\nMMR: measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; WHO: World Health Organization; U.S.: United States\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Location (Year) | Cases | Deaths | Immunization Coverage (Pre-outbreak) | Notable Characteristics |\n| United States (2019) | 1,282 | 0 | ~94% nationwide; pockets of low coverage (some communities < 80%) | Largest U.S. measles outbreak since 1992; concentrated in under-vaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities (~75% of cases); elimination status narrowly preserved \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF7)\\]. |\n| United States (2025) | 1,088 | 3 | 92.7% nationwide; local pockets < 70% | Worst U.S. outbreak since 2019 (ongoing); ~90% of cases in unvaccinated persons; includes a major outbreak in West Texas/New Mexico (82% of 2025 cases) \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. |\n| United Kingdom (2018) | 991 | 3 | ~95% (first dose), ~87% (second dose) at school entry | Lost WHO “measles-free” status after a prolonged outbreak reestablished endemic transmission; measles cases doubled from 2017 to 2018, with several fatalities in unvaccinated children \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF8)\\]. |\n| Samoa (2019) | 5,707 | 83 | ~30% (estimated MMR coverage before outbreak) | Nationwide epidemic following a dramatic drop in vaccination; > 80% of deaths in children < 5 years; state of emergency declared with mass vaccination campaign to raise coverage \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF9)\\]. |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/table/TAB1/)\n\nCertain response strategies clearly worked. Rapid case identification through vigilant surveillance and laboratory testing allowed timely interventions. Interagency communication (fortified by pandemic-era coordination frameworks) facilitated resource sharing, and community leaders were engaged to promote vaccination in hesitant populations \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF26)\\]. The fact that measles did not become endemic beyond the initial clusters is a testament to these control measures. However, the outbreak also exposed gaps. Years of inadequate investment in vaccine education meant that by the time officials mobilized messaging in 2025, misinformation was deeply entrenched in the hardest-hit communities \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF28)\\]. Understaffed local health departments struggled with the surge in contact tracing and immunization workloads, reflecting a broader disinvestment in public health infrastructure. Jurisdictional complexities (for example, coordinating quarantine across state lines) at times hampered the speed of response. On 7 March 2025, the CDC issued Health Alert Network Advisory #00522 instructing jurisdictions to isolate suspected cases, trace contacts, and administer post-exposure MMR within 72 hours or immune globulin within six days \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF26), [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF29)\\]. Within a week, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) circulated the same protocol to county health departments \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF30)\\]. Yet rural West Texas counties reported that vaccine stockpiles were depleted and that only one or two immunization nurses were available for surge duty, producing contact-tracing backlogs of 48-60 hours \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF31), [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF32)\\]. The 2022 NACCHO Profile Survey had already found that 51% of U.S. local health departments lacked sufficient staff to manage vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surges \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF33)\\], a gap echoed in Texas after-action reviews. Meanwhile, the CDC’s advisory recommended furlough of exposed but non-immune healthcare workers; several rural hospitals complied yet could not backfill shifts, forcing diversion of febrile-rash patients to distant facilities \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF34)\\]. These examples illustrate how robust federal guidance can be blunted when county-level workforce and vaccine reserves are inadequate \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF28)\\].\n\nThe economic impact of the outbreak was substantial. Measles containment is labor-intensive and costly: each case requires investigation and follow-up of many contacts, and quarantines and public information campaigns carry significant costs. A recent analysis of a 2019 measles outbreak in Washington State estimated an average cost of about $47,000 per measles case (including public health response and productivity losses) \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF35)\\]. Using that figure, more than 1,000 cases in 2025 imposed tens of millions of dollars in societal costs. Most of this expense fell on public health agencies that diverted personnel and resources to the outbreak, as well as on hospitals that treated severe cases. These costs far exceed the investments that would have been needed to maintain high vaccination coverage in the first place, a stark economic argument for prevention \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF36)\\].\n\nVulnerable populations and health disparities\n\nCertain groups suffered disproportionately during the measles resurgence. Infants too young to be vaccinated (under 12 months) were at extreme risk; many of the 2025 cases occurred in babies less than a year old, including one of the fatal cases \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF10)\\]. Children under five years of age in general are highly vulnerable to measles complications like pneumonia and encephalitis; historically, this age group accounts for the majority of measles deaths worldwide \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF37)\\]. In Samoa’s 2019 outbreak, 87% of measles fatalities were in children under five. The 2025 U.S. outbreak reaffirmed this pattern, as young children made up a large share of hospitalizations and the two pediatric deaths.\n\nBeyond age, immunocompromised individuals are another vulnerable population. People who cannot receive live vaccines due to conditions such as leukemia or immunosuppressive therapy rely on herd immunity for protection \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF38)\\]. The death of an adult cancer patient in the 2025 outbreak (who contracted measles from his community) underscores that even a single measles case in the wrong setting can be devastating. Pregnant women are also at elevated risk of severe measles and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although fortunately, no pregnant patients died in 2025 \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF39)\\].\n\nMeasles outbreaks tend to exploit social and economic disparities. Underserved communities with limited healthcare access may have lower vaccination rates not out of intent, but because of practical barriers. Parent interviews in the CDC’s National Immunization Survey identified lack of transportation, inconvenient clinic hours, and childcare costs as common obstacles to keeping vaccine appointments \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF40)\\]. At the same time, several of the worst recent outbreaks (in the U.S. and abroad) have occurred in relatively insular communities (defined by religious or cultural ties) that resist vaccination, regardless of socioeconomic status. Vulnerability to measles is shaped not only by socioeconomic access but also by beliefs and information: California data show personal-belief exemptions cluster in affluent, highly educated communities \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF6), [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF41)\\], while the 2017 Somali-American outbreak in Minnesota stemmed from autism-related vaccine fears despite free clinic availability. In 2025, some rural counties with healthcare provider shortages experienced delayed diagnoses, which allowed wider spread \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF42)\\]. Language and cultural barriers further hampered warning efforts in certain immigrant communities. Addressing these issues requires culturally competent engagement well before outbreaks occur. Ultimately, the presence of measles anywhere reveals which populations have been left behind, whether due to marginalization or misinformation, and those gaps must be closed to protect everyone.\n\nThe persistence of “zero-dose” children, those who have not received even a first dose of any routine vaccine, has become a key global indicator of immunization system fragility \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF43)\\]. The undervaccinated pockets that fueled the 2025 U.S. outbreak function much like zero-dose clusters in low- and middle-income countries, suggesting that domestic dashboards could adopt the same metric to flag communities where measles is most likely to resurge.\n\nLessons learned and policy implications\n\nThe 2025 experience has crystallized several lessons for policymakers and public health practitioners. Foremost, maintaining high vaccination coverage is essential. The reemergence of measles in the U.S. vividly demonstrated that even small declines in community immunity can have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, proactive measures to counter vaccine hesitancy should be a permanent fixture of public health work. Such action includes continuous public education that adapts to evolving misinformation, as well as readily accessible vaccination services.\n\nOne policy implication is the reconsideration of vaccine exemption policies. States with lenient non-medical exemption (NME) rules observed a higher concentration of unvaccinated children \\[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF44)\\], and this outbreak disproportionately affected those clusters. Stricter requirements (for example, only permitting medical exemptions, as California and some other states have done) could be expanded to more jurisdictions. At minimum, simplifying the process for families to vaccinate could help raise immunization rates \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF45)\\]. Schools and daycare centers are critical enforcement points; ensuring they have the mandate and resources to verify student vaccinations and exclude unvaccinated individuals during outbreaks is key.\n\nAnother lesson is the importance of engaging communities and building trust long before health emergencies arise. Combatting misinformation isn’t just about debunking myths in the media; it requires on-the-ground relationships. Local health departments might establish dedicated outreach teams to work with communities known to have lower vaccination rates, partnering with local leaders, clergy, and healthcare providers to deliver consistent pro-vaccine messages \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF46)\\]. Listening and dialogue are as important as messaging in this effort; people’s concerns must be heard and addressed respectfully to rebuild trust. The outbreak showed that trying to change minds in the midst of a crisis is extremely difficult; the groundwork must be laid in advance.\n\nThe outbreak also strengthens the argument for investing in public health infrastructure. The relative containment of measles (it did not become endemic nationwide) was due in part to the rapid mobilization of public health teams. Yet the strain on those teams was apparent: at the height of the response, Texas could field only 2,800 contact tracers, after 400 had been reassigned, against the governor’s target of 4,000 and well below independent estimates of 9,000 to 20,000 needed for statewide control \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF47)\\]. Policymakers should see these findings as evidence that funding stable epidemiology and immunization programs (not just emergency surge funding) is an investment that pays off. Modernizing immunization information systems to better identify pockets of under-vaccination can enable targeted interventions in the future. For example, predictive modeling studies suggest that without improvements, the U.S. could see measles regaining a foothold within a few decades. One recent model estimated that a sustained 10% decline in MMR coverage could lead to over 11 million measles cases in the U.S. over 25 years \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF48)\\]. Such scenarios underscore the urgency of taking preventive actions now.\n\nFinally, there is a global dimension to these lessons. Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere. The U.S. will remain at risk of importation as long as measles circulates globally, so supporting international vaccination efforts (through the WHO, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and other initiatives) aligns with national self-interest \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF37)\\]. The Samoa and UK experiences show that even relatively small populations can generate large outbreaks that reverberate internationally. Thus, recommitting to the global measles elimination agenda is part of the solution; this includes sharing best practices, data, and resources to bolster measles control in every region.\n\nThe 2025 crisis taught us that complacency is dangerous. However, it has also presented an opportunity and acted as a catalyst to fortify policies and programs, ensuring that a disease such as measles doesn't surprise us in the future.\n\nFuture directions and recommendations\n\nThe priority should and must be to translate these lessons into concrete action \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF49)\\]. This review’s findings support several recommendations. First, immunization policy should be updated to ensure more uniform coverage, for instance, by narrowing exemption allowances and considering requirements for documentation of immunity in settings like colleges or healthcare employment \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF38), [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF45)\\]. Second, we recommend enhanced investment in vaccine education and outreach, taking advantage of social media and community networks to spread accurate information and counter myths \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF50)\\]. Programs that train local trusted figures (teachers, religious leaders, etc.) to advocate for vaccination could be expanded \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF49)\\]. Third, innovative solutions to improve vaccine uptake should be pursued: for example, research into needle-free vaccine delivery (such as microneedle patches for measles) could reduce barriers and fear, and integrating vaccination reminders into electronic health records and pharmacy systems could increase convenience \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF51)\\].\n\nIt is also advisable to incorporate checks of measles vaccination status into routine healthcare and public health activities. For instance, pediatricians should consistently review and catch up on immunizations at every visit, and public health programs might organize periodic “vaccination days” in communities with low coverage, offering free MMR shots with minimal red tape.\n\nOn a national preparedness level, establishing rapid response teams specifically for VPD outbreaks could improve reaction time. These teams could be pre-trained and deployed when clusters of measles (or similar diseases) are detected, much like disaster response units.\n\nImplementation should be audited with clear metrics. Nationally, the CDC already tracks two-dose MMR coverage through SchoolVaxView; the Healthy People 2030 benchmark is ≥ 95% in every state \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3), [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF52)\\]. Jurisdictions could add the “7-1-7” timeliness target, detect a cluster within seven days, begin investigation within one day, and complete initial control within seven days as a rapid-response scorecard for VPD outbreaks \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF53)\\]. Health departments could use county-level dashboards that publish real-time kindergarten MMR and exemption percentages from immunization-information-system (IIS) feeds to trigger outreach whenever coverage drops below the 92% herd-immunity threshold.\n\nPolicy experience shows that narrowing NMEs quickly boosts coverage. After California abolished personal-belief exemptions, kindergarten MMR coverage increased from 92.8% to 95.1% in two years \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF45)\\], while Maine’s 2019 repeal of NMEs produced a 4-point gain, with coverage reaching 97% by 2024-2025 \\[ [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF54)\\].\n\nInternationally, the U.S. can lead by example by re-achieving measles elimination and maintaining it \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF49)\\]. This means stopping current outbreaks and building a resilient system that quickly addresses any future importation. It also means continuing to support global measles control, such as contributing to global vaccine stockpiles and outbreak response funds and assisting other countries in strengthening their immunization programs.\n\nIn the end, the direction is clear: prevent, prevent, prevent. The tools to avoid measles outbreaks exist, and the 2025 crisis has reinforced that we must use them proactively. By doing so, we protect not only our communities but also contribute to the global fight against a virus that no longer needs to cause suffering in the 21st century \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF55)\\].\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe 2025 U.S. measles outbreak is a sobering reminder that public health victories are never permanent. When population immunity slips, even slightly, vaccine-preventable diseases regain a foothold. Yet the episode also proved that rapid, well-coordinated public health action can still break chains of transmission before measles becomes endemic again. The task ahead is to convert the lessons learned into stronger policies, sustained outreach, and renewed trust in vaccination so we do not repeat this cycle.\n\nParents’ concerns do not end with disproven autism myths; many remain uneasy about the common, generally mild side effects that follow routine immunization. Addressing those concerns openly and consistently, making side effect profiles part of every informed-consent conversation, has been shown to build confidence rather than erode it. In the future, new methods for administering vaccines, such as microneedle patches or inhaled powders that don't require refrigeration, could make it easier to get vaccinated without needles and help reach people in remote areas. If these methods prove effective, they could help reduce fear and increase vaccination rates. Measles is fully preventable, and the tools to prevent it already exist. It is our collective responsibility to ensure the effective and equitable use of these tools. By doing so, we can turn the setback of 2025 into renewed momentum toward durable measles elimination, protecting today’s children and generations yet to come.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe article's figure preparation was assisted by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and DALL-E tools under the direct supervision of the authors.\n\n## Disclosures\n\n**Conflicts of interest:** In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\n**Payment/services info:** All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n**Financial relationships:** All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\n**Other relationships:** All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\n**Concept and design:**  Adekunle F.

They added that all of the admitted children were unvaccinated.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-nbc20250226-40) Senator [Bill Cassidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cassidy \"Bill Cassidy\"), who chaired the Senate health committee, tweeted that the death was \"absolutely devastating\" and encouraged parents to vaccinate their children.[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-h748-42)[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-43)\n\nInfectious disease experts Cameron Wolfe of [Duke University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University \"Duke University\"), David Higgins of the [University of Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado \"University of Colorado\"), and former head of the National Immunization Program [Walter Orenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Orenstein \"Walter Orenstein\") objected to Kennedy's description of the outbreak as \"not unusual\" and stated the child's death was fully preventable with proper vaccination.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-NYTimesFirstDeath-25)[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-v377-27) [Ali S.

vaccination.[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-h748-42) On March 4, the CDC, which had been providing MMR vaccines and lab support, posted

Health.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-x264-45) The organization also began planning a large-scale study of [vaccines and

vaccination.[\\[51\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-d527-51) Kennedy gave an interview to Fox News' [Marc

After a second child died of measles, Kennedy attended her funeral.[\\[57\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-e430-57) He met with the families of

would follow the state's lead.[\\[58\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-t335-58)\n\nAfterwards Kennedy posted on X that \"the most effective way

it.[\\[58\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-t335-58) He also praised two doctors (Ben Edwards and Richard Barlett) who had treated children with

enforced.[\\[62\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Southwest_United_States_measles_outbreak#cite_note-i193-62) In rural Texas, the challenges of the outbreak were exacerbated by a lack of adequate
