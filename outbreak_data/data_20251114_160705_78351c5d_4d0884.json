This zoonotic disease, native to Central and West Africa, is marked by fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy and is primarily spread through direct contact with infected animals or people and indirectly through contaminated objects. Recent studies have indicated possible sexual transmission, underscoring how human behavior and environmental changes are increasing its prevalence, even though human-to-human transmission is less efficient than that of smallpox. Mpox is endemic in several African countries, and currently, the infection has spread in non-endemic countries, including Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya. Democratic Republic of Congo is the epicenter of the current Mpox outbreak. From January 1, 2022, to August 6, 2024, sixteen African countries reported Mpox outbreak. Several factors, including population immunity deficiencies and changes to the environment and ecology, have led to the widespread of Mpox in Africa. Challenges such as the fragile healthcare system, limited vaccine availability and access, weak surveillance, and low public awareness poses difficulty in containing the infection in affected countries. Given the potential of Mpox to disrupt several sectors including health systems, which may ultimately reverse progress in achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030. It is imperative for countries, both within and outside Africa, to extend financial aid and human resources to combat the infection effectively.\n\n## Introduction\n\nHistorically known as Monkeypox, Mpox is an endemic zoonotic disease mostly found in parts of Central and West Africa and is characterized by fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy, among other symptoms. Mpox was first identified in 1958 \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref001), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref002)\\]; the first human case was reported in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref003)\\]. Since that time (1970s), there have been sporadic outbreaks with an increasing trend in incidence and geographical spread over the past months. The Mpox pathogen is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or humans and indirectly by contact with fomites \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref004)– [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref006)\\]. In recent times, there have been reports of sexual transmission of Mpox \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref007)– [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref009)\\]. Human transmission of Mpox is inefficient compared to smallpox, but changes in human behavior and environmental factors make such a transmission pattern more common. The role of animal reservoirs, especially rodents and small primates, is crucial in preventing the transmission of the Mpox virus in nature. However, there remains limited evidence on the role of animal reservoirs and sexual transmission in spreading Mpox. Understanding the specific animal species that act as reservoirs is crucial for predicting and preventing spillover events. Additionally, clarifying the mechanisms and prevalence of sexual transmission is essential for developing targeted public health interventions. Addressing these gaps will enhance our ability to control and eventually eliminate Mpox in affected countries and by extension regions.\n\n## Current Mpox situation in Africa compared with other regions\n\nMpox is endemic in several African countries. From January 1, 2022, to August 6, 2024, sixteen African countries reported laboratory-confirmed Mpox virus cases ( [Fig 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.g001)) \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref010)\\], with a total of 2030 confirmed cases and 13 deaths \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref007)– [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref009)\\]. There have never been any historically reported Mpox case for many of these countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. To date, African countries have recorded more confirmed and suspected Mpox cases (a total of 17,500) in 2024 than in 2023 (a total of 15,000) \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref011), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref012)\\]. The DRC is the epicenter of the current Mpox outbreak in Africa \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref013)\\], and the majority of the Mpox cases in Africa in 2024 so far have been children ≤15 years. In the DRC, this sub-population accounts for two-thirds of Mpox incidence \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref014)\\]. The spread of the virus in these countries is largely blamed on the ongoing conflict in the region, which has resulted in the mass displacement of civilians across their different borders. Other critical challenges to curtailing the Mpox outbreak in Africa include limited healthcare infrastructures compounded with limited medical supplies and professionals, community beliefs in seeking healthcare from traditional healers, and limited funding \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref015)\\]. Worth noting that Ghana has no history of Mpox outbreaks; however, the country was identified in 2003 as the source of a shipment of wild mammals that led to Mpox outbreak in US that year.\n\n### Fig 1. Distribution of Mpox cases in Africa, 2022–August 2024.\n\n[![Fig 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/23d4/12161565/a86be763f2de/pntd.0013148.g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12161565_pntd.0013148.g001.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/figure/pntd.0013148.g001/)\n\nIn September 2023, a new Mpox variant (clade 1b) emerged in the eastern DRC \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref014)\\] which shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda. Rwanda, Uganda, and most recently, Kenya have reported cases of the new Mpox variant \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref011)\\]. Four countries: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda with no previous outbreaks of Mpox have reported cases since mid-July 2024. Epidemiological data from these countries indicates an increasing trend of Mpox cases in the past few months; this increase may be attributed to environmental and ecological changes, improved surveillance, and a waning level of population immunity following the cessation of smallpox vaccination programs.\n\nCompared to other regions globally ( [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.t001)), like Europe, specifically the United Kingdom, ranks in the eighth position worldwide regarding the burden of Mpox \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref016)\\]. Most cases occur among men who identify as gay or bisexual or men who have sex with men, with transmission mainly occurring through close skin contact \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref016)\\]. This pattern highlights the importance of targeted public health measures and awareness efforts to curb the spread within these communities. Similar patterns were also observed in North America, like Canada, where most of the cases occur among men who have sex with men, and the primary route of transmission is reported through sexual intercourse \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref017)\\].\n\n### Table 1. Differences in the epidemiology of the African Mpox outbreak with other regions.\n\n| Dimensions | Africa | Other regions |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Epidemiology | Predominantly zoonotic, with sporadic outbreaks linked to wildlife exposure. | Human-to-human transmission is more prevalent, particularly among specific communities. |\n| Transmission | Primarily through contact with infected animals and consumption of bushmeat. | Close human contact, including sexual contact, is the primary mode of transmission. |\n| Affected population | Rural communities with proximity to wildlife. | Men who have sex with men (MSM) and urban populations. |\n| Public health interventions | Focus on wildlife management and educating communities about risks. | Targeted awareness campaigns and vaccination strategies for high-risk groups. |\n| Challenges | Limited healthcare infrastructure and surveillance systems. | Stigma and misinformation affecting intervention efforts. |\n| Vaccination | Limited access to vaccines; reliance on preventive measures. | Availability of vaccines and implementation of vaccination campaigns. |\n| Surveillance | Often reactive, with challenges in timely outbreak detection. | More robust systems in place for monitoring and response. |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/table/pntd.0013148.t001/)\n\n## Current public health response\n\n### Vaccination\n\nThe global Mpox response varies by country, with the majority focusing on vaccination, contact tracing, quarantine, and public education. Most Mpox vaccination campaigns and activities revolve around the use of the smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000) and the newer MVA-BN vaccine. Despite the success of using smallpox vaccination to prevent the spread of Mpox elsewhere. In Africa, the large geographic landscape coupled with vaccine hesitancy, culture, the presence of armed conflict, low vaccine supply, and other logistical challenges involving the supply chain, pose a major challenge to Mpox vaccination effort.\n\n### Contact tracing and quarantine\n\nContact tracing and quarantine of cases are the commonly used strategy implemented by African countries to control and manage the spread of Mpox outbreaks. However, like the case of the vaccination effort, contact tracing and quarantine are also being hampered by many challenges, including a weak healthcare infrastructure, insufficient funds, and the vast and remote geographical areas of the affected regions.\n\n### Public awareness\n\nVarious African countries and organizations have launched campaigns, and awareness-raising activities to educate their communities about Mpox, mostly targeting the disease transmission mode, prevention strategies, early recognition of its symptoms, and the significance of seeking early treatment. However, like the prevention of most diseases in Africa, misinformation and cultural beliefs continue to pose significant barriers to these public awareness efforts.\n\n### International collaboration and support\n\nRecently, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the World Health Organization have collaboratively implemented strategic initiatives to enhance public health response capabilities in the African continent. These initiatives include establishing a unified framework titled “One budget, one plan, and one monitoring and evaluation framework,” alongside creating the “One Continental Incident Management Support” \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref018)\\]. Through these coordinated efforts, Africa CDC is actively disseminating routine updates on outbreak situations, which facilitates informed decision-making and enhances awareness regarding epidemiological trends and patterns of Mpox across member states.\n\nAdditionally, these initiatives have led to the successful procurement of 20,000 mpox cartridges to bolster diagnostic testing capabilities throughout member states. In response to the acute needs in Burundi and the DRC, which are among the most affected countries, Africa CDC, in partnership with UNICEF, has allocated $58 million USD in humanitarian aid aimed at supporting children and marginalized groups \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref019)\\]. These comprehensive measures underscore the commitment to strengthening health systems and mitigating the impacts of ongoing outbreaks in the region.\n\n## Challenges and opportunities\n\n### Challenges\n\n- **Healthcare infrastructure:** Many African countries lack the robust healthcare infrastructure needed for effective Mpox surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment. To compound this problem, most of the areas severely affected by Mpox in Africa are remote regions; rural and remote areas are mostly underserved in Africa.\n\n- **Public awareness:** Like most other diseases with outbreak potential, there is a low level of public awareness about Mpox which contributes to its delayed diagnosis and treatment. Low public awareness increases the risk of severe treatment outcomes and viral transmission.\n\n- **Access to vaccines:** One of the greatest challenge to the ongoing control and management of the Mpox outbreak in Africa is the limited access to smallpox vaccines, both in terms of supply and distribution. Also, because Clade 1 Mpox strains are sexually transmissible, identifying adults at risk for Mpox vaccination. One last mile for accessing the Mpox vaccine effort in African countries is how to design vaccine programs to target at-risk children. In the current Mpox outbreak in Africa, the children at risk are mostly ≤5 years old, which will require the design of Mpox vaccine program for children <2 years. This is coupled with the likelihood that the parents of those at-risk children will accept vaccination for their kids given the non-existence of data on the use of such vaccine in this subpopulation.\n\n- **Need for epidemiological study:** There remains a gap in knowledge about the growing trend of Mpox in the current outbreak that requires further investigation. There is a growing incidence of childhood Mpox cases being reported in the current outbreak, thus making the need to investigate the source of childhood Mpox transmission.\n\n- **Socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors:** Multiple studies have highlighted several factors deterring the containment of the ongoing Mpox outbreak. In the DRC, research has identified specific socio-cultural and environmental determinants. The predominant occupation of residents as farmers, alongside traditional practices involving rodent hunting among youth and children, overcrowded living conditions, and communal use of household utensils, significantly increase the risk of Mpox transmission \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref020)– [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref022)\\]. Additionally, Olawade and colleagues reported that deforestation, agricultural expansion, urbanization, and climate change are critical factors exacerbating human- wildlife interactions, potentially leading to zoonotic transmission of Mpox in Africa \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref023)\\]. The study emphasized that climatic changes alter rainfall patterns and ecological conditions, influencing the distribution of animal reservoirs and the Mpox virus, thereby facilitating outbreaks \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref023)\\]. In Nigeria, a study reported that low political support, characterized by chronic underfunding, misadministration, and high healthcare costs, impedes successful Mpox containment efforts \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref024)\\]. McNab and colleagues further noted the neglect by political leaders in providing necessary funding, logistics, treatment, and vaccines as major barriers to containment efforts in the African region \\[ [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref025)\\]. The authors advocated for increased political attention and leadership at national, regional, and global levels, urging member states and the WHO to implement International Health Regulations (IHR), increase funding, supply vaccines, and enhance community engagement as strategies to curb the spread \\[ [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12161565/#pntd.0013148.ref025)\\].\n\n- **Limited funding:** The absence of dedicated funding for the Mpox response presents a major challenge to the implementation of essential prevention and control measures. Currently, several African countries lack a dedicated financial support for outbreak management. In instances where funding is available, it is often insufficient to effectively sustain response activities. Consequently, this pose difficulties in proactively implementing outbreak preparedness and response interventions necessary to timely halt or mitigate the spread of the infection.\n\n\n### Opportunities\n\n- **Strengthening surveillance:** The topmost priority in the control and management of the current Mpox outbreak in Africa is the enhancement of disease surveillance, especially in rural areas. This could lead to earlier detection of cases, leading to a robust and effective outbreak response.\n\n- **Capacity building:** African countries and their international partners should invest in their healthcare infrastructure, increase training of public health personnel, and provide the crucial resources that will improve their ability to respond to Mpox outbreaks in real-time to stop it spread.\n\n- **International collaboration:** The fight to stop the expansion of the current Mpox outbreak in Africa should not be an African struggle. The current Mpox outbreak and its expansion call for African countries to establish new partnerships and collaborations, as well as extend existing ones. This will enable their governments to facilitate the sharing of resources, expertise, and vaccines that will invariably lead to improving the overall response to mpox in Africa.\n\n\n## Global implications\n\nThe limited vaccine availability and access, low public awareness, movements of people, and poor healthcare infrastructure within African countries make it difficult to curtail the infection. This poses a high risk of transmission globally. The widespread Mpox infection would not only result in high mortality and morbidity but would also disrupt several other activities including travel restrictions and slowing economic growth. Considering the weak immunity of children, becoming infected with Mpox as seen in the affected African countries, would increase their vulnerability to many other infections. Consequently, this will result in a high fatality rate, thereby reducing the continent’s future generation with a high potential of contributing to economic growth within Africa and beyond. The ongoing conflict in many countries globally poses a high risk of Mpox transmission, as evidenced in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The emergence of Mpox in those countries will be extremely fatal, especially since their healthcare system is disrupted by the ongoing war. With the rapid spread of Mpox across the African continent, non-endemic countries must enhance their preparedness measures to prevent the importation of the Mpox virus. Key strategies include training healthcare workers, particularly those in border communities, on Mpox case detection and providing logistical support alongside establishing isolation units at designated health facilities, particularly in border communities. Similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of Mpox in non-endemic countries could increase the vulnerability of populations, especially children, to vaccine-preventable diseases and limit access to essential medical services, thereby elevating morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, the outbreak may reduce the productivity of healthcare workers, who would be overburdened with the provision of essential healthcare services.\n\n## Policy recommendations\n\nBreaking the chain of Mpox transmission in Africa requires a multipronged approach. African countries should heighten public awareness campaign activities, solicit support for Mpox vaccines, train healthcare workers on Mpox case definitions, and enhance surveillance. Governments should provide funds to their respective public health institutes/agencies to heighten preparedness and response efforts. To ensure the swift distribution of Mpox vaccines, African countries should prioritize procurement and mandate vaccination for high-risk groups, including healthcare workers. Integrating Mpox vaccination into routine immunization programs is essential, with a focus on optimizing supply and cold chain systems, particularly in rural areas. The deployment of community health workers (CHWs) is crucial for effective vaccine distribution in remote regions and for enhancing social mobilization to boost vaccine uptake. Moreover, funding from government and international partners should support public health researchers in conducting groundbreaking studies to investigate the transmission patterns of Mpox related to sexual intercourse and identify the virus’s reservoir. Qualitative research in countries without known Mpox transmission is needed to understand the factors behind successful prevention, which can inform strategies to prevent future outbreaks in both endemic and non-endemic regions. Finally, a community-focused care framework is recommended, emphasizing the involvement of CHWs and stakeholders like religious and traditional leaders, youth, and women’s groups. Leveraging local resources and knowledge through this framework enhances vaccine distribution and social mobilization, which are crucial for controlling the outbreak and preventing further transmission.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChildren make up the majority of those infected with Mpox, which is endemic in several African countries and has a high fatality rate. Several factors, including population immunity deficiencies and changes to the environment and ecology, have led to the widespread of Mpox in the African continent. Challenges such as the fragile healthcare system, limited vaccine availability and access, weak surveillance, and low public awareness make it difficult for the containment of the infection in affected countries. Because Mpox has the potential to disrupt the functioning of every sector globally, non-affected countries within and beyond Africa must provide support (financial and human resources) to fight against the infection.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\n### :\n\nDRC\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\n\nMpox\n\nmonkey pox\n\nMSM\n\nmen who have sex with men\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThe authors received no specific funding for this work.\n\n## References\n\n- 1.Fenner F, Henderson DA, Arita I, Jezek Z, Ladnyi ID.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains one of the countries most affected. Understanding the risk factors for disease transmission from a One Health perspective is of great importance in the risk assessment, prevention, and control of zoonotic diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the risk factors for human mpox transmission at the human–animal–environment interface in the DRC.\n\n### Methods\n\nEpidemiological, environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural data from the DRC from 2000 to 2015 were obtained from publicly available dataset. Using these data, we applied negative binomial regression model, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify key environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural factors contributing to mpox transmission. Moreover, a grey prediction model GM (1, n) was constructed to predict the epidemic trend of mpox post-2015 and validated using suspected mpox case data in the DRC from 2016 to 2021, sourced from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n### Results\n\nBetween 2000 and 2021, a total of 43,628 suspected mpox cases were reported in the DRC, with a peak of 6216 cases in 2020. From 2016 to 2021, suspected cases accounted for over half (24,379/43,628, 55.9%) of the total reported during the 2000–2021 period. The proportion of primary forest \\[incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.023, 95% confidence interval ( _CI_): 1.018–1.027\\], index of economic well-being (IRR: 1.046, 95% _CI_: 1.039–1.052), and mean annual precipitation (IRR 1.040, 95% _CI:_ 1.031–1.049) were positively associated with mpox incidence. PCA identified five principal components, explaining 69% of the variance in the environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural variables. The first component was characterized by socioeconomic factors. The GM (1, n) model, based on the proportion of primary forest, index of economic well-being, and mean annual precipitation, predicted the epidemic trend (revealed relative error: 2.69).\n\n### Conclusions\n\nBoth socioeconomic and environmental factors play important roles in mpox transmission. Our study further highlighted the importance of considering the interconnectedness among humans, animals, and the environment, and treating these factors as a whole to explain the transmission and emergence of mpox outbreaks in the DRC according to the One Health concept.\n\n## Background\n\nHuman monkeypox (mpox) is a viral zoonosis caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). MPXV infection is typically transmitted to humans through spill-over events from animals, including rodents, squirrels, and non-human primates \\[ [1](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9#ref-CR1 \"Mitjà O, Ogoina D, Titanji BK, Galvan C, Muyembe JJ, Marks M, et al.

Moreover, LASSO regression can minimize the prediction error of continuous dependent variables by imposing constraints on the model parameters that cause the regression coefficients of certain predictor variables to decrease to zero.

Generally, the grey prediction model is written as GM (m, n), where “m” is the order, and “n” is the number of variables in the modeling equation.. GM (1, 1) is one of the basic models of grey prediction, and the GM (1, n) model has the characteristics of including the driving effects among each influencing factor. The GM (1, n) model is a special grey prediction model. It performs prediction by dividing the time-series data into several grey systems, where “1” is the order of the differential equation, and “n” is the number of variables.\n\nThe GM (1, n) model was applied to predict the epidemic trend of mpox in the DRC using Python 3.12.1 (the Python Software Foundation, Beaverton, USA). Epidemiological data, alongside environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural variables collected from 2000 to 2015 in the DRC, were input into the GM (1, n) model to predict the number of suspected mpox cases from 2016 to 2023. Additionally, the predicted number of suspected mpox cases from 2016 to 2023 in the DRC was compared with the actual reported data from 2016 to 2021. This comparison was made to evaluate the consistency between the predicted and actual values. Such a way of validation was expected to better show the performance of the model. The construction of the GM (1, n) model is described below.\n\nWith original time-series data,\n\nxi(0)=(xi(0)(1),xi(0)(2),⋯,xi(0)(n)).\n\nThe original sequence xi(0) is first- accumulating to form xi(1)\n\nxi(1)(k)=∑i=1lxi(0)(l)\n\ni=1,2,⋯,n;l=1,2,⋯,k.\n\nThe x1(1) adjacent mean sequence z1(1) is generated as follows:\n\nz1(1)(k)=0.5×(x1(1)(k)+x1(1)(k−1))\n\nThe GM (1, n) model is constructed using the following one-order linear differential equation:\n\nx1(0)(k)+az1(1)(k)=∑i=2Nbixi(1)(k)\n\nIn the above formula, a is the development coefficient, which represents the development trend of the original series; b (the driving coefficient) reflects the relationship of change between system data. The values of a and b were estimated using the least squares method; the data were re-reduced by first-order subtraction to obtain the predicted value of the sequence.\n\n## Results\n\nOver the period 2000–2021, a total of 43,628 suspected mpox cases were reported in the DRC (Fig. [3](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9#Fig3)). The number of suspected mpox cases reached the peak in 2020, with 6216 cases. The number of suspected cases from 2016 to 2021 accounted for over half the total number of cases reported over the study period in the DRC (24,379/43,628, 55.9%). Since 2016, the number of suspected mpox cases reported annually has been always higher than the number of cases in any individual year from 2000 to 2015.\n\n**Fig. 3**\n\n[![figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40249-025-01278-9/MediaObjects/40249_2025_1278_Fig3_HTML.png)](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9/figures/3)\n\nThe trend of suspected human mpox cases reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2000 to 2021\n\n[Full size image](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9/figures/3)\n\n### Risk factors associated with mpox transmission\n\n#### NB regression model\n\nThe proportion of primary forest (IRR: 1.023, 95% _CI_: 1.018–1.027), index of economic well-being (IRR: 1.046, 95% _CI_: 1.039–1.052), and mean annual precipitation (IRR: 1.040, 95% _CI_: 1.031–1.049) were positively associated with the incidence of mpox in the NB regression model (Table [2](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9#Tab2)). The IRR values can be interpreted as follows: a 1% increase in the area covered by primary forest in an HZ will result in a 2.3% increase in the mpox incidence rate; a 1% increase in the proportion of households in the lowest index of economic well-being quintile in an HZ will lead to a 4.6% increase in the mpox incidence rate; and a 1% increase in precipitation in an HZ will result in a 4.0% increase in the mpox incidence rate.\n\n**Table 2 Environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural variables associated with the incidence of mpox in the DRC from 2000 to 2015**\n\n[Full size table](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9/tables/2)\n\n#### LASSO regression model\n\nThe LASSO regression algorithm in tenfold cross-validation identified that three factors had a significantly positive effect on the incidence of mpox, namely the proportion of primary forest, index of economic well-being, and mean annual precipitation (Fig. [4](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9#Fig4)). The output of the LASSO regression model provided the following coefficients: 2.098, 1.811, 0.605. Moreover, two environmental variables were negatively correlated with the incidence of mpox, namely the mean altitude and average river density.

Among these, the first principal component explained approximately 20% of the variance in all variables. The dominant variables in the first principal component were the number of nurses per 10,000 inhabitants, number of physicians per 100,000 inhabitants, index of economic well-being, and density of the population. The mean annual temperature, mean altitude, and average river density were the dominant variables for component 2 (18%). The mean annual precipitation, proportion of primary forest, and late bushfires were the dominant variables for component 3 (15%). The proportion of rivers or watercourses and average road density were the dominant variables for component 4 (9%), and early bushfires were the dominant variables for component 5 (7%).\n\n**Table 3 Five principal components obtained after varimax rotation within the environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural variables**\n\n[Full size table](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9/tables/3)\n\n### Establishment and validation of the GM (1, n)-based prediction model for mpox incidence\n\nThe reported number of suspected mpox cases and all environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural variables from 2000 to 2015 in the DRC were taken as an original time series to build the prediction model for mpox, viz., GM (1, n) prediction model 1 (Fig. [5](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9#Fig5) A). Moreover, the reported number of suspected mpox cases, proportion of primary forest, index of economic well-being, and mean annual precipitation from 2000 to 2015 in the DRC were used as an original time series to build GM (1, n) prediction model 2 (Fig. [5](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9#Fig5) B).\n\n**Fig. 5**\n\n[![figure 5](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs40249-025-01278-9/MediaObjects/40249_2025_1278_Fig5_HTML.png)](https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-025-01278-9/figures/5)\n\nResults and fitting of the GM (1, n) prediction model.

A comparison of the actual reported number of suspected mpox cases from 2016 to 2021 with the results of GM (1, n) prediction models 1 and 2 showed that although there appeared to be a slight underestimation of mpox cases by GM (1, n) prediction model 1 from 2018 to 2020, GM (1, n) prediction model 2 (with the reported number of suspected mpox cases, proportion of primary forest, index of economic well-being, and mean annual precipitation) showed good performance in predicting the incidence of mpox. The relative error (RE) was used to evaluate the models’ performance. The RE of prediction models l and 2 was 2.71 and 2.69, respectively.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUnderstanding the risk factors of mpox transmission through the One Health concept offers an effective means for the prevention and control of the disease.

The NB and LASSO regression models showed that the incidence of mpox in the DRC was positively associated with the proportion of primary forest, index of economic well-being, and mean annual precipitation. The PCA identified five principal components that explained 69% of the variance in the environmental, socioeconomic, and sociocultural variables. Finally, the established GM (1, n) model, which was used to predict the epidemic trend of mpox, using the reported number of suspected mpox cases, proportion of primary forest, index of economic well-being, and mean annual precipitation, effectively predicted the epidemic trend.\n\nInterestingly, our study demonstrated that socioeconomic factors had the most important role in mpox transmission.

Our study further highlighted that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are linked and must be treated as a whole to explain and address the transmission and emergence of mpox outbreaks in the DRC, in line with the concept of One Health.\n\n## Availability of data and materials\n\nData sources and links have been explained in the manuscript.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nMpox:\n\nMonkeypox\n\nMPXV:\n\nMonkeypox virus\n\nDRC:\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nPHEIC:\n\nPublic health emergency of international concern\n\nHZ:\n\nHealth zone\n\nGLMM:\n\nGeneralized linear mixed model\n\nLASSO:\n\nLeast absolute shrinkage and selection operator\n\nNB:\n\nNegative binomial\n\nIRRs:\n\nIncidence rate ratios\n\n_CI_ s:\n\nConfidence intervals\n\nPCA:\n\nPrincipal component analysis\n\nGM:\n\nGrey model\n\nRE:\n\nRelative error\n\n## References\n\n01.

Three years later, the world is seeing two very different realities: one in Africa, where the virus is surging, and another in the rest of the world, where transmission has slowed but risks remain.\n\n**Africa: A growing public health crisis**\n\nAcross Africa, mpox has become a major epidemic. Between January 2024 and May 2025, 26 African countries reported more than 139,000 suspected cases, including 34,824 confirmed infections and roughly 1,788 deaths. Disturbingly, over 21,000 of these confirmed cases occurred in the first few months of 2025 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Malawi are now at the epicenter. (1, 2)\n\nWhat worries researchers most is the rise of a new clade 1a variant carrying APOBEC3 mutations. These mutations may increase the virus’s ability to spread and adapt, raising concerns about whether mpox could become harder to control. Unlike the 2022–2023 outbreak — which was largely driven by clade IIb and linked to sexual networks in non-endemic countries — clade I variants in Africa are spreading more broadly, affecting children, rural communities and health care workers. (3, 4)\n\nWeak health systems, ongoing conflicts and reduced international funding have all hampered early detection and response. Many cases go undiagnosed because diagnostic labs are few and far between. Vaccination efforts remain limited: About 700,000 people have been vaccinated in 11 countries, a fraction of what is needed. (1, 5)\n\n**Outside Africa: A fragile calm**\n\nIn the rest of the world, the picture is calmer but not risk-free. The clade IIb strain that drove the 2022–2023 outbreak continues to circulate at low levels, mostly in specific sexual and social networks. Public health campaigns, targeted vaccination and community engagement have helped bring these numbers down. (3, 4)\n\nHowever, the virus has not disappeared. Since 2023, small numbers of travel-related clade I cases have been reported in the U.K., Thailand, Germany, India, Sweden, the United States and elsewhere. Thankfully, these imported cases have not yet led to sustained community transmission, but they highlight the ongoing risk of spillover from Africa. For this reason, the World Health Organization continues to monitor mpox closely, recognizing that while it is no longer classified as a public health emergency of international concern, the risk of international spread persists. (1, 5, 16)\n\n**Vaccines and treatments: Where we stand**\n\nThe good news is that we are not defenseless. The main vaccine against mpox is the non-replicating Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, known as JYNNEOS in the United States, Imvanex in Europe and Imvamune in Canada. (6) It has also been authorized in Switzerland, Singapore, Nigeria and the DRC. This vaccine has been a cornerstone of both pre-exposure and post-exposure protection during outbreaks.\n\nOlder vaccines, like ACAM2000 — a live, replicating smallpox vaccine — are still available in the U.S. and Canada, but because they can cause more side effects, they are generally used only when safer options are unavailable. Japan continues to use its long-standing LC16 smallpox vaccine. (6)\n\nOn the treatment front, tecovirimat, or TPOXX, remains the leading antiviral option. It is authorized for mpox in the EU, U.K., and Canada, and is available in the United States through an expanded-access program. (7,8) However, recent clinical trial data (STOMP and PALM 007) show that tecovirimat does not consistently shorten the course of illness or relieve symptoms in mild-to-moderate cases, particularly when given late in the disease. Its greatest potential benefit appears to be in early treatment of severe disease, immunocompromised patients or those with extensive lesions. Other antivirals — brincidofovir and cidofovir, both originally developed for other viral infections — are occasionally used off-label in severe or complicated cases, sometimes together with vaccinia immune globulin for added immune support. (9, 10) Despite these options, no drug is yet formally licensed specifically for mpox, meaning that clinical care continues to rely heavily on supportive management: pain control, hydration, nutrition and prevention of secondary infections.\n\nThe pipeline of new tools is expanding. Moderna is developing an mRNA-based mpox vaccine that has shown strong protection in animal studies, and several biotech companies are exploring new antivirals and combination treatments aimed at improving outcomes and preventing drug resistance. (11, 12)\n\n**Preparing for the future**\n\nExperts agree that mpox is a wake-up call for how the world deals with emerging infectious diseases. Strengthening surveillance is essential: This means investing in genomic sequencing, improving diagnostic capacity in low-resource settings and connecting data to global early warning systems.\n\nEquitable access to vaccines and medicines must also be a priority, supported by stockpiles, regional manufacturing hubs and streamlined regulatory approval. Research needs to push forward with broad orthopoxvirus vaccines and better therapeutics. (13, 14)\n\nBeyond the laboratory, community engagement is crucial. Stigma-free education campaigns can encourage people to seek testing and care early. A One Health approach, which links human and animal health surveillance, is vital to prevent the virus from spreading to new animal reservoirs. (14,15)\n\nFinally, countries should regularly test their preparedness with simulation exercises and invest in sustainable financing for outbreak response. Mpox is not gone. The window to act is now — before the next orthopoxvirus crisis catches the world off guard.\n\n_Image: Colorized transmission electron micrograph of mpox virus particles (blue) cultivated and purified from cell culture.

Well-coordinated and synchronized efforts are necessary to understand the factors involved in disease transmission and develop effective health interventions. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between climate factors and daily mpox cases, as well as to identify the most suitable predictive model for transmission. We analyzed confirmed mpox cases from May 5, 2022, to February 14, 2023, in the 33 most affected countries. We employed and compared the efficiency of four models: Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial. We found a significant correlation between climate factors and daily mpox cases across most of the studied countries. Specifically, for each 1°C increase in the heat index (HI), daily cases increased by 7.7 % (IRR = 1.077, p < 0.05). Conversely, higher relative humidity (RH) decreased daily cases by 2.4 %, and increased wind speed (WS) reduced them by 7.3 %. The HI positively influences mpox spread, while RH and WS act as protective factors. Public health officials should consider these climate influences when developing targeted interventions.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in humans was first detected and reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the early 1970s (Marennikova et al., 1972)1. Historically, the disease's mortality rate was around 0–11 %, and it has been approximately 3–6 % in recent times (WHO, 2022a)2. Between January and July 2022, more than 16,000 cases and 5 deaths were reported in 75 countries. The situation worsened in the first half of July, with a 166 % increase in new cases (9989) and two additional deaths (WHO, 2022b)3. On July 23, 2022, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the mpox outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern due to the severity of the situation (WHO, 2022c)4. Overall, the global outbreak of mpox has resulted in 85,860 cases and 93 deaths so far, with the United States (29,974), Brazil (7533), France (4128), Colombia (4074), Mexico (3828), Peru (3737), United Kingdom (3735), Germany (3692), and Canada (1460) being the top ten countries with the most cases reported (WHO, 2023)5.\n\nThe rapid spread of mpox cases across countries has raised serious concerns among public health officials around the world, resulting in accelerated efforts to identify the origins and causes of the rapid expansion of cases. The transmission of infectious diseases is determined by many factors, including social, economic, and ecological conditions, access to health care, and intrinsic human immunity (Saker et al., 2004, Van Seventer and Hochberg, 2017)6–7. Many infectious agents, vector organisms, non-human reservoir species, and pathogen replication rates are particularly sensitive to climatic conditions (Baker et al., 2022)8. Numerous theories have been developed in recent years to explain the relationship between climate change and infectious diseases: they include higher proliferation and reproduction rates at higher temperatures, extended transmission season, changes in ecological balances, and climate-related migration of vectors, reservoir hosts, or human populations (Boeger et al., 2022, Romanello et al., 2022, Semenza and Menne, 2009, Sweileh, 2022)9–12. Environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall have frequently been shown to significantly influence infectious diseases (Koelle et al., 2005) 13. Moreover, distinct seasonal patterns of Mpox transmission have been observed, suggesting a potential link between climate variability and the risk of Mpox transmission (Besombes et al., 2024) 14.\n\nGiven the global impact of COVID-19, concerns about another mpox pandemic are understandable. It is crucial to assess the risk of mpox and take preventive measures to minimize the possibility of a large-scale outbreak. It is important to take advantage of statistical analysis, as it can help in predicting disease spread, identifying factors that contribute to disease transmission, and predicting the future course of an outbreak. It plays a significant role in understanding the burden and dynamics of infectious diseases, and identifying risk factors such as demographic characteristics, behaviors, or environmental factors (Chen et al., 2022, Li et al., 2022, Nicholson et al., 2022)15–17. This information can be used to develop targeted interventions to reduce risk and prevent transmission. In addition, one of the key tools in statistical modeling is the use of regression analysis (Fox, 2015)18, which allows researchers to explore relationships between different responsible variables and estimate their effect of potential factors on the spread of infectious diseases. On the same lines, a number of researchers investigated the effect of climate factors on different infectious diseases (Briz-Redón and Serrano-Aroca, 2020; Kaestli et al., 2016; Prata et al., 2020; Shakil et al., 2020; Su, 2008)19–23.\n\nClimate change influences meteorological factors including temperature, PRE, wind, and sunshine variations that may affect the survival, reproduction, or distribution of disease pathogens and their hosts (Wu et al., 2016)24. Correlating the emergence or increased range of infectious diseases with climate change is still not possible due to a dearth of longitudinal, quality data sets and sociodemographic factors (Patz et al., 2005)25. Still, ample evidence has shown that climate change results in long-term shifts in weather conditions and patterns of extreme weather events, both of which may threaten human health and well-being (Aguirre and Tabor, 2008; Patz et al., 2005)25, 26.\n\nThe current literature relating to mpox is limited, and most known work focuses on clinical trials but not on estimating and modeling the new cases pattern in the major affected countries where outbreaks seriously occurred or occurred. The existing research has focused on topics such as determining the population who is most at risk, and the factors increasing the risk of infection. Additionally, our study employed the use of HI as opposed to air temperature, which provides a more comprehensive assessment of the perceived temperature and its impact on human health by considering the combination of humidity and air temperature (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2014)27. To the best of our knowledge, the use of HI has not been reported in previous studies examining the relationship between meteorological factors and mpox incidence and is very rare in the context of other infectious diseases.\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to investigate the association between meteorological factors and daily mpox cases in the 33 most affected countries. A secondary objective was to identify the most appropriate statistical model to capture the dynamics of mpox disease, identify potential control measures, and inform public health policies.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Data sources\n\n**Mpox data**: The data for this article was extracted from the official website of Our World in Data, which is freely accessible (Mathieu et al., 2022)28. Globally, all reported mpox cases between May 5, 2022, and February 14, 2023, were extracted. The data records information about patients who tested positive in all countries. For this study, we selected countries with more than 100 reported cases, resulting in a selection of 33 countries.\n\n**Climate data:** Meteorological data for this study was\n\n## Exploratory data analysis\n\nFig. 1 illustrates the total number of daily cases per country during the period considered. Overall, the USA was the most affected with 29,974 infected individuals, while Ghana had the least number of reported cases. In North America, the USA had the highest number of reported cases, whereas Panama had the lowest. Brazil was the most affected country in South America with 10,808 reported cases, and Bolivia had the lowest with 264 cases. In Europe, Spain was found to be the most affected with\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between HI and mpox cases across several African countries, while also examining the roles of RH, PRE, and WS. Our analysis utilized a mixed-effects count modeling approach, incorporating both count and zero-inflation components to account for excess zeros in the data. The findings suggested that several climatic factors played a significant role in mpox transmission, with increased HI being associated with higher daily case numbers, while\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this study, we examined the association between mpox cases and climate factors in the 33 most affected countries. To estimate the persistent trend and scope of the epidemic, we applied a family of generalized mixed count models, including Poisson, negative binomial, ZIP, and ZINB models. Our results indicated that the ZINB model was the most suitable for predicting daily new cases in the analyzed countries. We found a statistically significant positive association between HI and mpox cases,\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Salman Arif Cheema:** Writing – review & editing, Supervision, Methodology, Conceptualization. **Mukhtiar Hussain Bhayo:** Writing – review & editing, Supervision, Conceptualization. **Abdu R Rahman:** Writing – original draft, Visualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Conceptualization. **Tahir Munir:** Writing – original draft, Visualization, Software, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation. **Maheen Fazal:** Writing – review & editing, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.\n\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- B.M.

Both types spread the same way and can be prevented using the same methods.\n- There have been more than 40,000 cases of clade I monkeypox in several countries in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- There have also been several travel-associated clade I monkeypox cases reported in countries in other parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.\n- There's an outbreak of clade II monkeypox in West Africa. Several cases in the United States have been tied to travel from the area.\n- Clade II monkeypox cases continue to spread at low levels in many countries around the world.\n- CDC works with public health partners across the world to monitor for monkeypox cases and increase surveillance capacity, in addition to other activities.\n\n\n![A colorized transmission electron microscopic image of monkeypox virus particles, found within an infected cell](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/09/26500_lores.jpg)\n\n## Current situation\n\n### In the United States\n\n- Health authorities in Southern California have reported three cases of clade I monkeypox in people with no recent travel. All three individuals are recovering from the illness. Viral genomic (DNA fingerprint) data indicate that these three cases may be linked to a different US case reported in August 2025. For more information see [Community Spread of Clade I Mpox Within California](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/CAHAN/Community-Spread-of-Clade-I-Mpox-Within-California.aspx).\n- There have been six reported cases of clade I monkeypox in the United States in people who had recently traveled to affected areas associated with the outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa.\n- CDC regularly [assesses the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to the overall population and specific populations within the United States posed by the [clade I monkeypox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/); it remains low.\n- Clade II monkeypox is [still circulating at low levels](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/data-research/cases/index.html).\n  - CDC is tracking a recent uptick of U.S. cases of clade II across several different states linked to an [outbreak of clade II monkeypox in Sierra Leone, Liberia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), and other West African countries. CDC is collaborating with U.S. laboratories and Sierra Leone contacts to better understand the situation.\n- Children have historically gotten monkeypox in endemic areas in Western and Central Africa, and in this outbreak the high number of children with monkeypox reported in likely reflects spread within households.\n  - Based on what we know right now, we [don't expect to see the same sort of risk in children](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/php/data-research/clade-i-monkeypox-in-children-in-africa-and-potential-impacts-on-children-in-the-united-states.html) if monkeypox were introduced in the United States for reasons including different household makeup and size, access to disinfecting products, and improved access to medical care.\n\n[Clade I Monkeypox Outbreak Originating in Central Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html)\n\nOutbreaks of clade I monkeypox are occurring in Central and Eastern Africa\n\n[Clade II Monkeypox Outbreaks around the World](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html)\n\nInformation on the ongoing outbreak of clade II monkeypox\n\n### Across the globe\n\n- There are [outbreaks of clade I monkeypox in Central and Eastern Africa](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html).\n  - Clade I has two subclades, clade Ia and clade Ib.\n  - In Central Africa, people have gotten clade Ia monkeypox through contact with infected dead or live wild animals, household transmission, or patient care; a high proportion of clade Ia cases have been reported in children younger than 15 years of age.\n  - More recently, subclade Ib has been identified in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo and has spread through intimate and adult sexual contact, including heterosexual spread with sex trade workers. Further spread outside of eastern DRC has occurred.\n  - Based on what we know now, clade Ib monkeypox has a lower case-fatality rate than clade Ia monkeypox.\n- Sustained and local person-to-person spread of clade I monkeypox has taken place in some non-endemic countries through sexual contact, day-to-day household contact, and within the healthcare setting in the absence of personal protective equipment.\n- As of September 15, 2025, the countries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia are experiencing **sustained** human-to-human transmission of the virus; there is also evidence of sustained transmission in Central African Republic and Republic of the Congo.\n- As of September 15, 2025, countries reporting travel-associated cases of clade I monkeypox since January 1, 2024, include Angola, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zimbabwe.\n- The [ongoing global outbreak of clade IIb](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2022/index-1.html) monkeypox has caused more than 100,000 cases in 122 total countries, including 115 countries where monkeypox was not previously reported.\n- Sierra Leone, Liberia, and other countries in West Africa are experiencing an outbreak of **clade II monkeypox**.\n  - Travelers to Sierra Leone and Liberia should review the [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-sierra-leone-liberia), which includes information about the [monkeypox vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html) for eligible people.\n\n### Global case data\n\nFor global case data since January 1, 2024, see [2022-24 Monkeypox (Monkeypox) Outbreak: Global Trends (shinyapps.io)](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/#8_Disclaimers). Confirmed cases include those that are laboratory confirmed as monkeypox virus and may include cases only confirmed as _orthopoxvirus_. These data are provided for situational awareness and are subject to change.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n### In Africa\n\n- CDC continues critical work to protect the United States from emerging and infectious diseases. CDC has collaborated closely with key partners in affected countries to help support efforts to stop monkeypox at the source.\n- CDC and in-country partners across Africa have worked together on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity-building, strengthening local workforce capacity, case investigation, strengthening case management, infection prevention and control, and vaccine strategy and planning.\n- CDC collaborated with governmental and civil society partners in affected countries to collect and analyze case data, and to identify how monkeypox is spreading.\n- CDC trained 80 field epidemiologists in DRC and continues to provide key support for many who are still working in priority health zones. These CDC-trained epidemiologists are playing a key role in DRC efforts to detect cases, trace and monitor contacts, and increase community awareness of monkeypox, while also collecting and sending specimens to labs for testing, and training healthcare workers to do the same.\n\n- CDC is coordinating technical assistance in response to urgent needs identified by national governments and local partners in the areas of laboratory, surveillance, risk communication and community engagement, case management, infection prevention and control, psychosocial support, and vaccine planning.\n- The U.S. government is also working closely with several other countries in the region to assist with monitoring the situation as new information becomes available.\n\n- CDC's staff stationed in several countries affected by or on the border with countries with monkeypox cases provide critical information to inform U.S. preparedness efforts. Staff are connected to CDC's response efforts and can provide critical, real-time information to inform CDC's understanding of the outbreak, mitigate importation of cases into the U.S., and inform U.S. preparedness efforts.\n- Response efforts include increasing the number of monkeypox testing sites; improving specimen transport networks to quickly identify new cases; assisting with Ministry of Health-led vaccine implementation; strengthening emergency management systems; improving case surveillance; and training healthcare workers on infection prevention and control.\n\n\n### In the United States\n\n- CDC works closely with state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments to provide recommendations for clinical management, diagnosis, and prevention of monkeypox cases in the U.S.\n- CDC continually increases capacity in communities across the United States for early detection of monkeypox through existing surveillance systems, including [wastewater testing](https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance/mpox-data.html).\n\n- CDC raises awareness for healthcare providers, including the latest guidance for [considering monkeypox](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00513.asp) as a possible diagnosis in certain patients.\n- CDC has information and recommendations for members of the public, including those traveling to Central or Eastern Africa: [Travel Health Notice](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/monkeypox-drc-neighboring-countries) and [Health Alert Network](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp) advisory.\n- CDC works with researchers and partner organizations to increase health equity around monkeypox and ensure that the populations most affected by monkeypox have access to the monkeypox vaccine.\n- CDC [conducts assessments](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/mpox-risk-assessment-november-update.html) to determine the risks of monkeypox to the people in the United States.\n\n## Resources\n\n- Get monkeypox and other vaccine recommendations when traveling to Central and Eastern Africa: [Destinations \\| Travelers' Health \\| CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)\n- [Clade II Monkeypox in Liberia and Sierra Leone -
