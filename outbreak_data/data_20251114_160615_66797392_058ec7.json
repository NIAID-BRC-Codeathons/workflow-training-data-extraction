When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

Key drivers of vaccine hesitancy (misinformation about vaccine safety, philosophical and religious exemptions, and pandemic-related disruptions) are discussed, along with the demographic patterns of under-vaccination in the U.S. Comparisons are drawn to notable measles outbreaks in Samoa (2019) and the United Kingdom (2018) to highlight common themes of insufficient immunity leading to severe outcomes. The review evaluates what aspects of the public health response were effective, including emergency vaccination campaigns, community engagement, and interagency coordination, and what challenges and failures impeded control, such as resource limitations and delayed counter-misinformation efforts. The economic impact of the outbreak is also considered, with containment efforts costing millions of dollars. We summarize the lessons learned about the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and suggest policy implications, which include stricter immunization requirements, proactive education to combat misinformation, and strengthening immunization infrastructure. Finally, future directions and recommendations are presented to prevent measles from regaining a foothold, emphasizing that sustained commitment to vaccination and public trust is critical to averting similar crises.\n\n**Keywords:** measles, public health coverage, united states of america, vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy\n\n## Introduction and background\n\nMeasles, once a ubiquitous childhood infection in the U.S., was declared eliminated nationally in 2000 after decades of widespread vaccination and vigilant surveillance \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF1)\\]. Yet elimination never guaranteed permanence. During the 2010s, an erosion of public confidence in vaccines, amplified by online misinformation, chipped away at the herd immunity that had suppressed endemic transmission \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF2)\\]. Concerningly, kindergarten coverage with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine fell from 95.2% in the 2019-2020 school year to 92.7% in 2023-2024, leaving an estimated 280,000 children susceptible \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3)\\].\n\nThe consequences of those immunity gaps became starkly apparent in early 2025. On 30 May 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 1,088 confirmed measles cases across 33 jurisdictions, including the first measles-related deaths recorded in the country since 2015 \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF4)\\]. More than 90% of patients were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, and nearly all cases were epidemiologically linked to undervaccinated communities in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Air travel and domestic tourism quickly distributed the virus to additional states, illustrating how a single imported case can ignite nationwide spread when local protection is uneven.\n\nAlthough the absolute numbers remain modest compared with the pre-vaccine era, the 2025 outbreak represents the largest U.S. measles crisis in a decade and a critical stress test of the nation’s vaccine policy architecture. It also mirrors recent international setbacks, notably the 2018 United Kingdom resurgence and the 2019 Samoa epidemic, underscoring that measles control is precarious wherever vaccination falters.\n\nIn this narrative review, we synthesize current evidence to elucidate (1) the historical and epidemiologic context of the 2025 U.S. outbreak, (2) the socio-behavioral and policy drivers of vaccine hesitancy that primed the crisis, (3) the strengths and weaknesses of the public health response, (4) the human and economic costs incurred, and (5) the lessons and forward-looking strategies required to restore and sustain measles elimination. By integrating national data with insights from global comparators, we aim to furnish clinicians, policymakers, and public health practitioners with a comprehensive blueprint for preventing measles from regaining a foothold in the U.S.\n\n## Review\n\nMethods\n\nFor this narrative review, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and official health organization websites (CDC, WHO) to identify sources on measles outbreaks, vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy, and public health responses published between 2010 and 2025. Sources were eligible if they (i) contained primary or secondary data on measles epidemiology, vaccination coverage, or hesitancy; (ii) were published in English during 2010-2025; and (iii) offered a verifiable DOI or permanent URL. Editorials without data, conference abstracts, and duplicate preprints were excluded. Search terms included combinations of “measles,” “outbreak,” “vaccine hesitancy,” “measles 2025,” “vaccination coverage,” “measles mortality,” and “measles elimination.” We prioritized peer-reviewed articles (epidemiological studies, reviews, commentaries) and authoritative reports (e.g., Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) briefs, WHO updates), with particular focus on data from the 2025 U.S. outbreak and comparator events such as the 2019 Samoa epidemic and the 2018 measles resurgence in Europe. Outbreak case counts and vaccination-coverage figures were cross-checked against the CDC and WHO databases for accuracy. All U.S. 2025 figures reflect data current as of 30 May 2025.\n\nHistorical perspective and outbreak epidemiology\n\nMeasles elimination in the U.S. was achieved in 2000 through decades of high vaccine coverage and aggressive public health campaigns \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF5)\\]. In the years immediately after, only a handful of cases occurred annually, typically in travelers or their close contacts. However, by the 2010s, declining vaccination in certain communities led to a series of outbreaks. For example, in 2017, a measles outbreak in Minnesota’s Somali-American community, where unfounded fears about MMR causing autism had spread, resulted in 75 cases \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF6)\\]. These incidents were a prelude to a larger resurgence in 2019, when the U.S. recorded 1,282 cases, the most since 1992 \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF7)\\]. That year, the vast majority of cases were confined to under-immunized enclaves, including a prolonged outbreak of 934 cases in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in New York that nearly cost the country its elimination status. Although no measles deaths occurred in 2019, the outbreaks were a wake-up call that highlighted growing vaccine complacency.\n\nThis American pattern mirrored global trends. Europe saw measles cases surge in 2018-2019, and the United Kingdom lost its measles-free status after a protracted outbreak (991 cases in 2018) reestablished endemic transmission \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF8)\\]. In late 2019, Samoa experienced a devastating measles epidemic, with over 5,700 cases and 83 deaths, after national MMR coverage fell to around 30% \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF9)\\]. These examples demonstrate that if vaccination rates decline, measles can resurface and cause significant harm.\n\nOutbreak epidemiology\n\nThe 2025 U.S. measles outbreak began in early January, seeded by an infected traveler in a close-knit, undervaccinated community in West Texas. From there, the virus spread across at least three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma) among populations with historically low MMR uptake. By 17 April 2025, the CDC had reported 800 cases nationally, already the second-highest annual total in 25 years, and it was noted that 82% were linked to the outbreak in those three states \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF10)\\]. Despite control efforts, the case count continued to rise; as of 29 May 2025, a total of 1,088 measles cases had been confirmed across 33 states \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. Fourteen distinct outbreaks (defined as three or more linked cases) were identified in 2025, though the majority of all cases were associated with the large Texas-centered outbreak. Figure [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#FIG1) depicts the weekly accumulation of cases from 6 January through 30 May 2025, illustrating the rapid March-to-April growth phase and subsequent deceleration.\n\n### Figure 1.

More than 90% of patients were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status (per CDC reports), and many belonged to communities that had resisted routine immunizations. Cases spanned all age groups, but young children were heavily affected: roughly one-third of cases were in children under five (including many infants too young to be vaccinated), another third in school-aged children, and the remainder in adults. About 1 in 10 patients required hospitalization for measles complications or isolation. Most tragically, three measles-related deaths occurred (two children and one immunocompromised adult), the first U.S. measles fatalities in over 20 years \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF12)\\]. Genomic analyses confirmed that the outbreaks stemmed from imported virus strains, not a new endemic variant \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF13)\\]. Notably, travel played a role in amplifying the spread: for instance, several cases in Colorado and Illinois were traced to exposures during domestic airline flights and at tourist destinations \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF14)\\]. These scenarios illustrated how quickly measles can hop between susceptible pockets. As illustrated in Figure [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#FIG2), sustained measles activity in 2025 global hotspots, particularly parts of Europe, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, generated multiple air-travel corridors into major U.S. airports, ultimately funneling cases into the undervaccinated Texas-New Mexico-Oklahoma cluster that seeded the domestic outbreak. Conversely, areas with high vaccination coverage largely escaped secondary transmission, demonstrating the protective value of herd immunity where it remained intact.\n\n### Figure 2. International Measles Transmission Pattern.\n\n[![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b052/12357784/b7a1c69aa296/cureus-0017-00000088196-i02.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12357784_cureus-0017-00000088196-i02.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/figure/FIG2/)\n\nConceptual illustration of measles spread through international air travel. In 2025, imported measles cases (infected travelers arriving in the U.S.) ignited outbreaks in undervaccinated communities. Global travel has linked measles outbreaks across continents, underscoring that high vaccination coverage is needed everywhere to prevent cross-border spread.\n\nImage credit: Ubalaeze Solomon Elechi, created with OpenAI’s GPT-4 and DALL-E tools\n\nComparative Analysis: Affected Versus Unaffected States\n\nAs of 30 May 2025, the three core outbreak states (Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma) recorded a mean incidence of 7.4 cases per million residents, whereas the remaining 47 jurisdictions averaged 0.06 cases per million, a 120-fold difference \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. States in the lowest kindergarten MMR-coverage quartile (≤ 92%) accounted for 87% of all U.S. cases, while no state with ≥ 96% coverage reported more than five cases \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3)\\]. This inverse relationship between coverage and incidence mirrors modeling work showing that every percentage-point drop in two-dose coverage increases outbreak probability by roughly 14% \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF15)\\].\n\nGranular Demographic Breakdown\n\nThe U.S. 2025 cases had a demographic profile of 1,088 individuals. Among line-listed patients, 34% were children under five years of age, 33% were school-aged (5-17 years), and 28% were adults ≥ 18 years; the remaining 5% had age unreported \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. Hospitalization was required for 11% of cases overall, rising to 18% in infants < 12 months. Vaccination status was known for 1,012 patients: 86% were unvaccinated, 7% had received only one MMR dose, and 7% were fully vaccinated, yielding an estimated two-dose effectiveness of 97% against confirmed disease. Sex distribution was balanced (51% male). Racial/ethnic data, available for 62% of cases, showed over-representation of Hispanic/Latino children in the Texas and New Mexico clusters, while non-Hispanic White children predominated in the Oklahoma and Colorado clusters \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\].\n\nVaccine hesitancy: drivers and demographics\n\nMeasles outbreaks in the 21st century have been overwhelmingly linked to clusters of unvaccinated individuals, raising the question: Why are people forgoing a readily available, life-saving vaccine? The drivers of vaccine hesitancy are multifaceted. Foremost is misinformation about vaccine safety, notably the debunked claim linking the MMR vaccine to autism, originally propagated by a fraudulent study in 1998 \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF16)\\]. Fear of autism remains a leading reason cited by parents who refuse MMR for their children. Other parental concerns include perceived risks of vaccine side effects, the belief that “natural” immunity is healthier, and general distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government health agencies. Social media and online echo chambers have amplified vaccine misinformation, allowing anti-vaccine activists to sow doubt about the MMR vaccine’s safety despite an overwhelming scientific consensus of its safety and efficacy. The result has been a measurable decline in public confidence in childhood vaccines in some communities. The WHO identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019 \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF2)\\], acknowledging that complacency and misinformation were undermining decades of progress. In the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic may have further fueled hesitancy; not only did routine pediatric vaccination rates dip during pandemic lockdowns, but polarized debates around COVID-19 vaccines spilled over to routine immunizations, reinforcing doubts among some groups \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF17)\\].\n\nLegacy of the MMR-Autism Myth\n\nPersistent concern that the MMR vaccine causes autism remains the single most frequently cited reason for MMR refusal in U.S. parent surveys \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF18)\\]. Evidence refuting this link is unequivocal: a 2014 population-based meta-analysis of over 1.2 million children found no association between MMR exposure and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF19)\\]. A nationwide Danish cohort study covering 657,461 births likewise reported a null association (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85-1.02) \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF20)\\]. Most recently, an updated U.K. matched-cohort analysis reaffirmed that ASD incidence is identical in vaccinated and unvaccinated children \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF21)\\]. Despite this consensus, online recirculation of the discredited 1998 Wakefield paper continues to seed hesitancy within some communities, indicating the importance of proactive, evidence-based communication strategies.\n\nDemographics\n\nHesitancy is not uniform across the population; it clusters in specific demographics and communities. Paradoxically, areas with higher socioeconomic status and education levels have at times harbored more vaccine-refusing parents. For example, communities in California and Colorado, where “natural lifestyle” movements flourish, saw MMR vaccination rates fall well below 90% before policy changes. In the 2023-2024 school year, the national average MMR coverage for kindergarteners was 92.7%, but this average masks geographic pockets of much lower coverage \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3)\\]. Fourteen U.S. states reported that over 5% of their kindergarten students had non-medical vaccine exemptions in 2023-2024, with the national exemption rate rising to 3.3% \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF22)\\]. These exemptions, often due to personal or religious belief waivers, tend to concentrate in certain schools and communities, creating pockets of susceptibility. Religious or cultural beliefs also play a role: insular religious communities (such as the Amish, some Orthodox Jewish groups, and certain fundamentalist churches) have experienced measles outbreaks after members declined vaccines for faith-related reasons \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF23)\\]. Minority communities can face unique challenges; for instance, Somali-American families in Minnesota were targeted by anti-vaccine misinformation about autism, leading to a dramatic drop in MMR uptake and a subsequent measles outbreak in 2017 within that community \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF23)\\]. Additionally, structural barriers and healthcare access inequalities mean some children miss vaccinations not by choice but due to healthcare system gaps, although the Vaccines for Children program and public health clinics aim to minimize this in the U.S.\n\nThe demographics of the 2025 measles outbreak reflect these hesitancy patterns. Several West Texas counties at the center of the 2025 outbreak have carried kindergarten two-dose MMR coverage well below the 90% threshold for multiple consecutive years: Briscoe County, TX, 80.0%; Childress County, TX, 70.5%; and Dawson County, TX, 88.1%, compared with the 2023-2024 national average of 92.7% \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF24), [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF25)\\]. CDC line-list data show that through 17 April 2025, 69% of U.S. measles cases occurred in persons < 20 years of age (38% aged 5-19 years and 31% aged < 5 years), and over 90% of all patients were either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF10), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\], patterns consistent with pockets of routine-immunization refusal in the affected communities. Meanwhile, several adult measles cases in the 2025 outbreak were individuals who had never been vaccinated due to similar beliefs or who missed childhood vaccination and lacked awareness of the need. Ultimately, the outbreak was driven by immunity gaps rather than any change in the virus or the vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy, fueled by fear, misinformation, and sociocultural dynamics, supplied the tinder, and a single imported case ignited an epidemic in these unprotected communities.\n\nPublic health response and economic impact: what worked, what failed\n\nContaining the 2025 outbreaks required a swift and coordinated public health response. Local, state, and federal agencies implemented classic measures: prompt isolation of cases, contact tracing, and targeted vaccination of susceptible contacts and communities \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF26)\\]. Health departments in Texas and neighboring states held emergency immunization clinics and, in affected counties, even recommended an early MMR dose for infants 6-11 months old \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF27)\\]. Schools in outbreak areas excluded unvaccinated students during the incubation period, and public health officials issued travel advisories and alerts to clinicians. These efforts, alongside extensive community outreach, eventually curbed the spread by early summer 2025 \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. As summarized in Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#TAB1), the 2025 U.S. outbreak’s scale was comparable to recent high-profile resurgences in Samoa (2019) and the United Kingdom (2018), underscoring how gaps in coverage translate into costly public-health responses.\n\n### Table 1. Key Measles Outbreaks in Recent Years (Selected Examples).\n\nNote: Immunization coverage refers to the estimated national or subnational uptake of the first and/or second dose of MMR vaccine prior to each outbreak. Data were compiled from the CDC and WHO reports. \"Pockets of low coverage\" denote geographic or demographic subgroups with significantly lower-than-average vaccine uptake, which contributed to outbreak vulnerability.\n\nMMR: measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; WHO: World Health Organization; U.S.: United States\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Location (Year) | Cases | Deaths | Immunization Coverage (Pre-outbreak) | Notable Characteristics |\n| United States (2019) | 1,282 | 0 | ~94% nationwide; pockets of low coverage (some communities < 80%) | Largest U.S. measles outbreak since 1992; concentrated in under-vaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities (~75% of cases); elimination status narrowly preserved \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF7)\\]. |\n| United States (2025) | 1,088 | 3 | 92.7% nationwide; local pockets < 70% | Worst U.S. outbreak since 2019 (ongoing); ~90% of cases in unvaccinated persons; includes a major outbreak in West Texas/New Mexico (82% of 2025 cases) \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF11)\\]. |\n| United Kingdom (2018) | 991 | 3 | ~95% (first dose), ~87% (second dose) at school entry | Lost WHO “measles-free” status after a prolonged outbreak reestablished endemic transmission; measles cases doubled from 2017 to 2018, with several fatalities in unvaccinated children \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF8)\\]. |\n| Samoa (2019) | 5,707 | 83 | ~30% (estimated MMR coverage before outbreak) | Nationwide epidemic following a dramatic drop in vaccination; > 80% of deaths in children < 5 years; state of emergency declared with mass vaccination campaign to raise coverage \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF9)\\]. |\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/table/TAB1/)\n\nCertain response strategies clearly worked. Rapid case identification through vigilant surveillance and laboratory testing allowed timely interventions. Interagency communication (fortified by pandemic-era coordination frameworks) facilitated resource sharing, and community leaders were engaged to promote vaccination in hesitant populations \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF26)\\]. The fact that measles did not become endemic beyond the initial clusters is a testament to these control measures. However, the outbreak also exposed gaps. Years of inadequate investment in vaccine education meant that by the time officials mobilized messaging in 2025, misinformation was deeply entrenched in the hardest-hit communities \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF28)\\]. Understaffed local health departments struggled with the surge in contact tracing and immunization workloads, reflecting a broader disinvestment in public health infrastructure. Jurisdictional complexities (for example, coordinating quarantine across state lines) at times hampered the speed of response. On 7 March 2025, the CDC issued Health Alert Network Advisory #00522 instructing jurisdictions to isolate suspected cases, trace contacts, and administer post-exposure MMR within 72 hours or immune globulin within six days \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF26), [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF29)\\]. Within a week, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) circulated the same protocol to county health departments \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF30)\\]. Yet rural West Texas counties reported that vaccine stockpiles were depleted and that only one or two immunization nurses were available for surge duty, producing contact-tracing backlogs of 48-60 hours \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF31), [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF32)\\]. The 2022 NACCHO Profile Survey had already found that 51% of U.S. local health departments lacked sufficient staff to manage vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surges \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF33)\\], a gap echoed in Texas after-action reviews. Meanwhile, the CDC’s advisory recommended furlough of exposed but non-immune healthcare workers; several rural hospitals complied yet could not backfill shifts, forcing diversion of febrile-rash patients to distant facilities \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF34)\\]. These examples illustrate how robust federal guidance can be blunted when county-level workforce and vaccine reserves are inadequate \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF28)\\].\n\nThe economic impact of the outbreak was substantial. Measles containment is labor-intensive and costly: each case requires investigation and follow-up of many contacts, and quarantines and public information campaigns carry significant costs. A recent analysis of a 2019 measles outbreak in Washington State estimated an average cost of about $47,000 per measles case (including public health response and productivity losses) \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF35)\\]. Using that figure, more than 1,000 cases in 2025 imposed tens of millions of dollars in societal costs. Most of this expense fell on public health agencies that diverted personnel and resources to the outbreak, as well as on hospitals that treated severe cases. These costs far exceed the investments that would have been needed to maintain high vaccination coverage in the first place, a stark economic argument for prevention \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF36)\\].\n\nVulnerable populations and health disparities\n\nCertain groups suffered disproportionately during the measles resurgence. Infants too young to be vaccinated (under 12 months) were at extreme risk; many of the 2025 cases occurred in babies less than a year old, including one of the fatal cases \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF10)\\]. Children under five years of age in general are highly vulnerable to measles complications like pneumonia and encephalitis; historically, this age group accounts for the majority of measles deaths worldwide \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF37)\\]. In Samoa’s 2019 outbreak, 87% of measles fatalities were in children under five. The 2025 U.S. outbreak reaffirmed this pattern, as young children made up a large share of hospitalizations and the two pediatric deaths.\n\nBeyond age, immunocompromised individuals are another vulnerable population. People who cannot receive live vaccines due to conditions such as leukemia or immunosuppressive therapy rely on herd immunity for protection \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF38)\\]. The death of an adult cancer patient in the 2025 outbreak (who contracted measles from his community) underscores that even a single measles case in the wrong setting can be devastating. Pregnant women are also at elevated risk of severe measles and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although fortunately, no pregnant patients died in 2025 \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF39)\\].\n\nMeasles outbreaks tend to exploit social and economic disparities. Underserved communities with limited healthcare access may have lower vaccination rates not out of intent, but because of practical barriers. Parent interviews in the CDC’s National Immunization Survey identified lack of transportation, inconvenient clinic hours, and childcare costs as common obstacles to keeping vaccine appointments \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF40)\\]. At the same time, several of the worst recent outbreaks (in the U.S. and abroad) have occurred in relatively insular communities (defined by religious or cultural ties) that resist vaccination, regardless of socioeconomic status. Vulnerability to measles is shaped not only by socioeconomic access but also by beliefs and information: California data show personal-belief exemptions cluster in affluent, highly educated communities \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF6), [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF41)\\], while the 2017 Somali-American outbreak in Minnesota stemmed from autism-related vaccine fears despite free clinic availability. In 2025, some rural counties with healthcare provider shortages experienced delayed diagnoses, which allowed wider spread \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF42)\\]. Language and cultural barriers further hampered warning efforts in certain immigrant communities. Addressing these issues requires culturally competent engagement well before outbreaks occur. Ultimately, the presence of measles anywhere reveals which populations have been left behind, whether due to marginalization or misinformation, and those gaps must be closed to protect everyone.\n\nThe persistence of “zero-dose” children, those who have not received even a first dose of any routine vaccine, has become a key global indicator of immunization system fragility \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF43)\\]. The undervaccinated pockets that fueled the 2025 U.S. outbreak function much like zero-dose clusters in low- and middle-income countries, suggesting that domestic dashboards could adopt the same metric to flag communities where measles is most likely to resurge.\n\nLessons learned and policy implications\n\nThe 2025 experience has crystallized several lessons for policymakers and public health practitioners. Foremost, maintaining high vaccination coverage is essential. The reemergence of measles in the U.S. vividly demonstrated that even small declines in community immunity can have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, proactive measures to counter vaccine hesitancy should be a permanent fixture of public health work. Such action includes continuous public education that adapts to evolving misinformation, as well as readily accessible vaccination services.\n\nOne policy implication is the reconsideration of vaccine exemption policies. States with lenient non-medical exemption (NME) rules observed a higher concentration of unvaccinated children \\[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF44)\\], and this outbreak disproportionately affected those clusters. Stricter requirements (for example, only permitting medical exemptions, as California and some other states have done) could be expanded to more jurisdictions. At minimum, simplifying the process for families to vaccinate could help raise immunization rates \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF45)\\]. Schools and daycare centers are critical enforcement points; ensuring they have the mandate and resources to verify student vaccinations and exclude unvaccinated individuals during outbreaks is key.\n\nAnother lesson is the importance of engaging communities and building trust long before health emergencies arise. Combatting misinformation isn’t just about debunking myths in the media; it requires on-the-ground relationships. Local health departments might establish dedicated outreach teams to work with communities known to have lower vaccination rates, partnering with local leaders, clergy, and healthcare providers to deliver consistent pro-vaccine messages \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF46)\\]. Listening and dialogue are as important as messaging in this effort; people’s concerns must be heard and addressed respectfully to rebuild trust. The outbreak showed that trying to change minds in the midst of a crisis is extremely difficult; the groundwork must be laid in advance.\n\nThe outbreak also strengthens the argument for investing in public health infrastructure. The relative containment of measles (it did not become endemic nationwide) was due in part to the rapid mobilization of public health teams. Yet the strain on those teams was apparent: at the height of the response, Texas could field only 2,800 contact tracers, after 400 had been reassigned, against the governor’s target of 4,000 and well below independent estimates of 9,000 to 20,000 needed for statewide control \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF47)\\]. Policymakers should see these findings as evidence that funding stable epidemiology and immunization programs (not just emergency surge funding) is an investment that pays off. Modernizing immunization information systems to better identify pockets of under-vaccination can enable targeted interventions in the future. For example, predictive modeling studies suggest that without improvements, the U.S. could see measles regaining a foothold within a few decades. One recent model estimated that a sustained 10% decline in MMR coverage could lead to over 11 million measles cases in the U.S. over 25 years \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF48)\\]. Such scenarios underscore the urgency of taking preventive actions now.\n\nFinally, there is a global dimension to these lessons. Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere. The U.S. will remain at risk of importation as long as measles circulates globally, so supporting international vaccination efforts (through the WHO, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and other initiatives) aligns with national self-interest \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF37)\\]. The Samoa and UK experiences show that even relatively small populations can generate large outbreaks that reverberate internationally. Thus, recommitting to the global measles elimination agenda is part of the solution; this includes sharing best practices, data, and resources to bolster measles control in every region.\n\nThe 2025 crisis taught us that complacency is dangerous. However, it has also presented an opportunity and acted as a catalyst to fortify policies and programs, ensuring that a disease such as measles doesn't surprise us in the future.\n\nFuture directions and recommendations\n\nThe priority should and must be to translate these lessons into concrete action \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF49)\\]. This review’s findings support several recommendations. First, immunization policy should be updated to ensure more uniform coverage, for instance, by narrowing exemption allowances and considering requirements for documentation of immunity in settings like colleges or healthcare employment \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF38), [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF45)\\]. Second, we recommend enhanced investment in vaccine education and outreach, taking advantage of social media and community networks to spread accurate information and counter myths \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF50)\\]. Programs that train local trusted figures (teachers, religious leaders, etc.) to advocate for vaccination could be expanded \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF49)\\]. Third, innovative solutions to improve vaccine uptake should be pursued: for example, research into needle-free vaccine delivery (such as microneedle patches for measles) could reduce barriers and fear, and integrating vaccination reminders into electronic health records and pharmacy systems could increase convenience \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF51)\\].\n\nIt is also advisable to incorporate checks of measles vaccination status into routine healthcare and public health activities. For instance, pediatricians should consistently review and catch up on immunizations at every visit, and public health programs might organize periodic “vaccination days” in communities with low coverage, offering free MMR shots with minimal red tape.\n\nOn a national preparedness level, establishing rapid response teams specifically for VPD outbreaks could improve reaction time. These teams could be pre-trained and deployed when clusters of measles (or similar diseases) are detected, much like disaster response units.\n\nImplementation should be audited with clear metrics. Nationally, the CDC already tracks two-dose MMR coverage through SchoolVaxView; the Healthy People 2030 benchmark is ≥ 95% in every state \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF3), [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF52)\\]. Jurisdictions could add the “7-1-7” timeliness target, detect a cluster within seven days, begin investigation within one day, and complete initial control within seven days as a rapid-response scorecard for VPD outbreaks \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF53)\\]. Health departments could use county-level dashboards that publish real-time kindergarten MMR and exemption percentages from immunization-information-system (IIS) feeds to trigger outreach whenever coverage drops below the 92% herd-immunity threshold.\n\nPolicy experience shows that narrowing NMEs quickly boosts coverage. After California abolished personal-belief exemptions, kindergarten MMR coverage increased from 92.8% to 95.1% in two years \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF45)\\], while Maine’s 2019 repeal of NMEs produced a 4-point gain, with coverage reaching 97% by 2024-2025 \\[ [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF54)\\].\n\nInternationally, the U.S. can lead by example by re-achieving measles elimination and maintaining it \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF49)\\]. This means stopping current outbreaks and building a resilient system that quickly addresses any future importation. It also means continuing to support global measles control, such as contributing to global vaccine stockpiles and outbreak response funds and assisting other countries in strengthening their immunization programs.\n\nIn the end, the direction is clear: prevent, prevent, prevent. The tools to avoid measles outbreaks exist, and the 2025 crisis has reinforced that we must use them proactively. By doing so, we protect not only our communities but also contribute to the global fight against a virus that no longer needs to cause suffering in the 21st century \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357784/#REF55)\\].\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe 2025 U.S. measles outbreak is a sobering reminder that public health victories are never permanent. When population immunity slips, even slightly, vaccine-preventable diseases regain a foothold. Yet the episode also proved that rapid, well-coordinated public health action can still break chains of transmission before measles becomes endemic again. The task ahead is to convert the lessons learned into stronger policies, sustained outreach, and renewed trust in vaccination so we do not repeat this cycle.\n\nParents’ concerns do not end with disproven autism myths; many remain uneasy about the common, generally mild side effects that follow routine immunization. Addressing those concerns openly and consistently, making side effect profiles part of every informed-consent conversation, has been shown to build confidence rather than erode it. In the future, new methods for administering vaccines, such as microneedle patches or inhaled powders that don't require refrigeration, could make it easier to get vaccinated without needles and help reach people in remote areas. If these methods prove effective, they could help reduce fear and increase vaccination rates. Measles is fully preventable, and the tools to prevent it already exist. It is our collective responsibility to ensure the effective and equitable use of these tools. By doing so, we can turn the setback of 2025 into renewed momentum toward durable measles elimination, protecting today’s children and generations yet to come.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe article's figure preparation was assisted by OpenAI’s GPT-4 and DALL-E tools under the direct supervision of the authors.\n\n## Disclosures\n\n**Conflicts of interest:** In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\n**Payment/services info:** All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n**Financial relationships:** All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\n**Other relationships:** All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\n**Concept and design:**  Adekunle F.

    "content": "[Skip to content](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/return-measles-global-health-crisis-unfolding-2025#main-content)\n\nUpdates regarding our human remains policy.\n\n[click here](https://muttermuseum.org/mutter-matters)\n\n[Blog](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog)\n\n# The Return of Measles: A Global Health Crisis Unfolding in 2025\n\nBy\n\nRené F. Najera, DrPH\n\nSeptember 30, 2025\n\nMeasles, once nearly eliminated in many parts of the world, has made a dangerous comeback in 2025. This highly contagious disease has spread rapidly across continents, affecting both developing nations struggling with poverty and conflict, and wealthy countries where vaccination rates have declined. Understanding what’s happening worldwide helps us see how interconnected our global health really is.\n\n###### A Global Picture of Concern\n\nWhen we examine measles today, we see a story that spans from remote villages in Afghanistan to suburban communities in Texas. The numbers tell a sobering tale: globally, an estimated [10.3 million people were infected with measles](https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html) in 2023, and 2025 has brought even more cases. What makes this particularly troubling is that measles is entirely preventable through vaccination.\n\nMeasles spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It’s so contagious that if one person has measles, up to 90% of the people around them who aren’t immune will also contract the infection. The disease begins with symptoms that may resemble a cold or flu-like illness: fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Then comes the telltale rash, spreading from the head down to the feet. But measles isn’t just an uncomfortable childhood illness. It can cause serious complications, including brain swelling, pneumonia, and death, particularly in young children and adults.\n\n###### The Devastating Toll in Developing Nations\n\nThe hardest-hit regions in 2025 have been countries already struggling with poverty, conflict, and weak healthcare systems. In [Morocco, over 40,000 cases and 184 deaths](https://outbreaknewstoday.substack.com/p/morocco-measles-cases-top-40000-in) have been reported, making it one of the world’s most severe outbreaks. The situation became so dire that Morocco launched a nationwide vaccination campaign targeting everyone under 18 years old.\n\nIn Afghanistan, where healthcare has collapsed following years of conflict, [Doctors Without Borders recorded at least one child dying from measles every single day](https://www.msf.org/msf-records-one-child-died-measles-each-day-2025-afghanistan) during the first eight weeks of 2025. Their medical teams treated nearly 5,000 suspected measles cases at just three hospitals during this short period. This represents a heartbreaking increase compared to 2024, showing how quickly measles can spread in vulnerable populations.\n\nIndonesia faced its own crisis when [17 children died](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/after-17-die-in-measles-outbreak-indonesia-launches-vaccination-campaign) during a measles outbreak in East Java province. More than 2,000 children became infected over eight months, prompting authorities to launch an emergency vaccination campaign. The outbreak highlighted how vaccination coverage of just 72% nationally, with some provinces below 50%, leaves children dangerously exposed.\n\nAfrica has seen widespread outbreaks across multiple countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo reported [over 36,000 suspected cases and 565 deaths](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.ca/democratic-republic-of-congo-in-the-shadow-of-conflict-msf-teams-are-chasing-disease-outbreaks/) across nearly all of its 26 provinces by July 2025. Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and other nations in the Eastern Mediterranean region have also experienced large outbreaks, with eight countries in this region alone reporting approximately 105,000 confirmed cases between July 2024 and June 2025.\n\nThe Western Pacific region saw a [743% increase in measles cases](https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/item/28-05-2025-resurgence-of-preventable-diseases-threatens-children-in-east-asia-and-the-pacific) between 2022 and 2024, with the crisis continuing into 2025. Vietnam recorded over 81,000 suspected cases across all its provinces, while Mongolia reported 8 deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations.\n\n###### Europe’s Unexpected Struggle\n\nPerhaps more surprising has been Europe’s battle with measles in 2025. The European region, which includes 53 countries from Western Europe to Central Asia, experienced its [worst measles year in over 25 years](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe), with 127,350 cases reported in 2024, and the crisis continued into 2025.\n\nRomania has been particularly affected, reporting [3,605 infections and three deaths](https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising) through April 2025. The country’s outbreak has been driven by anti-vaccine sentiment, conflicting health guidance, and healthcare system challenges. With vaccination rates at just 62% in 2023, far below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks, Romania illustrates how quickly measles can take hold when vaccination coverage drops.\n\nAcross Europe, the story is similar. Countries like Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal have all reported ongoing outbreaks. The United Kingdom has seen cases [picking up again in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/measles-outbreaks-continue-with-risk-of-holidays-causing-surge), with health officials warning travelers about the risk of bringing measles back from European vacation destinations.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found that [87% of measles patients were unvaccinated](https://www.vax-before-travel.com/measles-outbreaks), highlighting how the disease primarily affects those without protection. Vaccination rates across Europe have struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels, with coverage of the second MMR dose [declining from 92% to 91%](https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/15-07-2025-childhood-vaccination-rates-lag-in-europe---fueling-further-resurgence-of-measles-and-whooping-cough) between 2019 and 2024.\n\n###### The United States Faces Its Largest Outbreak in Decades\n\nThe United States, which declared measles eliminated in 2000, experienced its [largest outbreak in over 30 years](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/09/the-2025-measles-outbreak-is-largest-in-three-decades-00444186) in 2025. As of late September, [1,514 confirmed measles cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) have been reported across 42 states, with 40 outbreaks recorded throughout the year.\n\nThe majority of U.S. cases stem from a massive outbreak that began in January 2025 in close-knit communities across New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. By April, this single outbreak had caused [654 of the 800 total U.S. cases](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm) reported at that time. The outbreak affected communities with low vaccination rates and frequent travel between similar communities across multiple states.\n\nThe human cost has been severe. [Twelve percent of patients required hospitalization](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html), with nearly a third of those hospitalized being children and teenagers. Three people have died from measles in the United States in 2025, including two unvaccinated school-aged children in Texas and one unvaccinated adult in New Mexico.\n\nWhat’s particularly concerning is that [92% of U.S. measles patients were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/cdc-confirms-23-more-us-measles-cases-2025-total-tops-1500). This pattern mirrors what we’re seeing globally: measles primarily affects those who haven’t been protected by vaccination.\n\n###### North America’s Measles Crisis: Mexico and Canada Lead the Way\n\nMexico has emerged as one of North America’s most severely affected countries in 2025, with [over 4,200 confirmed measles cases and 15 deaths](https://outbreaknewstoday.substack.com/p/mexico-reports-15th-measles-death) reported as of late August. The outbreak has been concentrated primarily in Chihuahua state, which borders Texas and accounts for [nearly 93% of Mexico's cases](https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-soaring-in-mexico/) with 3,932 infections. The crisis began when [a 9-year-old Mennonite child](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico) returned from a family trip to Texas, where measles was already circulating. Tragically, most deaths have occurred among indigenous communities, which have experienced [a case-fatality rate 20 times higher](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-surge-continues-americas-outbreaks-10-nations) than the general population. The rapid spread has been attributed to low vaccination coverage and frequent travel between under-vaccinated religious communities that span across international borders.\n\nCanada's situation is equally concerning, with [over 4,500 confirmed cases](https://www.paho.org/en/news/15-8-2025-ten-countries-americas-report-measles-outbreaks-2025) making it the country with the highest measles count in the Americas in 2025. Despite having achieved measles elimination status in 1998, Canada has reported [more cases this year than in the previous 27 years combined](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/health/measles-deaths-canada-mexico). The outbreak has been particularly devastating for vulnerable populations, with [one infant death from congenital measles](https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r1207) reported when a premature baby was born to an unvaccinated mother in Ontario. Six other babies have been born with congenital measles in Ontario alone, though they have since recovered. The outbreak began in October 2024 when an internationally imported case attended a large gathering in New Brunswick, and it has since spread to multiple provinces. Public health officials warn that if transmission continues beyond October 2025, [Canada could lose its measles elimination status](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness-response/rapid-risk-assessments-public-health-professionals/public-health-risk-assessment-measles.html), a designation it has maintained for over two decades.\n\n###### Why Measles Is Making This Comeback\n\nThe resurgence of measles in 2025 is a result of several converging factors. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine childhood vaccination programs worldwide, leaving millions of children without protection. In 2023 alone, [500,000 children across the European region](https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/us-measles-death-is-europe-protected/) missed their first dose of the measles vaccine.\n\nVaccine hesitancy, fueled by misinformation spread through social media, has taken root in communities around the world. In Morocco, [conspiracy theories that gained traction during COVID-19](https://maghrebi.org/2025/01/31/morocco-conspiracy-theories-blamed-for-measles-outbreak/) have been blamed for the current outbreak. Similar patterns of vaccine hesitancy have contributed to outbreaks in wealthy countries where high vaccination coverage was once the norm.\n\nGlobal conflict and instability have created perfect conditions for measles to spread. In countries like Afghanistan, Yemen, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, ongoing conflicts have devastated healthcare systems and displaced populations, making vaccination campaigns nearly impossible to implement effectively.\n\nInternational travel has also played a role. Most [imported U.S. cases occurred among residents returning from travel abroad](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm), bringing measles back from all six World Health Organization regions. As global measles cases rise, the risk of international spread increases.\n\n###### The Path Forward\n\nThe good news is that measles remains entirely preventable through vaccination. The MMR vaccine (protecting against measles, mumps, and rubella) is safe, effective, and has been used successfully for decades. Two doses of the vaccine provide about 97% protection against measles.\n\nCountries are responding with targeted vaccination campaigns. Indonesia launched drives to reach 78,000 children, while Morocco implemented nationwide catch-up vaccination for everyone under 18. Health officials worldwide are working to rebuild public trust in vaccines and counter misinformation with factual, science-based information.\n\nFor individuals, the message is clear: check your vaccination status and that of your family members. If you’re unsure whether you’ve received two MMR doses, contact your healthcare provider. It’s never too late to get vaccinated, and doing so not only protects you but also helps protect your community, especially those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions.\n\nThe 2025 measles crisis serves as a stark reminder that infectious diseases don’t respect borders. What happens in one part of the world can quickly affect communities thousands of miles away. By maintaining high vaccination coverage everywhere, we can prevent measles from continuing its devastating global spread and protect the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\nThe tools to end this crisis exist. What’s needed now is the collective will to use them, rebuild vaccination programs, and ensure that no child dies from a completely preventable disease. The story of measles in 2025 doesn’t have to continue being one of tragedy—it can become one of renewed commitment to global health and protection for all children.\n\n## Tags\n\n- [Africa](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/africa),\n- [Asia](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/asia),\n- [Epidemiology](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/epidemiology),\n- [Europe](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/europe),\n- [North America](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/north-america),\n- [Public Health](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/public-health-0),\n- [South America](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/south-america),\n- [Vaccines for Children](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/vaccines-children),\n- [Viral Disease](https://historyofvaccines.org/blog/tags/viral-disease),\n\n## Related\n\nTwitter Widget Iframe",
