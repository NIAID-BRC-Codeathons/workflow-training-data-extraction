When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

There are now 1,723 confirmed measles cases this year, reported by 43 jurisdictions.\n\nEighty-seven percent of measles cases are outbreak-associated, and there have been 45 US outbreaks in 2025. Among measles patients, 92% have been unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccine status. Only 4% have received both doses of measles-containing vaccine.\n\nLast year the United States had 285 measles cases. US measles activity is the highest it has been since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.\n\n### **Lost elimination status for Americas**\n\nEarlier this week, [Canada lost](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-after-record-year-outbreaks) its elimination status after it failed to contain a nationwide outbreak for 12 months that has topped 5,000 infections. This dubious milestone also meant a loss of elimination status for the entire Americas region.\n\nThe United States will be on track to follow Canada in January 2026, which will mark 12 months since a large West Texas measles outbreak began.\n\nCurrent [hot spots](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-count-climbs-arizona-utah-south-carolina-outbreaks) include the Utah-Arizona border and Upstate South Carolina.\n\n# Study supports wider use of watchful waiting for kids' ear infections\n\nNews brief\n\nToday at 2:39 p.m.\n\n[Chris Dall, MA](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chris-dall-ma)\n\nTopics\n\n[Antimicrobial Stewardship](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship)\n\n![Child having ear examined](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/ear%20exam%20tot.jpg)Ivan-balvan / iStock\n\nA new [study](https://academic.oup.com/jpids/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jpids/piaf104/8321658 \"(opens in a new window)\") of children with ear infections suggests that wider uptake of \"watchful waiting\" could help reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, US researchers reported yesterday in the _Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society._\n\nLed by researchers with the University of Utah and Intermountain Health, the multicenter, retrospective observational study analyzed data on children ages six months to 17 years who received a diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM) in ambulatory practice settings at health systems in Illinois, Colorado, and Utah from July 2018 through December 2023.\n\nThe aim was to determine visits in which children received an immediate antibiotic prescription (within 2 days of the index visit) and those that used watchful waiting, a strategy that can involve monitoring symptoms and prescribing an antibiotic only if it's needed, or a delayed antibiotic prescription. The researchers also evaluated the outcomes associated with the two approaches.\n\nThe study authors note that roughly 100 million antibiotic courses are prescribed for children with AOM annually, though over 80% of cases resolve on their own.\n\n\"Randomized clinical trials have shown that watchful waiting can reduce antibiotic use for AOM by approximately 60% with similar patient outcomes and parent satisfaction to immediate antibiotic use,\" the authors wrote. \"Despite these favorable data, evidence suggests watchful waiting is utilized in only 5-20% of cases.\"\n\n### Favorable clinical outcomes\n\nOf the 140,579 visits for AOM, an immediate antibiotic was prescribed in 84.4%, and watchful waiting was used in 15.6%. Of the watchful-waiting patients, 56% were not prescribed an antibiotic, and 44% received a delayed prescription. Rates of treatment failure and recurrence were low in both groups, with only 6% of the watchful-waiting group and 7% of the immediate antibiotic group receiving any antibiotic 3 to 30 days after the index visit.\n\n\"When watchful waiting was utilized, clinical outcomes were favorable as evidenced by the infrequent need for a new antibiotic prescription in the 30 days after the index visit,\" the authors wrote. \"Interventions to scale up use of watchful waiting for AOM may therefore be a high-yield approach to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure for children with AOM.\"\n\n# WHO deploys aid to Ethiopia after 8 suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported\n\nNews brief\n\nToday at 2:32 p.m.\n\n[Mary Van Beusekom, MS](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mary-van-beusekom-ms)\n\nTopics\n\n[Viral Hemorrhagic Fever](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/viral-hemorrhagic-fever)\n\n![Workers moving a box](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/Viral%20hemorrhagic%20fever.png)_Photo: Sabin Vaccine Institute_\n\nEight suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever of unidentified cause in Ethiopia have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to dispatch a team of responders and deliver medical supplies to the southern part of the country, near its border with South Sudan.\n\nIn a [news release](https://www.afro.who.int/news/ethiopia-suspected-viral-haemorrhagic-fever-outbreak \"(opens in a new window)\") today, WHO Africa said that Ethiopian health authorities are ramping up their response and conducting lab tests to identify the cause of the infection and stop further transmission.\n\n\"To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement,\" the WHO wrote.\n\nEthiopia's Health Ministry will likely announce the results of the ongoing investigation tomorrow, according to [media reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/13/ethiopia-viral-hemorrhagic-fever-outbreak-who/22aa9f7e-c0a3-11f0-8eee-a78486b4c797_story.html \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\n### Provision of personal protective equipment, financial aid\n\nThe WHO is providing essential supplies such as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, infection-prevention materials, and a rapidly deployable isolation tent to improve clinical care and boost management capacity.\n\n> WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks.\n\nThe organization has also released $300,000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support and is marshaling technical capacity to support the response.\n\nViral hemorrhagic fevers, a group of epidemic-prone diseases caused by several distinct families of viruses, include Marburg, Ebola, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever.\n\nSigns and symptoms vary by virus, but initially they often include high fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, weakness, and exhaustion.

And although _S epidermidis_ is commonly found on human skin and is generally harmless, there is concern that drug-resistant strains in milk could spread resistance genes to more harmful bacteria like methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus._\n\n\"Given the public health implications of antibiotic-resistant _S. epidermidis_ in dairy production, it is essential to monitor the prevalence and resistance profiles of this pathogen in milk,\" the study authors wrote.\n\n### Half of _S epidermidis_ isolates are multidrug-resistant\n\nThe overall prevalence of subclinical mastitis was 26%, and 40 (12.9%) of the 310 milk samples collected tested positive for _S epidermidis._\n\nAntibiotic susceptibility tests showed high resistance rates (95%) to penicillin and erythromycin; moderate rates of resistance to cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol; and low rates of resistance to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Half of the _S epidermidis_ isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant.\n\nAmong the resistance genes identified, _ermC_ was most prevalent (87.5%), followed by _tetK_ (80%) and _mecA_ (45%).\n\nThe authors say widespread use of antibiotics to treat mastitis and other diseases of dairy cattle and sheep likely explains the high levels of resistance.\n\n\"The presence of multidrug-resistant _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ in raw milk highlights how on-farm antibiotic use directly shapes public health risks,\" they said in a journal [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1104689 \"(opens in a new window)\"). \"These findings emphasize the urgent need for responsible antibiotic use and improved hygiene practices in the dairy sector to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance transmission through the food chain.\"\n\n[ALL BRIEFS](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/search?type%5Bscan%5D=scan&sort_by=date)\n\n## In case you missed it\n\n[More avian flu detected on Indiana duck, chicken farms](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/more-avian-flu-detected-indiana-duck-chicken-farms)\n\n[13 cases of infant botulism tied to tainted baby formula](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/13-cases-infant-botulism-tied-tainted-baby-formula)\n\n[Ivermectin found to be safe, effective in small children with scabies](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/ivermectin-found-be-safe-effective-small-children-scabies)\n\n[Quick takes: Whooping cough in Texas, polio in 2 nations, Canada Salmonella outbreak](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/quick-takes-whooping-cough-texas-polio-2-nations-canada-salmonella-outbreak)\n\n[Measles count climbs in Arizona-Utah, South Carolina outbreaks](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-count-climbs-arizona-utah-south-carolina-outbreaks)\n\n[Kids with eczema may have fewer related infections, allergic complications after COVID vaccination](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kids-eczema-may-have-fewer-related-infections-allergic-complications-after-covid)\n\n[Resistance exercise boosts physical function, quality of life in COVID survivors](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/resistance-exercise-boosts-physical-function-quality-life-covid-survivors)\n\n[Quick takes: More infant botulism cases, measles in Louisiana, Ebola in DR Congo](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/quick-takes-more-infant-botulism-cases-measles-louisiana-ebola-dr-congo)\n\n[More avian flu detected on Indiana duck, chicken farms](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/more-avian-flu-detected-indiana-duck-chicken-farms)\n\n[13 cases of infant botulism tied to tainted baby formula](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/13-cases-infant-botulism-tied-tainted-baby-formula)\n\n[Ivermectin found to be safe, effective in small children with scabies](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/ivermectin-found-be-safe-effective-small-children-scabies)\n\n[Quick takes: Whooping cough in Texas, polio in 2 nations, Canada Salmonella outbreak](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/quick-takes-whooping-cough-texas-polio-2-nations-canada-salmonella-outbreak)\n\n[Measles count climbs in Arizona-Utah, South Carolina outbreaks](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-count-climbs-arizona-utah-south-carolina-outbreaks)\n\n[Kids with eczema may have fewer related infections, allergic complications after COVID vaccination](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/kids-eczema-may-have-fewer-related-infections-allergic-complications-after-covid)\n\n[Resistance exercise boosts physical function, quality of life in COVID survivors](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/resistance-exercise-boosts-physical-function-quality-life-covid-survivors)\n\n[Quick takes: More infant botulism cases, measles in Louisiana, Ebola in DR Congo](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/quick-takes-more-infant-botulism-cases-measles-louisiana-ebola-dr-congo)\n\n[More avian flu detected on Indiana duck, chicken farms](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/more-avian-flu-detected-indiana-duck-chicken-farms)\n\n[13 cases of infant botulism tied to tainted baby formula](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/13-cases-infant-botulism-tied-tainted-baby-formula)\n\n[Ivermectin found to be safe, effective in small children with scabies](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/ivermectin-found-be-safe-effective-small-children-scabies)\n\n[Quick takes: Whooping cough in Texas, polio in 2 nations, Canada Salmonella outbreak](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/quick-takes-whooping-cough-texas-polio-2-nations-canada-salmonella-outbreak)\n\n## This week's top reads\n\n01.

Canada lost its official measles elimination status this week; the United States could be next.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the U.S. passed a sobering milestone: the number of measles cases across the country reached its [**highest point in three decades**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000), with 1,281 cases reported — the most since the highly contagious disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. And the year was only half over. As of Nov. 4, that total had risen to [**1,681 confirmed cases**](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nTo find out where this is heading, look to Canada, which eliminated measles back in 1998. A deadly measles outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024 is still raging, with more than 5,100 cases reported since its start. On Nov. 10, 2025, the Pan American Health Organization, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional office for the Americas, [**revoked Canada's official measles-free status**](https://theconversation.com/canada-loses-its-official-measles-free-status-and-the-us-will-follow-soon-as-vaccination-rates-fall-269090).\n\nWill the U.S. be next?\n\n![U.S. map showing measles cases in 2025. source: Johns Hopkins University](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/cumulative-measles-cases-reported-in-the-united-states-in-2025-%20%282%29.png.webp?itok=KQYAWuct)\n\n## Childhood vaccination rates have been falling worldwide\n\nMeasles elimination is defined as the interruption of endemic measles virus transmission in a specific geographic area for more than 12 months. It's an epidemiological victory — but elimination can only last as long as vaccination rates remain sufficiently high.\n\nA safe and effective measles vaccine has been in use since the 1960s. But vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, and funding cuts are disrupting efforts to reach children with essential immunizations. [**Global childhood immunization rates stalled in 2023**](https://www.unicefusa.org/press/global-childhood-immunization-levels-stalled-2023-leaving-many-without-life-saving-protection), leaving 2.7 million additional children un- or under-vaccinated, compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to WHO and UNICEF data tracking immunization trends for vaccination against 14 diseases. Measles cases surged in 2023, infecting an estimated 10.3 million people worldwide, up 22 percent from the year before. That year, 107,500 people lost their lives to measles. The overwhelming majority were children under 5.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Mexico have had sustained measles outbreaks since early 2025, putting them on track to lose their measles-free status in 2026.\n\n_**Related:**_ [_**Americans Who Never Forget: Life Without Vaccines**_](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/americans-who-never-forget-life-without-vaccines)\n\n## As measles cases surge, here are five things to know:\n\n### 1\\. Measles can be deadly.\n\n[**Measles**](https://what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization/measles) kills nearly 300 people every day, approximately 12 people every hour, mostly children under 5. Even when children survive a measles infection, the virus can leave them with long-term health effects or permanent disabilities.\n\nIn some cases, severe complications can include pneumonia, severe diarrhea, blindness and encephalitis (brain swelling). It can also weaken a child’s immune system and make them more vulnerable to other infections long after recovering from measles, a phenomenon known as immunity amnesia.\n\nAny child who is unprotected from measles through immunization is at risk, with malnourished children and those under 5 most at risk.\n\n![Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their ext…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI677988.jpg.webp?itok=UeCEte8e)Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their extended family. Their cousins were infected with the measles virus during an outbreak in the region. Despite the outbreak, the cousins' parents were hesitant about vaccinating their children. With the guidance and assistance of local health workers and leaders, they realized the importance of vaccines in keeping their children safe, and  decided to allow them to be vaccinated following their recovery from the disease. © UNICEF/U.S. CDC/UNI677988/Amanda VoisardMore\n\n### 2\\. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious airborne disease. It can spread easily as infected people breath, cough or sneeze, releasing virus particles into the air and onto surfaces that can remain infectious for up to two hours. Unfortunately, those infected with the virus can start to spread measles to others even before they know they have it — four days before the characteristic measles rash appears.\n\nOnce a child is infected with measles, 90 percent of those they come into close contact with will become infected, if they are not already immune.\n\nThe measles virus does not recognize borders. Over the past five years, measles outbreaks have hit over 100 countries, including several that had previously eliminated measles altogether.\n\n### 3\\. Vaccines are the best way to stop outbreaks and protect children.\n\nMeasles vaccines are safe. Two doses of a measles-containing vaccine provide 99 percent protection from measles for life. They are the best way to prevent children from contracting measles and spreading the disease to others. No child should risk serious health complications or death by contracting measles.\n\nSince 1974, measles vaccines have saved nearly 94 million lives. They have protected more people than any other vaccine in the [**Essential Program on Immunization**](https://www.unicef.org/blog/legacy-progress-future-promise \"A legacy of progress, a future of promise\").\n\nWhile most countries now include measles vaccines in their immunization schedules, too many children are still unprotected. The story of unvaccinated children is one of inequity, poverty and underserved communities.\n\n![A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on J…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI514454%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=7WEpTkUG)A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on Jan. 26, 2024. © UNICEF/UNI514454/Elfatih\n\n### 4\\. Low vaccination coverage is contributing to measles outbreaks.\n\nBecause measles spreads so quickly, maintaining high vaccination rates across communities is critical to preventing outbreaks. Coverage of 95 percent or greater with two doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed to protect communities from measles outbreaks. All children should be vaccinated against measles.\n\nCurrently, the global coverage rate of the first dose of the measles vaccine is 83 percent, and the second dose is just 74 percent, far below the level needed for protection. This leaves room for measles to spread and puts vulnerable groups, including unvaccinated children, at higher risk.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for ending outbreaks and reducing global measles deaths.\n\n### 5\\. A switch to five-dose vials can help governments save more lives.\n\nMeasles vaccines are often purchased in ten-dose vials. Once opened, health workers only have a few hours to administer all ten doses to children. Any unused doses will expire and must be thrown away.\n\nHealth workers can sometimes be hesitant to open a new vial for only one or two children, knowing the rest of the doses will go to waste. This hesitation and fear of wastage too often leads to unopened vials, leaving children without the shots needed to protect them from measles.\n\n**A simple** [**switch from ten-dose to five-dose vials**](https://www.unicef.org/supply/switching-ten-dose-five-dose-vials-may-equal-more-children-vaccinated-measles) **can help increase measles vaccination coverage and reduce wastage.**\n\n![On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Su…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI797774.jpg.webp?itok=D5R24uC7)On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Sudan, during a six-day catch-up campaign. “This was the first vaccination campaign since the conflict ended in Al Jazirah,” said Aseel Abbas, a health officer and supervisor of the campaign. “The campaign is important because measles can affect a child’s hearing, vision, movement and development.” © UNICEF/UNI797774/AbdulmajidMore\n\n## **UNICEF’s role in combatting measles**\n\nUNICEF’s mission is to [**reach every single child with lifesaving vaccines**](https://www.unicefusa.org/what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization).\n\nEach year, UNICEF delivers around 250 million doses of measles-containing vaccines.

All other countries continue to maintain their measles elimination status.\n\n“This loss represents a setback—but it is also reversible,” said Dr. Barbosa, “Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our Region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the Region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement.”\n\n## Current situation\n\nAs of 7 November 2025, 12,596 confirmed measles cases have been reported across ten countries (approximately 95% of the Region’s cases in Canada, Mexico and US), a 30-fold increase compared to 2024. Twenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, 3 in the United States, and 2 in Canada.\n\nActive outbreaks are ongoing in Canada, Mexico, the United States, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize, mostly triggered by imported cases. Transmission has primarily affected under-vaccinated communities, with 89% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. Children under 1 year of age are the most affected, followed by those aged one to four years.\n\nCanada’s measles outbreak began in October 2024 in the province of New Brunswick and has since spread nationwide, with more than 5,000 confirmed cases reported nationwide. Although declining, transmission persists in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.\n\nMeasles is highly contagious. A single infected person can transmit it to up to 18 others. Severe complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and death. Outbreaks also disrupt daily life and place additional pressure on health systems.\n\nVaccination remains the most effective means of protection. Over the past 25 years, the measles vaccine has prevented more than six million deaths across the Americas —and an estimated 15 million deaths over the last 50 years. Nevertheless, in 2024, regional coverage for the second dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR2) averaged 79%—well below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In addition, only 31% of countries reached 95% or more coverage for the first dose, and just 20% achieved that level for the second dose.\n\n## PAHO’s response and recommendations\n\nPAHO continues to provide technical support to countries to strengthen surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, outbreak response, and vaccination campaigns. Experts have been deployed to Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia, and the organization is monitoring risks in Belize, Brazil and Paraguay.\n\nDr. Barbosa emphasized: “Every case we prevent, every outbreak we stop saves lives, protects families, and makes communities healthier. Today, rather than lamenting the loss of a regional status, we call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases—reaching every corner of the Americas. As a Region, we have eliminated measles twice. We can do it a third time.”\n\n**RVC strongly encourages countries to:**\n\n- Continue strengthening surveillance, immunization and outbreak rapid response activities for every suspect case.\n- Expand and consolidate electronic immunization registries across all countries, following PAHO’s established guidelines.\n- Maintain sustainable laboratory surveillance by allocating sufficient financial and human resources.\n- For suspected cases with clinical and epidemiological risk factors and a negative measles IgM result (with specimens collected within 0–3 days after rash onset), perform PCR testing to confirm or rule out infection.\n- Implement all recommendations down to the local level.\n- Document outbreak closure following the [Regional Framework](https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/56855) guidelines.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe Americas have previously faced setbacks, including temporary loss of measles elimination status in Venezuela (2018) and Brazil (2019). The region regained elimination status in 2024 through coordinated regional action.\n\nTo regain measles elimination status, a country must demonstrate interruption of endemic transmission for at least 12 consecutive months, supported by comprehensive vaccination, surveillance, and outbreak-response data.\n\nCanada will now present and implement an action plan under PAHO’s regional framework, focused on boosting immunization coverage, reinforcing surveillance systems, and ensuring rapid outbreak response to stop endemic transmission and regaining measles elimination status.\n\n“Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus—because when we work together, we protect the health and lives of all people in the Americas,” Dr. Barbosa concluded.\n\n[News Releases](https://www.paho.org/en/news/news-releases)\n\n[Measles](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles)\n\n[Brasil](https://www.paho.org/pt/brasil)\n\n[Comprehensive Immunization (CIM)](https://www.paho.org/en/comprehensive-immunization-cim)\n\n## Latest news\n\n[![Measles patient](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/measles-patient.jpg?h=ae97dba1&itok=bnGMZyUl)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n[PAHO calls for regional action as the Americas lose measles elimination status](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n10 Nov 2025\n\n[![Arrival of aid to Jamaica](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/emt-aecid-llegada.jpg?h=eed8f32f&itok=Hh60dlMe)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n[PAHO scales up its emergency health response across the Caribbean following Hurricane Melissa](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[![Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO, Florika Fink-Hooijer, Director-General of HERA, and European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, who oversees HERA within the European Commission.](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/acuerdo-comision-europea.jpg?h=717d0fcf&itok=qG_9hwe-)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n[PAHO and European Commission’s Health Emergency Authority make deal to boost preparedness for cross-border health threats](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[See all the news](https://www.paho.org/en/news)",

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",
