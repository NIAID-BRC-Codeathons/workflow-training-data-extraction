Despite bearing a significant disease burden, African nations continue to face delays in vaccine acquisition and distribution, reflecting more profound structural and historical inequities.\n\n### Methods\n\nThis systematic review synthesizes literature published between 2016 and 2024, including peer-reviewed articles, policy documents, and institutional reports. The review aims to explore the dynamics of MPOX outbreaks in Africa, patterns of vaccine inequity, and the systemic limitations that hinder local response capacity. A narrative synthesis approach was employed to analyze data relating to vaccine access, production capacity, regulatory environments, and structural determinants of health.\n\n### Results\n\nThe findings reveal Africa’s continued dependency on external vaccine sources, shaped by colonial legacies and weak local pharmaceutical systems. During the 2022 global MPOX outbreak, high-income countries swiftly secured vaccine supplies, while African nations experienced significant delays despite high transmission rates. Although efforts to establish local manufacturing are emerging, they are constrained by limited infrastructure, fragmented regulatory systems, shortages of skilled workers, and restrictive intellectual property regimes. Furthermore, the review identifies a need for harmonized regulatory frameworks and sustainable investment in regional manufacturing capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAddressing MPOX and future health threats in Africa demands a shift toward decolonized health systems that emphasize South-South collaboration, indigenous knowledge, and local ownership. Strategic interventions, such as regulatory harmonization, equitable technology transfer, and capacity-building, are essential to reduce external dependency. Coordinated short-term actions and long-term investments are crucial for fostering resilient, self-sustaining health systems that can respond effectively to emerging infectious diseases.\n\n**Keywords:** MPOX, Vaccine, Disease outbreaks, Decolonizing global health\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe recent outbreak of MPOX, a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus, has affected several African nations, including Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kenya, raising significant concerns about the continent’s preparedness for health emergencies \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR1)\\]. MPOX has manifested in sporadic global outbreaks historically endemic to Central and West Africa. However, the episodes documented in 2022 and 2023 reveal the continent’s persistent vulnerability to this disease, primarily exacerbated by reliance on international vaccine supplies and external health initiatives \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR2)\\].\n\nAfrica’s response to MPOX outbreaks has been significantly constrained by the stark imbalance in global vaccine distribution and limited local production capabilities \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR3)\\]. Specifically, as of November 2024, the Access and Allocation Mechanism (AAM) for mpox has allocated only 899,000 vaccine doses for nine African countries hardest hit by the current outbreak, while by September 2024, of the 20.5 million vaccine doses required for Africa, only 5.6 million had been allocated, representing a 73% shortage \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR4), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR5)\\]. This disparity is further illustrated by Africa confirming 2,863 cases and 517 deaths in 2024, primarily in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with suspected cases surging past 17,000 \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR6)\\]. Additionally, vaccination has not yet started for children, one of the hardest-hit groups, because of regulatory and supply issues \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR7)\\].”\n\nWhile most African nations have been independent for decades, the structural dependencies created by colonial health systems, including reliance on external expertise, donor-driven priorities, and limited local research capacity, continue to influence current vaccine access patterns during the MPOX response \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR8)\\]. However, these historical factors interact with contemporary challenges such as poor governance, resource constraints, and global power asymmetries in pharmaceutical markets \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR9)\\].\n\nThese challenges are partly shaped by historical legacies that constrained Africa’s industrial and regulatory base, but are more directly explained by proximal health system factors, including weak governance capacity, health workforce shortages, limited fiscal space, fragmented service integration, and supply-chain bottlenecks \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR10)\\]. The consequences were evident in MPOX-specific outcomes: although the World Health Organization (WHO) first declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 23 July 2022 \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR11)\\], African countries experienced delays in vaccine access, particularly in the DRC. Despite having over 20,000 cases, the country received its first vaccine shipment only on September 5, 2024, while European and North American countries had stockpiled millions of doses from the 2022 outbreak \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR12)\\]. WHO later declared a second PHEIC on 14 August 2024, in recognition of the escalating outbreak across Africa \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR13)\\].\n\nCurrent initiatives, such as the European Commission-coordinated 215,000-dose donation and the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator’s financing mechanisms, illustrate how present-day governance, financing, and procurement reforms, rather than history alone, are critical to strengthening Africa’s outbreak response capacity \\[ [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR14)\\].\n\nThis literature review examines the complexities of MPOX outbreaks in Africa, emphasizing the need to establish local vaccine manufacturing capabilities and advocate for decolonized health systems as sustainable approaches to addressing these public health challenges.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, policy documents, and institutional reports on monkeypox (MPOX) in Africa published between 2016 and 2024. Our primary objective was to explore outbreak patterns, vaccine supply systems, inequities, and the implications of structural dependencies on Africa’s health systems. To ensure methodological rigor, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines.\n\nStudy identification and selection were carried out using a predefined search strategy. We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using Boolean search terms such as “Monkeypox,” “MPOX,” “vaccine equity,” “Africa,” “decolonized health systems,” “epidemic preparedness,” and “local vaccine manufacturing.” Additional grey literature was sourced from the websites of the WHO, the Africa Center for Disease Control (CDC), and national public health authorities.\n\nStudies were excluded based on the following pre-defined criteria: (1) review articles and meta-analyses to focus on primary research; (2) preprint publications not yet peer-reviewed to ensure quality assurance; (3) studies with unclear or insufficient data reporting that precluded meaningful analysis; (4) studies not primarily focused on the African context or MPOX; (5) conference abstracts and editorials lacking comprehensive methodology. Following these exclusions, 76 records underwent full-text screening for abstract quality, title relevance, and overall methodological rigor using standardized assessment criteria. Studies with inadequate sample sizes, poor methodological design, or insufficient reporting of outcomes were further excluded, resulting in 31 records for final inclusion in the systematic review.\n\nWe found 3,842 studies, including 1,247 on MPOX epidemiology, 968 on vaccine accessibility and manufacturing, 614 on regulatory frameworks, 452 on economic impacts, and 561 on health system decolonization. Of these, 3,356 were duplicates or failed the initial screening criteria, leaving 486 records eligible for further review. 410 studies were excluded for specific reasons (methodology concerns, insufficient focus on Africa, and a lack of empirical data), leaving 76 studies for final evaluation and comprehensive review. This rigorous selection process ensured that our analysis was based on the most relevant and methodologically sound research on MPOX in Africa (Fig. [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#Fig1)).\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n[![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0b03/12595634/bf7d4f3a0022/12889_2025_25120_Fig1_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12595634_12889_2025_25120_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/figure/Fig1/)\n\nPRISMA flow diagram table for MPOX review\n\n### Dynamics of MPOX epidemics in Africa\n\n#### Historical context and epidemiology of MPOX\n\nMPOX is a zoonotic disease caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPXV), a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus and a close relative of the smallpox-causing variola virus \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR15)\\]. The disease’s documented history in Africa began in 1970, when the first human case was recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since this initial identification, MPOX has maintained a persistent presence across several African countries, with periodic outbreaks predominantly occurring throughout Central and West Africa \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR16)\\]. The epidemiological landscape of MPOX in Africa has undergone a substantial transformation since 2022. The virus garnered unprecedented global attention when it rapidly spread across more than 100 countries, resulting in over 80,000 cases worldwide, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare MPOX a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and officially rename the disease from monkeypox to MPOX to mitigate stigmatization; however, the WHO declared an end to the MPOX PHEIC on September 5, 2025 \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR17)\\]. However, the 2024 resurgence has revealed more complex transmission dynamics specific to the African context. Recent comprehensive analyses \\[ [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR18)\\] demonstrate that the evolving epidemiology of MPOX in Africa during 2024 shows distinct patterns compared to the 2022 global outbreak, with increased human-to-human transmission chains and altered demographic distributions. The epidemiological data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) reveal troubling shifts in MPOX transmission patterns across the continent, with cases increasing by over 160% in 2024 compared to previous years \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR19)\\]. Contemporary research \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR20)\\] identifies multiple interconnected drivers behind the MPOX resurgence in Africa, including environmental degradation leading to increased human-wildlife contact, weakened health systems following COVID-19, population displacement caused by conflict, and inadequate surveillance infrastructure in rural areas. These findings challenge previous assumptions about MPOX transmission being limited to specific high-risk populations. The complexity of MPOX epidemiology in Central Africa has been further elucidated by Halbrook et al. in 2024, who argue that the interconnected nature of transmission requires a “constellation approach” that considers zoonotic reservoirs, human behavioral factors, healthcare accessibility, and socioeconomic determinants simultaneously \\[ [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR21)\\]. This multifaceted perspective is critical given that Central Africa continues to bear the highest burden of MPOX cases globally. Recent concurrent outbreaks across multiple African countries, as documented by Beiras et al. in 2025, demonstrate unprecedented geographic spread and temporal clustering, suggesting enhanced viral transmission capacity or improved detection systems \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR22)\\]. The authors note that simultaneous outbreaks in previously unaffected regions indicate either viral adaptation or the unveiling of existing transmission networks through enhanced surveillance. A significant increase in cases has been observed, particularly among populations previously considered low-risk, including children under 15 years who now represent approximately 39% of cases in some regions \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR19)\\]. This demographic shift raises concerns about potential viral evolution, changes in transmission modes, or whether improved diagnostic capabilities and enhanced surveillance systems are now detecting previously unrecognized cases.\n\nThe expanding geographical footprint of MPOX is evidenced by outbreaks in previously unaffected countries, including Gabon and Rwanda, which reported their first cases in 2022. Before this global outbreak, Nigeria had experienced a notable resurgence in 2017, reporting over 200 confirmed cases with an estimated 3% fatality rate, while the Central African Republic documented several outbreaks between 2018 and 2020, resulting in 49 confirmed cases \\[ [23](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR23)\\]. MPOX’s capacity to spread globally was first demonstrated in 2003 when the United States reported 47 confirmed cases linked to animals imported from Ghana. In 2018, the United Kingdom identified multiple cases associated with travellers from Nigeria. These cases, combined with the recent global outbreak, have generated sizable concern regarding the virus’s evolution and its potential for broader geographical dissemination \\[ [24](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR24)\\].\n\nThere are several reasons why MPOX is spreading more rapidly. One of them is that smallpox vaccination campaigns stopped more than 40 years ago, after smallpox was eradicated in 1980. This means that people born after the vaccination stopped do not have cross-protective immunity against MPOX \\[ [25](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR25)\\]. Additional contributing factors include increased human-wildlife interactions resulting from deforestation and agricultural expansion, insufficient public health infrastructure (particularly in rural areas), delays in vaccine allocation to high-risk groups, and enhanced diagnostic capabilities that may uncover previously undetected cases \\[ [26](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR26)\\]. The loss of population-level immunity from smallpox vaccination is particularly significant in Africa, where most younger individuals have no vaccination-derived protection, representing the majority of the current population and contributing substantially to increased susceptibility to MPOX infection \\[ [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR27)\\].\n\nDespite being the most severely impacted region, Africa faces significant obstacles in addressing MPOX outbreaks due to insufficient vaccine access and compromised public health infrastructure. In 2022, the WHO reported over 7,500 confirmed cases in Africa, with the DRC and Nigeria experiencing the most severe outbreaks \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR17)\\]. These challenges are further compounded by healthcare systems already overburdened with endemic diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, reinforcing the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to effectively address the emerging MPOX situation across the continent \\[ [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR28)\\].\n\n### Vaccine accessibility and production\n\n#### Global vaccine distribution: inequities and obstacles\n\nCurrently, two primary vaccines are approved for MPOX prevention: JYNNEOS (also known as Imvamune or Imvanex), manufactured by Bavarian Nordic in Denmark, and ACAM2000, produced by Emergent BioSolutions in the United States \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR29)\\]. JYNNEOS is a third-generation, live, non-replicating vaccinia virus vaccine that can be administered to immunocompromised individuals, while ACAM2000 is a second-generation, live, replicating smallpox vaccine with higher risks of adverse effects, particularly contraindicated in immunocompromised populations \\[ [30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR30)\\]. Additional vaccines in development include LC16m8 (Japan) and LCMV-based vaccines, though these remain in experimental phases \\[ [31](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR31)\\].\n\nVaccines are a significant component of MPOX control efforts; however, the distribution of MPOX vaccines highlights a notable disparity between African nations and the Global North, reminiscent of the inequities faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being the most affected region during health crises, Africa consistently struggles to secure adequate vaccine supplies, largely due to its reliance on international organizations such as the WHO for procurement and distribution \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR32)\\].\n\nThe 2022 global MPOX outbreak illustrated this issue vividly. Wealthy nations, including the U.S., Canada, and several European countries, swiftly deployed vaccines and stockpiled large quantities. The U.S. allocated over 1 million vials of the Jynneos vaccine between 2022 and 2024, with a focus on high-risk groups \\[ [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR33)\\]. The U.K. and Canada followed suit, amassing substantial reserves for their populations \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR34), [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR35)\\]. Additionally, the U.S. had long prepared for future outbreaks by stockpiling ACAM2000, an alternative smallpox vaccine, despite its higher risk of adverse effects compared to Jynneos \\[ [36](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR36)\\].\n\nIn stark contrast, early access to vaccines in several African countries was limited and delayed. Nigeria received 10,000 donated JYNNEOS doses in August 2024, with rollout commencing in November 2024; \\[ [37](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR37)\\]. Rwanda began vaccination in September 2024 using 1,000 doses transferred from Nigeria and later received 5,420 additional doses via the EU’s HERA \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR7)\\], and the DRC’s first shipments, approximately 200,000 doses, arrived in early September 2024 \\[ [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR38)\\]. These patterns primarily reflected constrained global supply, early bilateral purchases and stockpiling by high-income countries, and the absence of a UN procurement pathway until WHO prequalification of MVA-BN in September 2024, rather than any policy to prioritise high-income countries by WHO or Gavi \\[ [39](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR39)\\].\n\nThese inequities reflect multiple barriers: the purchasing power and political influence of wealthier nations, the absence of organized procurement mechanisms for low-income countries, limited financial capacity to independently secure vaccines, and weak surveillance/reporting systems that delay timely allocation \\[ [40](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR40)\\]. Structural limitations thus compound supply challenges, leaving Africa heavily dependent on international organizations such as WHO and Gavi, which have historically prioritized developed nations in distribution \\[ [32](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR32)\\]. Another overlooked factor is vaccine hesitancy and acceptance, which shape uptake even when vaccines are available. Recent studies highlight significant variation in willingness to receive MPOX vaccines globally. A 2024 systematic review reported wide disparities in acceptance, influenced by sociodemographic factors and trust in public health authorities \\[ [41](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR41)\\]. Similarly, a multinational survey across African countries found that prior vaccination coverage, misinformation, and weak confidence in health systems strongly influenced hesitancy \\[ [42](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR42)\\]. Taken together, inequities in supply, weak procurement and surveillance infrastructures, and challenges of hesitancy underscore the urgent need for a restructured global vaccine access framework that prioritizes timely and equitable allocation. Beyond procurement, strategies must also address demand-side barriers by investing in community engagement, transparent communication, and building trust to ensure vaccines are both available and acceptable. Addressing these inequities is both a moral imperative and a necessity for effective global disease control and prevention.\n\n#### Local vaccine manufacturing: progress and barriers\n\nAfrica’s continued reliance on external vaccine sources represents both a public health vulnerability and a missed economic opportunity. The Africa CDC’s projection of 10 million needed MPOX vaccine doses starkly contrasts with the continent’s minimal manufacturing capacity, highlighting the urgent need for self-sufficiency \\[ [43](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR43)\\]. The WHO’s MPOX emergency declaration in 2022 brought global attention but little practical change to Africa’s vaccine access problem \\[ [44](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR44)\\].\n\nIn recent years, a diverse vaccine manufacturing ecosystem has begun to emerge across the continent. Emerging initiatives at institutions like Senegal’s Pasteur Institute and South Africa’s Biovac represent promising first steps toward independence \\[ [45](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR45)\\]. Alongside these established players, the African Vaccine Manufacturing Initiative (AVMI) has played a central role in coordinating stakeholders, advocating for policy reforms, and advancing the AU’s 2040 target of producing 60% of vaccines locally \\[ [46](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR46)\\]. Investments are also supported by continental strategies such as the Partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM), which seeks to align donor funding, technology transfer, and capacity building \\[ [47](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR47)\\]. African leadership has embraced this vision, setting an ambitious target of 60% local production for medical products by 2040 \\[ [48](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR48)\\]. Several reports emphasize that progress is visible but uneven. For example, Wellcome Trust in 2023 notes that while funding commitments have grown, financing gaps and overreliance on donor-driven models persist \\[ [49](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR49)\\]. Structural barriers such as high capital costs, limited technology transfer, shortages in the skilled workforce, and fragmented regulatory systems continue to impede rapid progress \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR50)\\]. Workforce development and training are particularly urgent, as highlighted by a study conducted by Kim et al. in 2025, who stress that vaccine inequities during COVID-19 exposed critical gaps in Africa’s biomedical R&D capacity and clinical trial infrastructure \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR51)\\].\n\nImportantly, policy opportunities exist as Doua et al. argue that local manufacturing is not just a technical challenge but a political priority, requiring African governments to create enabling policy environments, invest in infrastructure, and negotiate more equitable global partnerships \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR50)\\]. Similarly, Kim et al. in 2025 identify South-South collaborations and regional clinical trial platforms as promising mechanisms for reducing dependency on the Global North \\[ [51](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR51)\\].\n\nHowever, the path to manufacturing independence faces formidable obstacles that extend beyond building physical facilities. Some of the primary barriers include restrictive intellectual property regimes that block technology transfer, infrastructure limitations, critical skills shortages in specialized production and quality assurance roles, and regulatory fragmentation across the continent. Equally, sustained government commitment that goes beyond political rhetoric at continental and regional levels remains a crucial challenge, as policy pronouncements often fail to translate into actionable long-term investments \\[ [52](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR52), [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR53)\\]. These challenges reflect historical power dynamics in global health, where African nations have been positioned as consumers rather than producers of medical technologies.\n\nThe road to vaccine independence will require a dual strategy: leveraging strategic international partnerships for immediate capacity building while systematically developing sovereign capabilities. During this transition, Africa will continue to need external expertise and materials \\[ [54](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR54)\\], but these relationships must be restructured as equitable partnerships centered on knowledge transfer rather than perpetual dependence.\n\nSuccess will demand sustained investment in human capital development, regulatory harmonization across African regions, and negotiated intellectual property arrangements that prioritize public health over market exclusivity. Through this approach, Africa can gradually transform from a passive recipient of global health assistance to an active contributor to worldwide vaccine security.\n\n### The case for decolonizing African health systems\n\nThe colonial imprint on African vaccine manufacturing extends beyond physical infrastructure to governance models, funding relationships, and knowledge systems that perpetuate dependency in pharmaceutical production. Colonial legacies in vaccine manufacturing varied significantly across different colonial powers and regions. French colonial territories developed pharmaceutical systems oriented toward metropolitan needs, as seen in Senegal’s Institut Pasteur, while British colonies were integrated into centralized London-based production networks \\[ [55](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR55)\\]. The minimal pharmaceutical production capacity in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a direct consequence of a colonial-era economic design, where Belgian policy intentionally suppressed local manufacturing by constructing infrastructure solely for resource extraction \\[ [56](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR56)\\]. This historical underdevelopment path-dependency resulted in an industrial base incapable of producing essential goods. Consequently, the DRC, like most African nations, remains dependent on importing 90–95% of its medicines, a critical vulnerability identified in recent analyses \\[ [57](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR57)\\]. These differentiated colonial experiences are now being reshaped through African regulatory leadership. While Francophone countries historically maintained regulatory dependencies on European systems and Anglophone nations operated through WHO prequalification frameworks \\[ [58](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR58)\\], regional initiatives such as the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF) and the establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) in 2021 have created unified, African-controlled regulatory pathways that transcend colonial divisions \\[ [59](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR59), [60](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR60)\\]. Furthermore, the progress of several African countries in reaching WHO Maturity Level 3 (ML3) status, including Egypt and South Africa, signals the capacity of African regulatory systems to align with international standards while maintaining sovereign control \\[ [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR61)– [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR63)\\].\n\nAfrican regulatory authorities face significant challenges in approving timely medical interventions due to limited expertise, limited capacity, and underutilized reliance mechanisms. Many countries do not invest enough in their regulatory infrastructure, resulting in delays during health emergencies like the MPOX outbreak \\[ [64](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR64)– [66](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR66)\\]. However, several African countries have demonstrated remarkable regulatory leadership through initiatives such as AMA \\[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR67)\\], AVAREF \\[ [68](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR68)\\], and capacity-building efforts supported by the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) \\[ [69](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR69)\\]. These examples illustrate Africa’s potential for regulatory excellence when proper investment and support mechanisms are in place.\n\nA decolonized vaccine manufacturing framework builds directly on these demonstrated regulatory achievements through four evidence-based strategies: First, countries with ML3 regulatory status can negotiate comprehensive technology transfer agreements rather than accepting limited fill-and-finish operations, as demonstrated by South Africa’s advanced pharmaceutical sector. Second, AMA provides African-controlled regulatory pathways that reduce dependence on former colonial regulatory systems. Third, regional manufacturing hubs can leverage AVAREF’s proven rapid approval capabilities to serve continental markets with locally prioritized vaccines, including measles-rubella, yellow fever, cholera, rotavirus, meningococcal, malaria, Ebola, pneumococcal, and Lassa fever \\[ [50](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR50)\\]. Fourth, community engagement models proven during successful Ebola vaccine campaigns can ensure broad acceptance and equitable distribution.\n\nThese strategies demonstrate that decolonization represents practical pharmaceutical sovereignty already being implemented across Africa. African regulatory excellence through AVAREF, AMA, and ML3-certified national agencies provides the institutional foundation for manufacturing independence, transforming the continent from a passive recipient of global health assistance to an active leader in pharmaceutical innovation and production.\n\n### African regulatory framework and prospects for accelerated vaccine production\n\nIn the face of recurrent health crises, Africa has begun to develop a more coordinated and robust pharmaceutical and vaccine regulatory infrastructure. These advances are exemplified by the efforts of AVAREF, which has played a pivotal role in streamlining clinical trial approvals and enhancing regulatory efficiency across the continent. During the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, AVAREF demonstrated its effectiveness by reducing vaccine trial approval timelines from an average of two years to under 60 days. This accomplishment illustrated the potential of regionally tailored regulatory mechanisms to accelerate access to essential health products without compromising safety \\[ [70](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR70)\\].\n\nBuilding on this momentum, the establishment of the AMA in 2021 marked a significant milestone in the continent’s push toward regulatory harmonization. As a continental authority, the AMA works in coordination with the African Union (AU) and eight recognized Regional Economic Communities (RECs) to create a unified framework for the approval, oversight, and distribution of pharmaceutical products \\[ [67](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR67)\\]. Parallel efforts, including the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization (AMRH) initiative and support from the West African Health Organization (WAHO), reflect a growing regional consensus around the need for collaborative regulatory solutions \\[ [71](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR71), [72](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR72)\\].\n\nAt the national level, several African countries have made notable progress in strengthening their regulatory capacity, particularly through their National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs). According to the WHO’s Global Benchmarking Tool, multiple African NRAs have now achieved Maturity Level 3 (ML3), signifying a stable and well-functioning regulatory system. As of 2024, the countries with NRAs operating at ML3 include Tanzania (2018), Ghana (2020), Egypt (2022), Nigeria (2022), South Africa (2022), and, more recently, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, and Senegal (2024). Notably, Egypt and South Africa have attained ML3 status specifically for vaccine production, while Tanzania, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Senegal have achieved ML3 for vaccines despite not currently producing them. This expanding regulatory competence represents a promising trend towards greater pharmaceutical sovereignty across the continent \\[ [61](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR61)– [63](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR63)\\]. Egypt and Nigeria have also shown notable progress in their pharmaceutical regulation, indicating a wider trend of regulatory improvement across the continent \\[ [73](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR73)\\].\n\nHowever, despite these advancements, several challenges continue to hinder the establishment of a fully autonomous and efficient pharmaceutical ecosystem in Africa. Regulatory fragmentation, with differing standards and approval processes across countries, impedes cross-border collaboration and delays regional vaccine access. In addition, many NRAs continue to struggle with limited financial resources and a shortage of trained personnel, which restricts their ability to consistently oversee vaccine development, authorization, and distribution. Addressing these systemic gaps is crucial for establishing a resilient pharmaceutical system that can respond promptly to public health emergencies, such as the MPOX outbreak \\[ [74](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR74)\\].\n\nThe MPOX outbreak’s regulatory failures directly inform the proposed African Emergency Use Authorization (AEUA) framework (Fig. [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#Fig2)). The DRC’s six-month delay in receiving vaccines, despite bearing the highest case burden, resulted from fragmented approval processes requiring separate negotiations with external authorities. The AEUA framework would enable continental emergency authorization through existing ML3-certified agencies, potentially reducing such delays from months to weeks. Similarly, regulatory barriers that prevented inter-country vaccine sharing during the 2024 outbreak demonstrate the need for streamlined reliance pathways outlined in the Local Manufacturing Independence Framework (Fig. [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#Fig3)). These frameworks transform Africa’s demonstrated regulatory excellence into operational pandemic response mechanisms, warranting serious consideration as evidence-based solutions derived from MPOX-specific bottlenecks.\n\n#### Fig. 2.\n\n[![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0b03/12595634/fd5d9961e94c/12889_2025_25120_Fig2_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12595634_12889_2025_25120_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/figure/Fig2/)\n\nTentative AUEA framework\n\n#### Fig. 3.\n\n[![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0b03/12595634/6b4e2597633a/12889_2025_25120_Fig3_HTML.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12595634_12889_2025_25120_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/figure/Fig3/)\n\nAEUA local manufacturing independence framework\n\nAs Africa enhances its vaccine manufacturing capacity, it is crucial to ensure that locally produced vaccines meet established global safety and efficacy standards. Regulatory bodies, including AVAREF and AMA, are pivotal in this endeavor \\[ [75](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR75)\\].\n\nThis regulatory evolution must also be accompanied by significant investments in workforce development, quality assurance systems, and post-market surveillance infrastructure. Additionally, incorporating indigenous knowledge systems and cultural practices into regulatory considerations can foster broader public trust and uptake. The recent launch of the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA), which has pledged up to $1 billion to support vaccine production and regulation, offers critical financial backing for these efforts \\[ [76](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR76)\\]. Together, these initiatives lay the groundwork for a future in which African countries can produce, regulate, and distribute vaccines in ways that are locally governed, internationally credible, and equitably accessible.\n\n### Economic impact of MPOX outbreaks and vaccine production in Africa\n\nThe economic implications of MPOX outbreaks in Africa are substantial and multifaceted. In the DRC alone, over 19,513 MPOX cases were reported before the 2024 emergency declaration with a case fatality rate of 3.1% \\[ [77](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR77)\\], imposing considerable costs on national health systems through surge demands for patient care, isolation facilities, medical supplies, and protective equipment. Quarantine measures for MPOX patients create additional economic burdens on the healthcare system. Indirect costs include workforce productivity losses, reduced tourism, and restricted cross-border trade. While investment in local vaccine manufacturing offers substantial benefits, it faces political and market pressures, as demonstrated by South Africa’s decision to procure vaccines from India despite hosting an mRNA hub, saving approximately $133 million over three years, but highlighting tensions between cost pressures and support for local production capacity \\[ [78](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR78)\\].\n\nAccording to the African Union, shifting from vaccine importation to domestic production could save the continent between $4 billion and $7 billion annually \\[ [79](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR79)\\]. These savings would result from reduced import costs, improved responsiveness to outbreaks, and decreased reliance on donor-funded procurement. Moreover, establishing local production capabilities generates broader economic spillovers. The infrastructure, skills, and technologies developed for vaccine manufacturing have the potential to catalyze growth in related sectors such as biotechnology, medical research, and pharmaceutical innovation \\[ [53](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR53)\\].\n\nThe benefits, however, come with challenges. High initial capital costs, uncertain market demand, and the need to meet international quality standards present considerable barriers. African manufacturers must compete with established global firms and navigate complex intellectual property regimes. Despite these hurdles, strategic partnerships can offer pathways forward. The collaboration between Aspen Pharmacare in South Africa and Johnson & Johnson for COVID-19 vaccine production stands as a powerful example of how public-private alliances can accelerate local production while ensuring quality and compliance with global standards \\[ [80](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12595634/#CR80)\\].\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed the risks of relying on global supply chains, highlighting the urgent need for regional self-sufficiency. Strengthening vaccine production in Africa is both a public health and economic imperative, offering greater control, faster access during outbreaks, and reduced vulnerability to external shocks. Though complex, local manufacturing is a strategic investment in health security and economic resilience, one with the potential to transform Africa’s future.\n\n### Study limitation\n\nWhile this review offers a valuable synthesis of current literature and emerging policy discussions on MPOX, local vaccine manufacturing, and decolonized health systems in Africa, a few limitations should be noted. First, publicly available data on vaccine production initiatives across the continent is still evolving, which may limit the granularity of insights into specific country-level capacities. Second, information on technology transfer agreements and collaborations with global pharmaceutical firms remains somewhat limited in scope and transparency, making it difficult to assess the full extent of progress in this area. Finally, although the discussion on decolonizing health systems is grounded in relevant scholarship, it may not fully reflect the breadth of stakeholder perspectives, particularly from community-level actors and traditional health systems.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe resurgence of MPOX in Africa underscores structural weaknesses in the continent’s health systems, compounded by global vaccine inequities and reliance on external actors. Despite bearing the highest burden, African countries again faced delays in vaccine access due to limited production capacity and fragmented regulation. Addressing these vulnerabilities requires building autonomous and resilient health systems, with local manufacturing, harmonized regulation, and stronger community leadership at the core. Realizing this vision demands sustained political commitment, equitable partnerships, and long-term investment. MPOX should serve not only as a warning but as a turning point toward health sovereignty and equity in global health governance.\n\n### Recommendations for policy and practice\n\nTo translate this vision into action, African governments should prioritize concrete measures that can realistically strengthen health sovereignty and vaccine access. Investments in local vaccine production must be combined with targeted incentives for regional research, clinical trials, and development to ensure that manufacturing hubs are supported by strong innovation ecosystems. Regional procurement mechanisms, coordinated by the African Union and the Africa CDC, should be strengthened to pool demand, reduce costs, and secure timely vaccine access. Regulatory harmonization should move beyond broad alignment toward building reliance pathways between national authorities and continental bodies such as the AMA and AVAREF, allowing rapid approval of emergency-use vaccines. Equally, governments should negotiate technology transfer agreements that guarantee full production capacities rather than limited “fill-and-finish” roles, while incentivizing public–private partnerships to mobilize long-term investment. Finally, embedding community participation, traditional health practices, and transparent communication within vaccine rollouts is essential to overcome hesitancy and strengthen uptake. Taken together, these actionable strategies provide a roadmap for building a resilient and self-sufficient African health system that can respond effectively to MPOX and future epidemics.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Luma Emma Ngonga for her technical support in the realization of this project.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nDRC\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\n\nAMA\n\nAfrican Medicine Agency\n\nAVAREF\n\nAfrican Vaccine Regulatory Forum\n\nPHEIC\n\nPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\n\nMPOX\n\nMonkeypox\n\nREC\n\nRegional Economic Committee\n\nAMRH\n\nAfrica Medicine Regulatory Harmonization\n\nWAHO\n\nWest African Health Organization\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nNRA\n\nNational Regulatory Agency\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome\n\nCDC\n\nCenter for Disease Control\n\nAU\n\nAfrican Union\n\nAAM\n\nAccess and Allocation Mechanism\n\nML3\n\nMaturity Level 3\n\n## Authors’ contributions\n\nANC conceptualised and designed this work.

The bulk – three million – are from Japan for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the epicentre of the outbreak. The US also promised one million vaccines this week.\n\nThe Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (​​Cepi) has allocated around $72 million (in partnership with vaccine producer BioNTech) for mpox vaccine development, and $145 million to support the expansion of the manufacturing capacity in Africa, especially in Rwanda, said Kaseya.\n\nBut only a small percentage of the vaccine donations have touched down on African soil. The DRC is due to roll out its vaccination efforts next week but it has to navigate poor roads, lack of trained staff and armed conflict.\n\nGiven the scarcity of vaccines, vaccines will be confined to priority groups starting with the contacts of confirmed cases and healthcare workers, explained Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC’s Chief of Staff, at a media briefing on Thursday.\n\n![](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ngongo-1024x546.jpg)Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC Chief of staff\n\nOthers priority groups are “key populations, meaning commercial sex workers and men and having sex with men”, children, people in refugee camps, prisoners, truck drivers, cross-border traders and those who are immunocompromised, particularly those living with HIV.\n\n![](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mpox-week-37-1024x573.jpg)\n\nFifteen African countries have reported mpox cases since the beginning of the year while a further 15 are vulnerable, Kaseya told the media briefing.\n\nIn the past week, 2,910 new cases have been reported but only 436 have been confirmed, said Kaseya. Since the beginning of the year, over 32,000 suspected cases have been reported yet less than one-fifth have been confirmed.\n\nMajor weaknesses in surveillance, laboratories and research are confounding efforts to stem the spread of mpox.\n\n“Our immediate priorities are enhanced surveillance, contact tracing and laboratory testing,” said Kaseya.\n\nOnly about half the suspected mpox cases are being tested, and around 40% positivity rate  – but the results were tainted by the quality of the specimens, poorly trained staff as well as tests picking up other diseases such as measles and chicken pox, explained Ngongo.\n\n![](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lab-performance.jpg)\n\nAbout a third of cases have no apparent links to other cases, but Ngongo said this was likely because contact tracing is weak – with health workers only reaching around 3% of those who had been in contact with cases.\n\n“Community-based surveillance is weak because the community health workers and community health programs have not been involved fully involved into the mpox response,” Ngongo noted.\n\nThe mpox incidence management team, headed by Africa CDC and WHO, is encouraging countries to increase the number of community health workers, and the DRC plans to roll out the 40,000 community networkers, he added.\n\n### **West’s failure to act on mpox Clade I**\n\n![](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kaseya1-1024x537.jpg)Africa CDC Director-General Dr Jean Kaseya.\n\nKaseya said that “our colleagues from Western countries” are also responsible for the huge rise in mpox cases in Africa.\n\n“When we had the mpox public health emergence of international concern in 2022, they focused just on Clade II because that was in Europe and the US. They knew that there was a Clade I in Africa but didn’t conduct research on Clade I.”\n\nClade I has mutated into Clade Ib, which appears more infectious and more deadly. But because of international neglect, there is no rapid test for Clade I.\n\n“We do not have a full understanding of the epidemiology of mpox and the transmission dynamics,” said Kaseya. “What are some of the factors that, for example, explain the high numbers of children that are being infected?\n\n“About 80% of unknowns are mostly because our colleagues and partners didn’t want to see the reality,” he added.\n\nAfrica CDC has also sounded the alarm about possible cross-border transmission via truck drivers, who were key in transmitting HIV across the continent.\n\n“Uganda’s 212 cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Knowing the cross border movement, mostly with truck drivers, and the weakness of our surveillance system, no one can say that these 212 suspected cases are accurate,” said Kaseya.\n\nHe also questioned whether Tanzania, which has not officially reported any cases, really is mpox-free given its proximity to affected neighbours.\n\nImage Credits: [Africa CDC](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/africa-raises-1-billion-to-combat-mpox/).\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/africa-raises-1-billion-to-combat-mpox/?share=twitter&nb=1)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)LinkedIn](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/africa-raises-1-billion-to-combat-mpox/?share=linkedin&nb=1)\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/africa-raises-1-billion-to-combat-mpox/?share=facebook&nb=1)\n- [Click to print (Opens in new window)Print](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/africa-raises-1-billion-to-combat-mpox/#print?share=print&nb=1)\n\nCombat the infodemic in health information and support health policy reporting from the global South.

Introduction\n\nFollowing the global surge in monkeypox (mpox) cases in 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that mpox was no longer a public health emergency of international concern. However, the WHO emphasized the need for a sustainable, long-term approach to managing the disease [\\[1\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0005). In August 2024, an outbreak of mpox re-emerged, prompting the WHO to once again declare it a public health emergency of international concern [\\[2\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0010). These recurring outbreaks place a significant strain on healthcare financing in Africa, leading to inadequate allocation of resources within an already overburdened healthcare system and raising the costs of out-of-pocket health expenses.\n\nThe financial implications of an epidemic outbreak cannot be overstated. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some African countries developed distinct health financing policies as part of their efforts to combat the pandemic and advance universal health coverage (UHC). While the financial impact of the pandemic has been severe worldwide, different regions and countries have experienced varying levels of impact, influenced by their specific health financing policies. Countries or regions that were less affected financially and economically by COVID-19 often share a common characteristic: robust health financing policies [\\[3\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0015). This study aims to provide an overview of health financing in Africa and to examine the impact of the re-emergence of mpox on health financing in the region.\n\n## 2\\. The overview of mpox re-emergence in Africa\n\nMonkeypox has re-emerged as an endemic outbreak of international concern, as declared by the WHO. Its impacts are gradually spreading across both local and global economies, affecting health system financing as a result. According to the WHO’s latest global mpox rapid risk assessment, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighboring countries are categorized as high-risk, while other African nations are considered moderate-risk [\\[1\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0005) ( [Fig. 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#f0005)).\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n[![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0350/11638650/300699ebae50/gr1.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=11638650_gr1.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/figure/f0005/)\n\nOverview of mpox re-emergence in Africa [\\[4\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0020).\n\nAs of October 20, 2024, 18 countries reported a total of 9,320 confirmed mpox cases, including 34 deaths. The highest case counts in 2024 have been recorded in Burundi (1,287 cases), Uganda (153 cases), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (7,534 cases). Due to limited diagnostic capacity in many African countries, a substantial number of suspected mpox cases that are clinically consistent with the disease go undiagnosed and unconfirmed [\\[4\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0020). The robustness of health financing in Africa significantly influences the economic impact of the outbreak, particularly on the people of the region.\n\n## 3\\. Health financing in Africa\n\nHealth financing is a crucial component of health systems, as it supports the goal of universal health coverage and enables efficient health service delivery. It influences the extent to which healthcare services are accessible to a population or country and reflects the level of financial protection provided to the population [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0025). Africa bears a disproportionate share of the global disease burden, yet it is one of the regions with the lowest healthcare resource allocation. In 2015, Africa accounted for less than 1 % of total global health expenditure—ten times lower than the rest of the world [\\[6\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0030) ( [Fig. 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#f0010)).\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n[![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0350/11638650/72e22268769d/gr2.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=11638650_gr2.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/figure/f0010/)\n\nHealth financing sources and corresponding expenditures over time in Africa [\\[7\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0035).\n\nHealth financing sources typically include domestic governments, donors (both domestic private donors and external donors), and individuals (through out-of-pocket spending). In 2001, African governments committed to allocating at least 15 % of their annual budgets to health financing, recognizing the importance of health to economic development [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0025). However, more than 20 years later, only a few countries have met this target. The average allocation of government budgets to healthcare across Africa is 7.2 %—less than half of the agreed target. In response to this limited governmental investment, other health financing sources have increased, particularly household out-of-pocket (OOP) spending. OOP expenditures make up over 35 % of current health expenditure (CHE) in Sub-Saharan Africa, the second-highest rate globally after South Asia. A 2017 report indicated that OOP spending in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Sudan accounted for over 70 % of CHE in Sub-Saharan Africa [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0025). This reliance on OOP spending forces many households to dedicate a substantial portion of their income to healthcare, heightening their risk of poverty.\n\nHistorically, donor support has been a valuable component of health financing in Africa, yet it is unsustainable as a primary funding source. Health financing should not rely on the goodwill of other countries or organizations. In most Sub-Saharan African nations, donor funding contributes less than 20 % to CHE, though in countries like Malawi and Mozambique, donor funds account for as much as 60 % of CHE [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0025). Regardless of the proportion, donor-dependent financing is particularly unreliable during health emergencies. Donor funds are often designated for specific health programs—such as vaccination, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and, more recently, maternal and child health—limiting their flexibility for broader healthcare needs [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0025).\n\n## 4\\. Impact of Mpox on health financing\n\nOf the estimated $245 million needed to combat the growing mpox outbreak in Africa, less than 10 % has been secured [\\[8\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0040). Currently, no donor funds are available to alleviate the financial burden on patients [\\[9\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0045). In about half of African countries, over 40 % of total health expenditure comes from household out-of-pocket payments [\\[10\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0050). This outbreak will likely strain these payments further, as more out-of-pocket spending will be required for mpox-related hospital admissions and treatments. To control the spread of mpox, investment in vaccination, treatment, and preventive measures is essential. However, the approved vaccine is prohibitively expensive. While vaccines for many infectious diseases typically cost between $1 and $3 per dose in mass vaccination programs, the Africa Centres for Disease Control has set the price for Bavarian's mpox vaccine at $100 per dose, and the WHO has quoted it at $141 per dose [\\[11\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0055). This price is beyond what most African countries can afford and exceeds per capita health spending, especially considering ongoing health challenges such as cholera, measles, malaria, and HIV.\n\nHospitalization is also inevitable during disease outbreaks. The global case hospitalization rate for mpox following the 2022 outbreak was estimated at 14.1 %, with high variability across regions. By the outbreak period, hospitalization rates were 49.8 % before 2017, 21.7 % from 2017 to 2021, and 5.8 % during the 2022 outbreak, again with considerable variability [\\[12\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0060). Rising hospitalization rates will further strain already overcrowded hospitals, placing added pressure on health system infrastructure and finances. The increase in mpox-related hospitalizations adds significant financial demands, requiring more spending on inpatient care, infrastructure, workforce capacity, and preventive measures. This redirection of resources risks diverting funds from other health priorities and increasing costs for both public and private healthcare financing sources.\n\nAfrica's healthcare system, already strained by a high disease burden and limited resources, now faces an additional challenge with the rise of mpox. The continent suffers from a severe shortage of hospital beds, with many countries having fewer than 10 beds per 10,000 people [\\[13\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0065). This limited capacity will be further stretched as mpox cases increase, necessitating the expansion of healthcare facilities to meet the growing demand. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need to address hospital bed shortages, particularly in Western Africa, where 8 out of 11 countries have critically low bed numbers [\\[13\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0065). With a limited health workforce and insufficient resources, Africa's healthcare system is ill-equipped to manage the added burden of mpox, highlighting the urgent need to increase bed availability and strengthen healthcare infrastructure.\n\n## 5\\. Way Forward and Conclusion\n\nThe re-emergence of mpox in Africa presents costs that may be overwhelming for individuals and households, increasing the risk of impoverishment and making the outbreak harder to control. With inflation at record highs in many African countries [\\[14\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0070) and rising reliance on out-of-pocket spending for mpox prevention and treatment, many households may face intensified financial strain. To address this, each African country must review its national health policy to build a sustainable and resilient financing structure that supports all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable, during health emergencies. The primary purpose of health financing policy is to shield people from severe economic impacts, especially in times of disease outbreaks [\\[5\\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11638650/#b0025). African leaders should prioritize accountability by reducing dependency on donor funds to manage health emergencies. Instead, they should proactively develop and support alternative health financing mechanisms that do not place undue burden on individuals or households. A further step to demonstrate commitment is ensuring that at least 15 % of national budgets are allocated to health financing, as established in the 2001 Abuja Declaration.\n\n**Ethical Approval**\n\nNot applicable\n\n**Authors’ Contributions**\n\nT.O conceptualized the study and wrote the main manuscript.\n\nT.O and E.O worked on the revised manuscript.\n\n**Funding**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Taiwo Oluwaseun Sokunbi:** Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Conceptualization, Visualization. **Elijah Orimisan Akinbi:** Writing – review & editing.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## References\n\n- 1.Pan American Health Organization.

Changes to these practices must consider social, economic, and environmental factors, making a collaborative One Health approach essential. We propose a pilot intervention as a way forward.\n\n## Background\n\nAlarmingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared mpox (formerly monkeypox) a public health emergency of international concern in August 2024 \\[ [1](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR1 \"WHO.

Accessed 12 Sept 2024. \")\\]. This decision was prompted by a surge in cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other parts of Africa, the potential for further spread within and beyond the continent, and the emergence of a new strain of the virus. WHO had previously declared mpox an emergency in July 2022, remaining until May 2023 when the situation had been considered under control.\n\nThe strategies recommended by WHO and other major institutions call for immediate financial contributions—up to 4 billion USD—to support pandemic prevention and control efforts, which include, among others, surveillance, risk communication, and immunization \\[ [2](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR2 \"WHO.

While these measures—which can be viewed as downstream activities—are vital for preventing human-to-human transmission of mpox, it is equally important to address upstream activities.\n\nPreventing outbreaks is typically more cost-effective than managing them. Therefore, attention must be given to the root causes of disease emergence, particularly where mpox is transmitted from animals to humans. Human interaction with bushmeat—any tissue from wild animals used as food—is a major factor in the spread of mpox in regions where animals carry the virus. A One Health approach offers a promising, cost-effective framework, promoting collaboration across sectors to address the connections between humans, bushmeat, and the environment \\[ [2](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR2 \"WHO. Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox 2024–2027. Geneva: WHO; 2024. \")\\].\n\nOver the last 10 years (2014–2024), there have been 16 mpox spillover events linked to bushmeat, which is more than in previous decades (see Additional file 1 for an overview). Most of these cases occurred in Africa, except for four cases involving travelers from Nigeria to the UK ( _n_ = 2), Singapore ( _n_ = 1), and Israel ( _n_ = 1). Where gender and age data were available, children made up the majority of those affected (48%), followed by men (34%) and women (18%). Rats were the most reported type of bushmeat involved, followed by squirrels and monkeys. Most spillover events did not result in large-scale outbreaks, and both handling and consumption were commonly linked to these cases.\n\n### Applying lessons from food safety efforts in informal markets\n\nReducing risky interactions with bushmeat could help prevent mpox and other foodborne diseases early on. Bushmeat is often sold alongside other fresh foods in informal or “wet” markets, meaning traditional, non-modern food sale points. Since these markets and bushmeat activities typically operate with minimal regulation and inconsistent hygiene, applying advances in practices and policies from food safety research in informal markets could help mitigate the risks posed by bushmeat.\n\nBased on two decades of research by the CGIAR—a global research partnership dedicated to transforming food, land, and water systems in a climate crisis—and partners in these hard-to-reach markets \\[ [4](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR4 \"Grace D.

This approach posits that food safety can be improved if, and only if, three areas are addressed: \\[ [1](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR1 \"WHO.

Nairobi: African Public Health Foundation (APHF); 2024. \")\\] improving policies and regulations. Each component is essential for adopting safer practices. We expand below on how this approach could apply to bushmeat.\n\n### Capacity-building\n\nFood safety efforts in informal markets have traditionally focused on training local communities to encourage the adoption of safer practices. To design effective programs, frameworks like adult learning theory, social behavior change communication, and behavioral economics can provide valuable guidance but are little used \\[ [5](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR5 \"Saylors KE, Mouiche MM, Lucas A, McIver DJ, Matsida A, Clary C, et al. Market characteristics and zoonotic disease risk perception in Cameroon bushmeat markets. Soc Sci Med. 2021;268: 113358.\")\\].\n\nImportantly, understanding how people perceive disease risk and what influences these perceptions is key to creating effective strategies. In communities where people already recognize the risks associated with bushmeat, health messages could focus on practical, protective steps. In places where skepticism exists, sharing evidence of health risks may be more successful. Since exposure to mpox can vary based on factors like gender, occupation, and other social identifiers, prevention strategies should be tailored accordingly \\[ [6](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR6 \"Guagliardo SAJ, Doshi RH, Reynolds MG, Dzabatou-Babeaux A, Ndakala N, Moses C, et al. Do monkeypox exposures vary by ethnicity? Comparison of aka and Bantu suspected monkeypox cases. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2020;102(1):202–5.\")\\].\n\nHealth messages need to be tailored to the local context. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, there was distrust of formal institutions and a rejection of government health messages linking Ebola to bushmeat \\[ [7](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR7 \"Lucas A, Kumakamba C, Saylors K, Obel E, Kamenga R, Makuwa M, et al. Risk perceptions and behaviors of actors in the wild animal value chain in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. PLoS ONE. 2022;17(2): e0261601.\")\\]. This suggests that risk reduction strategies from these sources may face challenges in gaining acceptance. Reaching at-risk populations may be more effective through a mix of formal and informal channels and working with trusted community leaders and healthcare staff.\n\nMessages should also consider the significance of bushmeat to those involved \\[ [8](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR8 \"Duda R, Betoulet JM, Besombes C, Mbrenga F, Borzykh Y, Nakouné E, et al. A time of decline: an eco-anthropological and ethnohistorical investigation of mpox in the Central African Republic. PLOS Glob Public Heal. 2024;4(3):1–22.\")\\]. Instead of pushing an anti-hunting agenda, a more helpful approach could involve providing ways to reduce the risk of disease transmission without completely discouraging hunting and consumption. While this approach may not eliminate all risks, it is likely to be more effective than a campaign that fails to resonate with the community.\n\nIn some settings, even when people are aware of the risks and know how to protect themselves, they may not adopt safer practices. While having the right knowledge is important for encouraging change, there also need to be incentives for people to act on what they know.\n\n### Motivation and incentives\n\nIn low-resource settings, governments have frequently relied on bans and enforcement measures, including fines and inspections, as “incentives” for change. For example, the Nigerian government banned the sale of bushmeat as a precaution to stop the spread of mpox in June 2022. However, these approaches can have unintended consequences, such as driving bushmeat practices underground and worsening hygiene conditions \\[ [9](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR9 \"Milbank C, Vira B. Wildmeat consumption and zoonotic spillover: contextualising disease emergence and policy responses. Lancet Planet Health. 2022;6(5):e439–48.\")\\].\n\nA potentially more effective incentive is to focus on economic, social, or moral gains. Economic incentives, for example, might include describing the potential financial gains from attracting a larger customer base due to the credibility of the safer product. Social incentives could involve earning the trust and positive reputation of community members. Moral incentives could stem from the pride in ensuring that bushmeat is handled and sold in a way that reduces health risks. Involving key stakeholders—such as communities, government institutions, and national research centers—in the process helps ensure that risk prevention measures are locally validated and practical.\n\nAlthough food safety is a large concern for consumers worldwide, it often takes a back seat to affordability among budget-constrained individuals. For these consumers, food safety is not a priority compared to cost. To ensure the sustainability and long-term effectiveness of food safety interventions, support from authorities is essential. Governments need to increase consumer awareness about food safety issues and make the choice of safer food options more accessible.\n\n### Enabling policies and regulations\n\nLocal and national authorities can foster a supportive environment by investing in essential infrastructure, capacity building, monitoring, and surveillance activities. In some low-resource settings, food safety laws are either nonexistent or not applicable to informal contexts. Implementing tailored policies and regulations for bushmeat, particularly for high-risk settings, can improve hygiene efforts. Establishing recognition programs for businesses that achieve notable improvements in food safety can inspire others to follow their lead. Additionally, promoting alternative protein sources by providing access to affordable, nutritious food options and supporting sustainable agricultural practices can help to reduce bushmeat reliance.\n\n### The role of One Health\n\nBushmeat is a key resource for many rural communities. In Africa, the annual harvest, estimated between 1 and 5 million metric tonnes, is substantial compared to the continent’s livestock production of about 14 million metric tonnes per year \\[ [10](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR10 \" Grace D, Bett B, Cook E, Lam S, MacMillan S, Masudi P, et al. Eating wild animals: Rewards, risks, and recommendations. ILRI, Nairobi; 2024. \")\\]. Climate change may further increase reliance on bushmeat as a food source. Any proposed changes to bushmeat practices must consider these social, economic, and environmental factors. The One Health approach promotes collaboration among public health authorities, veterinarians, wildlife experts, environmental scientists, and community leaders, enabling balanced measures to reduce transmission at the animal-human-environmental interface \\[ [2](https://bmcglobalpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44263-024-00100-2#ref-CR2 \"WHO. Strategic framework for enhancing prevention and control of mpox 2024–2027. Geneva: WHO; 2024. \")\\].\n\nAs countries plan their responses to mpox, three key considerations should be kept in mind. First, it is important to recognize that bushmeat is a crucial part of many communities' lives and contributes to their health and well-being. Second, responses should be developed with input from local communities to minimize any impacts of voluntary behavior changes, which will increase the chances of successful adoption; the One Health approach can help with this by bringing different actors together. Lastly, high-income countries should lead by not only sharing knowledge but also boosting funding for global health initiatives, as this investment can substantially reduce the risk of future outbreaks.\n\n### A proposed pilot intervention\n\nWe propose a pilot project using the “three-legged stool” approach and leveraging One Health collaboration. First, identify a high-risk area for spillover and one amenable to interventions through epidemiological risk-targeting and socio-cultural characterization. Next, develop a proof-of-concept that includes (a) intensive sensitization and training for communities and local authorities; (b) providing subsidies to high bushmeat users for purchasing livestock or other alternative products, with subsidies linked to measurable improvements in biodiversity and reductions in hunting; and (c) engaging national decision-makers to secure buy-in. If successful, we suggest further refinement to maximize benefits, minimize costs, and extend the approach.\n\n## Data availability\n\nNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nWHO:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n## References\n\n01.

Health policymakers often have several interventions to consider based on the health of the population, as well as the cascading social and economic consequences of the possible mitigation strategies. The current outbreak of the monkeypox virus has elicited debate on the best mitigation strategy, especially given that most world economies are still recovering from the harsh economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper sought to analyze the costs and benefits of three possible strategies and determine which option has the best health outcomes and positive economic effects. A case study of Jeddah was performed, whereby a model was simulated to determine the number of infections over 28 days based on one case of the monkeypox virus. Findings reveal that the vaccination provides the best intervention, as it effectively reduces the transmission rate and prevents loss of lives in the city. From the model, only three people were infected over the research period, while no deaths were reported. Although vaccination incurs a huge direct cost at the beginning, in the long run, it saves the economy from the disease’s financial burden in terms of productivity loss from work absenteeism and premature deaths.\n\n[![Simulated transmission rate when no intervention is implemented.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364662676/figure/tbl1/AS:11431281091745215@1666615719396/Simulated-transmission-rate-when-no-intervention-is-implemented_Q320.jpg)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Simulated-transmission-rate-when-no-intervention-is-implemented_tbl1_364662676 \"Simulated transmission rate when no intervention is implemented.\")\n\n[Simulated transmission rate when no intervention is implemented.\\\\\n\\\\\n…](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Simulated-transmission-rate-when-no-intervention-is-implemented_tbl1_364662676)\n\n[![Transmission rate after quarantine.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364662676/figure/tbl2/AS:11431281091754712@1666615719431/Transmission-rate-after-quarantine_Q320.jpg)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Transmission-rate-after-quarantine_tbl2_364662676 \"Transmission rate after quarantine.\")\n\n[Transmission rate after quarantine.\\\\\n\\\\\n…](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Transmission-rate-after-quarantine_tbl2_364662676)\n\n[![Transmission rate after vaccination.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364662676/figure/tbl3/AS:11431281091764256@1666615719460/Transmission-rate-after-vaccination_Q320.jpg)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Transmission-rate-after-vaccination_tbl3_364662676 \"Transmission rate after vaccination.\")\n\n[Transmission rate after vaccination.\\\\\n\\\\\n…](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Transmission-rate-after-vaccination_tbl3_364662676)\n\n[![Comparison of the interventions.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364662676/figure/tbl4/AS:11431281091734975@1666615719498/Comparison-of-the-interventions_Q320.jpg)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-the-interventions_tbl4_364662676 \"Comparison of the interventions.\")\n\n[Comparison of the interventions.\\\\\n\\\\\n…](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-the-interventions_tbl4_364662676)\n\nFigures - available via license: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\nContent may be subject to copyright.\n\n![ResearchGate Logo](https://www.researchgate.net/images/icons/svgicons/researchgate-logo-white.svg)\n\n**Discover the world's research**\n\n- 25+ million members\n- 160+ million publication pages\n- 2.3+ billion citations\n\n[Join for free](https://www.researchgate.net/signup.SignUp.html)\n\nAvailable via license: [CC BY 4.0](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby%2F4.0%2F)\n\nContent may be subject to copyright.\n\nInt.

Introduction\n\nOn May 18, 2022, a U.S. resident tested positive for monkeypox after returning to the\n\nU.S. from Canada \\[1\\]. As of June 18, 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n(CDC) reported 113 confirmed cases of monkeypox across multiple states. Days later,\n\nmultiple monkeypox cases were reported in different countries that are not normally en-\n\ndemic to the virus. As of June 22, 2022, more than 40 countries that are not endemic to the\n\nmonkeypox virus have reported viral disease outbreaks, as confirmed cases exceed 3,000\n\n\\[2\\]. What makes the current outbreak more concerning is the rapid, continuing spread\n\ninto new nations and continents, and the risk of further sustained transmission into vul-\n\nnerable populations, including people that are immunocompro-mised, pregnant women,\n\nand children.\n\nMonkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It was\n\nfirst documented in humans in the 1970s, and outbreaks have been reported in many\n\ncountries, with most cases restricted to endemic areas \\[3\\]. Symptoms of an infected person\n\ninclude rashes, fever, headaches, muscle ache, swelling, and back pain as re-ported by the\n\nWHO \\[4\\]. Usually, the infections last two to four weeks. The monkeypox virus is typically\n\nendemic to Central and West African countries such as the Demo-cratic Republic of the\n\nCongo (which has the highest infection rate), Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote\n\nd'Ivoire, Liberia, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone \\[3\\]. Although\n\nepidemiological investigations are still ongoing, reported cases thus far have not estab-\n\nlished travel links to endemic areas. Consequently, the unusually high number of people\n\ninfected with monkeypox outside of Africa with no travel links to the region has created\n\nCitation: Alshararni, A.M.\n\nCost–Benefit Analysis of\n\nInterventions to Mitigate the\n\nMonkeypox Virus.

J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 2 of 12\n\na sense of panic that the virus is now spreading globally. Cessation of smallpox vaccina-\n\ntion programs, encroachment of humans into forested areas, and growing international\n\nmobility are suspected to be the main reason contributing to the current outbreak. So far,\n\n72 deaths have been reported in eight countries \\[5\\]. However, these deaths all occurred in\n\nAfrica, and non-endemic nations are yet to record fatalities from the virus.\n\nTransmission of the monkeypox virus occurs through three main channels. First, an\n\ninfection can occur after close contact with the skin lesions of an infected person \\[6\\]. Sec-\n\nondly, monkeypox spreads after a person/animal is exposed to large respiratory droplets\n\nof the infected person/animal during face-to-face contact, or exposure to oral fluids of an\n\ninfected individual during intimate sexual contact \\[7\\]. Finally, as with the case of the in-\n\nfected UK health worker \\[8\\], the monkeypox virus can also be transmitted through con-\n\ntaminated fomites.\n\nWhile monkeypox and Covid-19 both spread through respiratory droplets during\n\nclose face-to-face interaction, the latter is extremely infectious and only requires tiny drop-\n\nlets to spread. Despite being transmitted through respiratory secretions, monkey-pox is\n\nnot a respiratory virus \\[9\\]. Instead, it predominantly spreads through direct (usually pro-\n\nlonged) contact with monkeypox rash, scabs, or body fluids from someone infected.\n\nMany respiratory infectious diseases are transmitted through close per-son-to-person\n\ncontacts. In their study, Leung et al. determined that the number of re-ported contacts and\n\nduration of interaction were influenced by age (inversely), house-hold size (direct), edu-\n\ncation (direct), and income level (direct). In their study, Leung et al. concluded that a per-\n\nson interacts with a mean of 8 contacts per day \\[10\\]. Indeed, this figure is ideal for the\n\nstudy given that the serological survey was conducted in Hong Kong, a hotspot for emerg-\n\ning infectious diseases due to its immense population density and high connectivity in the\n\nworldwide air-transportation network. During the duration of the study (2015), Hong\n\nKong's population was estimated to be 7.291 mil-lion. Moreover, Leung et al. considered\n\nrespiratory viruses such as pertussis that can also be spread through face-to-face interac-\n\ntions or droplets deposited on contaminated surfaces \\[10\\]. In another study, Eams et al.\n\ninvestigated dynamic social contact pat-terns as a measure to explain the spread of the\n\nHIN1 virus. Like Leung et al., their findings showed that physical social contact patterns\n\nvary across age groups in an inverse version, with adults aged 65 years and above show-\n\ning an average of 3 persons per day, those in the 19-64 years of age having an average of\n\n5 physical contacts per day, and children of the school going age (5-18 years) having an\n\naverage of 11 contacts per day \\[11\\]. Similarly, Dodd et al. age- and sex-specific social con-\n\ntact patterns and incidence of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The findings of their\n\nstudy showed that on average, adults in high density environments make about 10 social\n\ncontacts on a single day \\[12\\]. Further, Johnstone-Robertson et al. designed a study to in-\n\nvestigate social mixing patterns within a South African township community and the im-\n\nplications they have for respiratory diseasetransmission and control. The authors found\n\nthat on average, adults make an average of 12 contact per day \\[13\\]. For this study, contact\n\nwill comprise physical interaction between people, close and prolonged face-to-face con-\n\ntact, sexual contact, touching fabrics, objects, and surfaces that have been used by some-\n\none.\n\nDuring past years, viral outbreaks caused devastating direct and indirect effects on\n\nthe affected communities. The 1918 influenza pandemic is the most severe in mod-ern\n\nhistory \\[14\\]. Approximately 500 million people, constituting one-third of the world’s pop-\n\nulation at the time, were infected by the H1N1 virus \\[15\\]. Consequently, at least 50 million\n\npeople worldwide died from the virus, with about 675,000 occurring in the United States\n\n\\[16\\]. What was especially concerning regarding this pandemic was the high mortality in\n\nhealthy people, including those aged between 20-40 years \\[17\\]. The pandemic occurred in\n\nthree waves, with the second and third waves claiming the most lives. India is believed to\n\nhave suffered at least 12.5 million deaths during the pandemic \\[15\\].\n\nFurther, beyond the high death toll, the full impact of the 1918–1919 pandemic was\n\nrealized about 60 years later. A study examining epidemiological data on individuals born\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 3 of 12\n\nin 1919, who were newborns or second- or third-trimester fetuses during the height of the\n\npandemic, revealed that these individuals had approximately 25% more heart disease af-\n\nter age 60 \\[18\\]. Besides, this population exhibited an increased risk of diabetes in compar-\n\nison with a similar population from a different era, including those who were older infants\n\nduring the pandemic.\n\nConsidering that influenza was particularly deadly for young adults without pre-\n\nexisting conditions, its economic impact was severe in comparison with other out-breaks\n\nthat mostly affect young and aged citizens \\[19\\]. The sharp fall in economic activity cou-\n\npled with heightened inflation resulted in massive declines in the real returns on stocks\n\nand short-term government bonds \\[20\\]. For instance, economies experiencing an average\n\ndeath rate of 2 percent saw real stock returns drop by 26 percentage points \\[21,22\\]. Garrett\n\nused historical newspaper reports to gauge the effects of the pandemic on US businesses.\n\nIn the short term, businesses such as grocery stores and merchants/department stores re-\n\nport severe falls in consumer demand and labor shortages \\[23\\]. Barro, Ursúa, and Weng\n\nfound that the Spanish flu reduced real GDP per capita by around 6 percent in the typical\n\ncountry over the period 1918–21 \\[24\\]. Correia, Luck, and Verner found that Spanish flu\n\nreduced US manufacturing output by 18 percent \\[25\\].\n\nCorreia, Luck, and Verner also emphasize the important link between government\n\ncontainment measures and economic outcomes \\[25\\]. Theoretically, the economic effects of\n\ncontainment measures could be positive or negative. While reviewing the im-pact of\n\nCovid-19 containment measures, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concludes that\n\ncontainment measures have a significant impact on economic activity, equivalent to a loss\n\nof about 15 percent in industrial production over 30 days following their implementation\n\n\\[26\\]. Workplace absenteeism and reduction in productivity slow down across various in-\n\ndustries \\[27\\]. Social distancing, self-isolation, and travel re-strictions during the peak of\n\nthe Covid-19 pandemic caused reduced workforce and job losses across all economic sec-\n\ntors. However, such containment measures prevent the long-term loss of income caused\n\nby premature deaths \\[28\\]. After studying the spread and impact of the Severe Acute Res-\n\npiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Toronto, Gupta, Moyer, and Stern explain that\n\nquarantine is effective in containing newly emerging infectious diseases, while cost-sav-\n\ning when compared to not implementing a widespread containment mechanism \\[29,30\\].\n\nThe SARS epidemic in Toronto resulted in relatively few infections and deaths. Had the\n\nvirus not been contained, the re-search's simulation model indicated that it could have\n\nspread throughout Canada as well as the rest of the world with devastating economic\n\neffects.\n\nAlthough the risk to the general public remains low \\[3\\], close contact should be\n\navoided with those suspected of the infection. These include those with skin or genital\n\nlesions, as well as sick or dead animals. CDC also urges those displaying symptoms of the\n\nvirus, such as an unexplained skin rash or lesions, to avoid contact with others and reach\n\nout to their healthcare provider for guidance. Moreover, the WHO recommends promptly\n\nisolating suspected or confirmed cases in a single room with adequate ventilation, a ded-\n\nicated bathroom, and staff until all lesions have resolved, the scabs have fallen off, and a\n\nfresh layer of intact skin has formed. One isolation strategy that has proved effective is\n\nquarantine, where a person suspected or found to have a disease is separated from others\n\nto prevent the spread of the virus. As Wang et al. explain, quarantine strategies effectively\n\nreduce the infection rate and delay new infections over time \\[6\\]. Consequently, countries\n\nsuch as Belgium, the U.K., and Germany have already introduced mandatory 21-day\n\nquarantine for patients confirmed to have been infected by the monkeypox virus \\[7,31\\].\n\nHowever, critics such as Joe Biden, the U.S President, claim that quarantines are not fea-\n\nsible to address the ongoing monk pox pandemic.\n\nVaccination against smallpox has proved to be cross-protective against monkey-pox.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the smallpox vaccine is 85% effective in preventing monkeypox\n\n\\[5\\]. However, any immunity from smallpox vaccination is currently limited only to older\n\ncitizens (minimum age varies among countries 42-50) since smallpox vaccination\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 4 of 12\n\nprograms were stopped after the eradication of smallpox \\[32\\]. In addition, protection for\n\nthose vaccinated may have waned over time. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-\n\ntion (FDA) recently approved a live-attenuated vaccine, trademarked as JYNNEOS, that\n\nprotects against infection of smallpox and monkeypox in adults 18 years of age or older\n\n\\[8\\].\n\nEconomic evaluation of health and health care has become an increasingly common\n\ncomponent in health policy and planning. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) formally as-\n\nsesses trade-offs involving benefits, harms, and costs inherent in alternative options. Such\n\nanalysis explicitly quantifies the relative costs and benefits of alternative interventions\n\n\\[33\\]. Hence, this illuminates the potential trade-offs and informs discussions of whether a\n\nparticular intervention (over an alternative) is worth its additional health gain. Cost-effec-\n\ntiveness analysis (CEA) has been used as a tool for addressing issues of efficiency in the\n\nallocation of scarce health resources, providing as it does a method for comparing the\n\nrelative costs as well as health gains of different (and often competing) health interven-\n\ntions \\[9\\]. Net cost is calculated by subtracting the averted medical and productivity costs\n\nfrom the expenses of the intervention. This study will examine the costs and health out-\n\ncomes of implementing quarantines and vaccinations to curb the new spread of the mon-\n\nkeypox virus \\[34\\].\n\n2\\. Research Method\n\n2.1. Research Objective\n\nThis study seeks to compare the costs and health outcomes of implementing quaran-\n\ntines or vaccinating people to mitigate the spread of the monkeypox virus.\n\n2.2. Research Questions\n\n1\\. What is the cost of not adopting any intervention to curb the spread of the mon-\n\nkeypox?\n\n2\\. What is the net cost incurred when quarantining patients with the monkeypox vi-\n\nrus?\n\n3\\. What is the net cost incurred to vaccinate patients with the monkeypox virus?\n\n2.3. Research Methodology\n\nThis research will use a case study of Jeddah, a Saudi Arabian port city on the Red\n\nSea. The study will be simulated to run in 28 days and will target the city’s entire popula-\n\ntion of 4.8 million people. The research will assume that one person, patient zero, contracts\n\nthe virus and spreads it to the rest of the city. First, a model will be used to simulate the\n\nspread and effects of the monkeypox virus when an intervention is not used. Subse-\n\nquently, the economic implications of the viral infection will be calculated over the study’s\n\nperiod. This will aggregate the medical costs of treating those infected and the productiv-\n\nity loss from both work absenteeism and mortality. Afterward, a quarantine facility will\n\nbe introduced to isolate those infected by the virus. The costs of the quarantine and the\n\nmedical expenses will be compared to the economic benefits of this intervention. Finally,\n\nthe community will be vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine, which has proved to be 85%\n\neffective in preventing monkeypox. The cost of the vaccination will then be compared to\n\nthe financial gain of this intervention.\n\n3\\. Results\n\n3.1. The Cost of Not Implementing Any Intervention\n\nThe government has an option to not implement any intervention and instead allow\n\nthe virus to spread freely among the population. Hence, a model will be used to simulate\n\nthe infection rate in the city and determine how many people will have contracted the\n\nvirus within 28 days. In addition, the monkeypox infection rate will be used to determine\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 5 of 12\n\nhow many of the infected people will die from the disease and the economic burden of\n\ntheir deaths on the community.\n\nThe transmission rate of a virus is influenced by various factors, the most important\n\nbeing the rate of contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Using informed\n\nestimates and data about the transmission rate of the monkeypox virus, Jeddah’s popula-\n\ntion density, the number of contacts a typical person makes in one day, and the incubation\n\nperiod of the monkeypox virus, the spread of the virus throughout the population will be\n\nmodeled. This study will use findings by Jezek et al., who sought to determine the prob-\n\nability of becoming ill following infection from a known human source \\[10\\]. From the 2278\n\npeople who had close contact with 245 monkeypox patients infected from an animal\n\nsource, 93 fell ill and were presumed to have been infected from the known human source,\n\nalbeit from different generations. Hence, there was an overall 3% probability of becoming\n\nill following infection from a known human source.\n\nThe number of contacts a typical person comes in close contact with on any given\n\nday varies across individuals and locations. In a study to determine the spread of respir-\n\natory infections across a population, Leung et al., concluded that people interact with an\n\naverage of eight contacts per day \\[11\\]. Hence, on the first day, patient zero will transmit\n\nthe virus to 3% of the people they interact with. Therefore, the number of infections on the\n\nfirst day will be calculated as:\n\nNumber of new infections (nni) = transmission rate (tr) × number of contacts per\n\nday (cpd), (1)\n\nNumber of new infections on the first day (nni) = 3% × 8 = 0.24, (2)\n\nNumber of total infections (nti) = previous infections (pi) + transmission\n\nrate (tr) × number of total contacts per day (cpd), (3)\n\nnti for the first day = pi + (tr × (cpd × nni)), (4)\n\nnti = 1 + (0.03 × (8 × 1)) = 1.24, (5)\n\nNumber of total infections on the 2nd day (nti) = 1.24 + (0.03 × 8 × 1.24) =\n\n1.5376 (6)\n\nBelow is a summary of the infections during the 28-day window.\n\nAs such, by the end of the 28th day, 413 people would have contracted the virus.\n\nSince no intervention will be taken, there are no direct expenses incurred.\n\n3.1.1. Cost of Mortality\n\nResearchers have observed that the monkeypox virus in non-endemic regions is less\n\nlethal than the strain observed in West Africa. Indeed, this is accurate since all 72 deaths\n\nso far have been reported from eight countries in Africa, and no non-endemic country has\n\nrecorded fatalities from the virus \\[5\\] However, researchers still assign a case fatality ratio\n\n(CFR) of 1% for non-endemic countries \\[5\\]. Hence, 1% of the 413 people will succumb to\n\nthe disease.\n\n0.01 × 413 = 4 deaths within 28 days;\n\nIn 2021, the GDP per capita in Saudi Arabia was USD 23,310. Therefore, the monthly\n\nwage of workers in RSA = USD 23,310/12 (months) working days;\n\nThe monthly wage of workers in RSA = USD 1942.5;\n\nThe daily wage of workers = USD 1942.5/21 (average number of working days in a\n\nmonth) = USD 92.5 \\[33,35\\].\n\nThe median age in Saudi Arabia is 31.8 years, while the life expectancy is 75.13 years\n\n\\[12\\]. Nonetheless, the official retirement age is 60 years.\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 6 of 12\n\nHence, 28.2 years of productivity will be lost due to death. This amounts to 28.2 ×\n\nUSD 23,310 (GDP per capita) × 4 = USD 2,629,368 lost from the economy.\n\n3.1.2. Cost of Work Absenteeism\n\nMost monkeypox patients heal and recover in 2 to 4 weeks. Hence, the 413 people\n\nwill be in isolation for 28 days. The productivity loss incurred is calculated as:\n\nThe daily wage of workers × isolation days × number of patients;\n\nUSD 92.5 × 28 × 413 = USD 1,069,670;\n\nTotal loss to the economy from not taking any intervention = cost of mortality + cost\n\nof work absenteeism = USD 2,629,368 + USD 1,069,670 = USD 3,699,033.\n\n3.2. The Net Cost of Quarantine\n\nQuarantine effectively reduces the infection rate and delays new infections over time.\n\nIn his research to determine the impact of quarantine on COVID-19 on infections, Marshall\n\nconcludes that the average reduction in the infection rate is 24.9% \\[13\\]. Hence, the infec-\n\ntion rate will reduce by 0.747%. Hence, the new infection rate will be:\n\n3% − 0.747% = 2.253%\n\nThe number of infections for the 28 days based on the new infection rate will be sim-\n\nulated as:\n\n3.3. Direct Costs\n\nThe direct cost of quarantine comprises the accommodation and treatment expenses\n\n\\[34\\]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Airlines announced quarantine packages for\n\nvarious hotels in Riyadh, Jeddah, Medina, and Dammam. The quarantine facility in Ri-\n\nyadh is available at (USD 779) 2920 Saudi Riyals (SAR) for three-star hotels, (USD 1323)\n\nSAR 4965 for four-star, (USD 1833) SAR 6880 for five-star (Hilton Hotel), and SAR (USD\n\n2063) 7744 for five-star (Lemeridian Hotel) (Syed, 2021). It is important to note that these\n\ncosts cover the entire quarantine period. Thus, the average of the airlines’ quarantine\n\npackages is:\n\n(USD 779 + USD 1323 + USD 1833 + USD 2063)/4;\n\nAverage cost of quarantine per room = USD 1500;\n\nCost of 104 rooms for 14 days of quarantine = USD 1500 × 104 = $156,000.\n\nThere are no treatments specifically for monkeypox virus infections \\[3\\]. For the ma-\n\njority of the patients, the signs and symptoms of monkeypox will resolve on their own,\n\nwithout any treatment. Plenty of fluids, good nutrition, and rest help the patients recover\n\nwithout medication. However, the risk of serious illness may be greater in pregnant\n\nwomen, children, and those with weaker immune systems. Monkeypox and smallpox vi-\n\nruses are genetically similar, which means that antiviral drugs and vaccines developed to\n\nprotect against smallpox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections\n\n\\[3\\]. Antivirals, such as tecovirimat (TPOXX), may be recommended for people who are\n\nmore likely to get severely ill, such as patients with weakened immune systems. For small-\n\npox, the Mayo Clinic recommends that adults should take 600 milligrams (mg) (3 cap-\n\nsules) twice a day for 14 days. On average, a dose of TPOXX costs USD 50 (SAR 188).\n\nAssuming that all the 5 patients will need medication, the treatment cost will be:\n\nCost of TPOXX = 104 ×USD 50 = USD 5200;\n\nTotal direct costs = cost of accommodation \\+ cost of medication = USD 156,000 + 5200\n\n= USD 161,200.\n\n3.4. Indirect Costs\n\n3.4.1. Cost of Mortality\n\nGiven that 1% of the 104 people will succumb to the disease,\n\n0.01 × 104 = 1 death within 28 days.\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 7 of 12\n\nHence, 28.2 years of productivity will be lost due to death. This amounts to 28.2 ×\n\nUSD 23,310 (GDP per capita) = USD 657,342 lost from the economy.\n\n3.4.2. Cost of Work Absenteeism\n\nThe productivity loss incurred is calculated as:\n\nThe daily wage of workers × isolation days × number of patients;\n\nUSD 92.5 × 28 × 104 = USD 269,360;\n\nTotal loss to the economy from not taking any intervention = cost of mortality + cost\n\nof work absenteeism = USD 657,342 + USD 269,360 = 926,702;\n\nThe Total Cost of Quarantine = USD 161,200 (direct costs) + USD 926,702 (indirect\n\ncosts) = USD 1,087,902.\n\n3.5. The Net Cost of Vaccination\n\n3.5.1. Direct Costs\n\nThe direct cost of vaccination comprises the cost of purchasing the vaccine, as well as\n\nthe budget to cater for the logistics involved in vaccinating the 4.8 million people. As part\n\nof the voluntary vaccination program, the government will announce that mandatory\n\nsmallpox vaccinations would be available for free. However, CDC estimates that smallpox\n\nscreening and vaccination efforts would cost the government USD 5 to USD 10 per patient\n\n\\[14\\]. Hence, this study will use USD 7.5 as the average cost of vaccinating each citizen.\n\nTherefore, assuming that the government vaccinates 100% of the population, the direct\n\ncost of this intervention will be:\n\nUSD 7.5 × 4.8 = USD 36 million.\n\n3.5.2. Indirect Costs\n\nThe smallpox vaccine has been shown to offer 85 percent of protection against mon-\n\nkeypox \\[3\\]. Hence, the infection rate will reduce by 0.0255, making the new infection rate\n\n0.45%. The number of infections for the 28 days based on the new infection rate will be\n\nsimulated as:\n\nCost of Mortality\n\nGiven that 1% of the 3 people will succumb to the disease,\n\n0.01 × 3 = 0 deaths within 28 days.\n\nCost of Work Absenteeism\n\nThe productivity loss incurred is calculated as:\n\nThe daily wage of workers × isolation days × number of patients;\n\nUSD 92.5 × 28 × 3 = USD 7770;\n\nTotal loss to the economy from not taking any intervention = cost of mortality + cost\n\nof work absenteeism = USD 7770.\n\nThe Total Cost of Quarantine = USD 36,000,000 (direct costs) + USD 7770 (indirect\n\ncosts) = USD 36,007,770.\n\n4\\. Discussion\n\nThe health ministries can opt to implement either of the three strategies to curb the\n\nspread of the monkeypox virus. Each of these choices has different costs and benefits, as\n\nillustrated below.\n\nTables 1-4 provide summary details of the simulation and the cost implications. Spe-\n\ncifically, Table 1 is the simulated transmission rate assuming no government intervention\n\nmeasure is put in place, Table 2 presents a summary of the simulated transmission rate\n\nafter the quarantine, while Tables 3 and 4 summarize the transmission rate after vaccina-\n\ntion and a comparison of the interventions respectively. As shown in Table 4, no expendi-\n\nture would be incurred from not taking any measures to prevent the spread of the mon-\n\nkeypox virus. However, 413 people would contract the virus within 28 days, causing 4\n\ndeaths. In the long run, the isolation and deaths would adversely affect the nation’s GDP\n\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health2022, 19, 13789 8 of 12\n\nat USD 3,699,033. On the other hand, the direct costs of quarantine would be USD 161,200.\n\nQuarantine would help reduce the transmission rate of the virus, effectively minimizing\n\nthe infections to only 5 within 28 days and a single death. The isolation of infected people\n\nand the mortality cost of the single life would amount to USD 926,702. Hence, the total\n\ncost of this intention would be 1,087,902. Finally, the government would spend USD 36\n\nmillion to vaccinate the 4.8 million residents of Jeddah. Vaccinations would significantly\n\nreduce the infections to only three within 28 days, and no deaths would occur. Similarly,\n\nthe productivity loss would be decreased to USD 7770.\n\nTable 1.

Comparison of the interventions.\n\nIntervention Direct Costs\n\n(USD)\n\nInfections\n\n(Mortality) Mortality Cost Productivity Loss Indirect Cost Total Costs\n\nNo InterventionUSD 0 413 (4) USD 2,629,368 USD 1,069,670 USD 3,699,033 USD 3,699,033\n\nQuarantine USD 161,200 5 (1) USD 657,342 USD 269,360 USD 926,702 1,087,902\n\nVaccination USD 36,000,000 3 (0) USD 0 USD 7770 USD 7770 USD 36,007,770\n\nThe above findings show an inverse relationship between the direct and indirect\n\ncosts among the three interventions. While not taking any measures would not incur any\n\ncost at the beginning, the long-term economic impact on the city would be immense. The\n\nnumber of infections and thereby deaths is increasing by the day, thus, causing a huge\n\ndisease burden to the community. In the long run, this would cause a city pandemic,\n\nwhich will attract huge financial implications. On the other hand, quarantine attracts\n\nmoderate direct costs and significantly reduces the number of infections and fatalities.\n\nHowever, the mortality cost and productivity loss are also huge and increase with time.\n\nWhile vaccination incurs a huge direct cost at the beginning, it effectively reduces the\n\ntransmission rate and prevents the loss of lives in the city. This saves a huge amount of\n\nfinances that would otherwise be lost due to isolation or death. Furthermore, vaccination\n\nis a one-off cost that will provide cost savings for many years, as it will ensure the com-\n\nmunity remains healthy and productive.\n\n5\\. Conclusion\n\nDuring a healthcare pandemic, the government is responsible for protecting its citi-\n\nzens from the diverse adverse effects of a disease outbreak. Albeit, at these times of un-\n\nprecedented public health crisis, policymakers are required to respond swiftly and effec-\n\ntively while considering the cascading social and economic consequences of the available\n\nmitigation strategies. Health ministries can either choose to overlook the current wave of\n\nthe monkeypox virus, introduce quarantines to isolate the affected or suspected cases, or\n\nvaccinate the population with the smallpox vaccine. The cost–benefit analysis of these in-\n\nterventions shows that the vaccination is the most rational option, as it would effectively\n\nlimit the spread of the virus while protecting the nation’s productivity. As such, govern-\n\nments worldwide should allocate funds to support mass vaccination programs to protect\n\ntheir citizens from the health, social, and economic consequences of the monkeypox virus.\n\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\n\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\n\nConflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest.\n\nInt.

The proposed model involves six classes of human populations (susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, and recovered) and three classes of rodent populations (susceptible, exposed, and infected). The equilibrium points of the model are disease-free, human-endemic, and endemic. The model has basic reproduction numbers of humans and rodents denoted R0h\\\\mathcal{R}\\_{0h} and R0r\\\\mathcal{R}\\_{0r}, respectively. The disease-free equilibrium always exists and is locally asymptotically stable if max⁡{R0h,R0r}<1\\\\max\\\\left\\\\{\\\\mathcal{R}\\_{0h},\\\\mathcal{R}\\_{0r}\\\\right\\\\}<1. The human-endemic equilibrium point exists and is locally asymptotically stable if R0r<1\\\\mathcal{R}\\_{0r}<1. The endemic equilibrium point exists and is locally asymptotically stable if R0r>1\\\\mathcal{R}\\_{0r}>1. This research aims to study the optimal control of the model with vaccination and culling. We have applied the vaccination control to the human population and the culling control to the rodent population. The optimal control is obtained by minimizing the number of infected humans, the number of infected rodents, and the implementation cost of the controls. This minimization problem has been solved analytically using the modified Pontryagin's minimum principle. We have performed the numerical simulation of optimal control by implementing the modified forward-backward sweep method and setting three strategies: vaccination, culling, and both controls. Based on numerical simulations, the optimal control of both controls is generally the best strategy, followed by culling only and vaccination only, respectively.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377670584_Optimal_control_of_a_fractional-order_monkeypox_epidemic_model_with_vaccination_and_rodents_culling)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

A Compartmental Mathematical Model to Assess the Impact of Vaccination, Isolation, and Key Epidemiological Parameters on Mpox Control. Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 226. https://doi. Abstract Background: Monkeypox (Mpox) is a re-emerging zoonotic disease caused by the mon-keypox virus (MPXV). Transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with lesions or contaminated materials, with sexual transmission playing a significant role in recent outbreaks. In 2022, Mpox triggered a major global outbreak and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO), prompting renewed interest in effective control strategies. Methods: This study developed a compartmental SEIR-based model to assess the epidemiological impact of key interventions, including vaccination and isolation, while incorporating critical epidemiological parameters. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine (1) disease dynamics in relation to the basic reproduction number, and (2) how different parameters influence the curve of symptomatic infections. Real-world continental-scale data were used to validate the model and identify the parameters that most significantly affect epidemic progression and potential control of Mpox. Results: Results showed that the basic reproduction number was most influenced by the recovery rate, vaccination rate, vaccine effectiveness, and transmission rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. In contrast, the progression of symptomatic cases was highly sensitive to the case fatality rate and incubation rate. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of integrated public health strategies combining vaccination, isolation, and early transmission control to mitigate future Mpox outbreaks.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/396389802_A_Compartmental_Mathematical_Model_to_Assess_the_Impact_of_Vaccination_Isolation_and_Key_Epidemiological_Parameters_on_Mpox_Control)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

Methods: A narrative review ofliterature published in the last two years was conducted, using Medical Subject Headings descriptorsin MEDLINE/PubMed and LILACS databases, without language restrictions. Results: New aspects wereidentified regarding its geographical spread and genetic diversification in lineages from clade IIb, as well as the emergence of clade Ib in 2024. New treatment options are described, along with reports of new clinical characteristics and the role of pre- and asymptomatic cases in virus dissemination. Conclusions: The sustained community transmission of clade Ib cases and multiple outbreaks in Africa in 2024 reveal the complex epidemiological state of the virus. Furthermore, the constant reports of cases from clade IIb since the beginning of the outbreak highlight the need for more extensive studies actively searching for asymptomatic carriers and natural reservoirs of the disease, in order to better understand its epidemiology and control its spread\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393443565_Estado_actual_y_avances_en_la_investigacion_de_Mpox_Impacto_de_la_diversificacion_genetica_de_los_clados_I_y_II_Current_status_and_advances_in_Mpox_Research_Impact_of_genetic_diversification_in_clades)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

The model includes the addition of a protected compartment and a saturated transmission rate. We implement a power rescaling for the parameters of the proposed model to ensure dimensional consistency. We have investigated the existence, uniqueness, nonnegativity, and boundedness of the solution. The model features monkeypox-free, human-endemic, and endemic equilibrium points, which depend on the order of derivative. The existence and stability of each equilibrium point have been analyzed locally and globally, depending on the basic reproduction number. Moreover, the basic reproduction number of the model also depends on the order of derivative. We carried out a case study using real data showing that the fractional-order model performs better than the first-order model in calibration and forecasting. Numerical simulations confirm the stability properties of each equilibrium point with respect to the specified parameter values. Numerical simulations also demonstrate that the social distancing habits can reduce monkeypox cases in the early stages, but do not significantly alter the basic reproduction number. Meanwhile, public awareness can substantially modify the basic reproduction number, shifting the endemic condition towards a disease-free state, although its impact on case reduction in the early period is not significant. We also implemented optimal control strategies for vector culling and vaccination in the proposed model. We have solved the optimal control problem, and the simulation results show that the combination of both controls yields the minimum cost with better effectiveness compared to the controls implemented separately.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389666832_Dynamics_and_optimal_control_of_fractional-order_monkeypox_epidemic_model_with_social_distancing_habits_and_public_awareness)\n\nShow abstract\n\n... This is partly due to the limited clinical relevance mpox had before the 2022-2023 outbreak due to coincident immunity to the mpox virus previously achieved through smallpox vaccination and very limited transmission globally. However, in affected areas where transmission is growing, vaccination of at-risk populations can be a cost-effective strategy helping to mitigate high healthcare costs and productivity losses (Alshahrani, 2022). Particularly, the areas of the endemic countries in Western and Central Africa can benefit from mpox vaccinations where people from lower socio-economic groups are more likely to contract mpox due to their higher frequency of human-animal interaction and reliance of bushmeat as a source for protein (Quiner et al., 2017). ...\n\n[Monkeypox Outbreak 2022, from a Rare Disease to Global Health Emergence: Implications for Travellers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380908547_Monkeypox_Outbreak_2022_from_a_Rare_Disease_to_Global_Health_Emergence_Implications_for_Travellers)\n\nChapter\n\nFull-text available\n\n- May 2024\n- ADV EXP MED BIOL\n\n- [![Oyelola A Adegboye](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/279914788999180-1443748294746_Q64/Oyelola-Adegboye.jpg)Oyelola A Adegboye](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oyelola-Adegboye)\n- [![Faith Osaretin Alele](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/11431281086244385-1664188216208_Q64/Faith-Alele.jpg)Faith Osaretin Alele](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Faith-Alele)\n- [![Anton Pak](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/885440496283649-1588116873082_Q64/Anton-Pak.jpg)Anton Pak](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anton-Pak)\n- [![Malachy Ifeanyi Okeke](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/280016047886348-1443772436935_Q64/Malachy-Okeke.jpg)Malachy Ifeanyi Okeke](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Malachy-Okeke)\n\nMonkeypox (mpox), a zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), poses a significant public health threat with the potential for global dissemination beyond its endemic regions in Central and West Africa. This study explores the multifaceted aspects of monkeypox, covering its epidemiology, genomics, travel-related spread, mass gathering implications, and economic consequences. Epidemiologically, mpox exhibits distinct patterns, with variations in age and gender susceptibility. Severe cases can arise in immunocompromised individuals, underscoring the importance of understanding the factors contributing to its transmission. Genomic analysis of MPXV highlights its evolutionary relationship with the variola virus and vaccinia virus. Different MPXV clades exhibit varying levels of virulence and transmission potential, with Clade I associated with higher mortality rates. Moreover, the role of recombination in MPXV evolution remains a subject of interest, with implications for understanding its genetic diversity. Travel and mass gatherings play a pivotal role in the spread of monkeypox. The ease of international travel and increasing globalization have led to outbreaks beyond African borders. The economic ramifications of mpox outbreaks extend beyond public health. Direct treatment costs, productivity losses, and resource-intensive control efforts can strain healthcare systems and economies. While vaccination and mitigation strategies have proven effective, the cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination in non-endemic countries remains a subject of debate. This study emphasizes the role of travel, mass gatherings, and genomics in its spread and underscores the economic impacts on affected regions. Enhancing surveillance, vaccination strategies, and public health measures are essential in controlling this emerging infectious disease.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380908547_Monkeypox_Outbreak_2022_from_a_Rare_Disease_to_Global_Health_Emergence_Implications_for_Travellers)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

In light of this crisis, this study aims to analyze the global knowledge pattern of monkeypox-related patents and explore current trends and future technical directions in the medical development of monkeypox to inform research and policy.\n\nMethods\nA comprehensive study of 1,791 monkeypox-related patents worldwide was conducted using the Derwent patent database by descriptive statistics, social network method and linear regression analysis.\n\nResults\nSince the 21st century, the number of monkeypox-related patents has increased rapidly, accompanied by increases in collaboration between commercial and academic patentees. Enterprises contributed the most in patent quantity, whereas the initial milestone patent was filed by academia. The core developments of technology related to the monkeypox include biological and chemical medicine. The innovations of vaccines and virus testing lack sufficient patent support in portfolios.\n\nConclusions\nMonkeypox-related therapeutic innovation is geographically limited with strong international intellectual property right barriers though it has increased rapidly in recent years. The transparent licensing of patent knowledge is driven by the merger and acquisition model, and the venture capital, intellectual property and contract research organization model. Currently, the patent thicket phenomenon in the monkeypox field may slow the progress of efforts to combat monkeypox. Enterprises should pay more attention to the sharing of technical knowledge, make full use of drug repurposing strategies, and promote innovation of monkeypox-related technology in hotspots of antivirals (such as tecovirimat, cidofovir, brincidofovir), vaccines (JYNNEOS, ACAM2000), herbal medicine and gene therapy.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379835205_The_global_patent_landscape_of_emerging_infectious_disease_monkeypox)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the association between engagement in HIV-associated healthcare and mpox diagnosis, as well as to characterize cases of mpox among PWH. The DC Cohort is a longitudinal cohort of PWH in Washington, DC. We conducted a 5:1 (controls:cases) nested case-cohort study on male participants, matching age and care site. Cases were participants with an identified mpox diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the impact of indicators of engagement in HIV-associated healthcare on mpox diagnosis. We identified 70 cases of mpox in DC Cohort participants randomly matched to 323 controls, for a total of 393 participants included in the analysis. Study participants were primarily non-Hispanic Black (72.3%) with a median age of 41 (IQR: 36, 50).

While generally considered milder than smallpox, it can lead to severe cardiovascular complications. The virus primarily spreads through contact with infected animals or through human-to-human transmission. Cardiovascular involvement in human monkeypox is rare but has been associated with myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, and even fulminant myocardial infarction. Vaccination plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling monkeypox, but the eradication of smallpox has left global populations vulnerable. This review explores the cardiovascular manifestations of human monkeypox, the role of vaccination in disease prevention, and the importance of continued research and development of effective vaccines to protect against this emerging infectious threat. The global impact of monkeypox outbreaks, particularly on vulnerable populations, further highlights the importance of understanding and addressing this disease.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377075676_Role_of_vaccination_in_patients_with_human_monkeypox_virus_and_its_cardiovascular_manifestations)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[How Ready is Primary Care for Mpox (Monkeypox)?

Family physicians are the first healthcare professionals patients can apply for health. This study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge of family physicians about mpox.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted. A survey was conducted between March 14, 2023 and April 14 of 2023 to evaluate the knowledge of mpox among 102 family physicians in Gaziantep, Turkey. The collected data were analyzed to determine physicians’ knowledge of the disease, its symptoms, transmission, and treatment options.\n\nResults\nAt the 80% cut-off, 8.8% of family physicians had good knowledge; at the 70% cut-off, 35.3% of physicians had good knowledge. The highest level of knowledge was observed in those working for 5 years or less; the lowest level was observed in those working for 6-15 years (p=0.045). The most correct answer (n=98) was “What is the type of microorganism that causes mpox?”. The question with the most incorrect answers (n=90) was “A definitive diagnosis is made using ELISA tests”.\n\nConclusion\nFamily physicians are the first health professionals to access the virus, particularly in cases of community transmission. Identify areas where physicians need additional education and training to better diagnose and treat mpox.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383123578_How_Ready_is_Primary_Care_for_Mpox_Monkeypox_Mpox_Knowledge_Level_Among_Family_Physicians_A_Prospective_Cross-sectional_Study)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Willingness to accept monkeypox vaccine and its correlates among men who have sex with men in Southern China: a web-based online cross-sectional study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378392998_Willingness_to_accept_monkeypox_vaccine_and_its_correlates_among_men_who_have_sex_with_men_in_Southern_China_a_web-based_online_cross-sectional_study)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Feb 2024\n\n- [Xinju Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Xinju-Huang-2260304080)\n- [Zhifeng Lin](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Zhifeng-Lin-2260307206)\n- [![Jiao Qin](https://c5.rgstatic.net/m/4671872220764/images/template/default/profile/profile_default_m.jpg)Jiao Qin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiao-Qin-8)\n- [![Liang Bingyu](https://i1.rgstatic.net/ii/profile.image/1144588924403715-1649902673877_Q64/Liang-Bingyu-2.jpg)Liang Bingyu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Bingyu-2)\n\nBackground\nThe May 2022 global outbreak of monkeypox (MPX) poses a threat to the health of men who have sex with men. However, there is limited data on the willingness of MSM to receive monkeypox vaccination in Southern China. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of MPX, concerns regarding MPX, and willingness to receive monkeypox vaccination, as well as their correlates, among MSM in China.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a Web-based online survey of MSM in Southern China from August to September 2022. Data were collected on the socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, worries, concerns regarding MPX and willingness to receive monkeypox vaccination. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to explore the factors associated with willingness to receive monkeypox vaccination.\n\nResults\nA total of 1903 participants completed the survey. Among them, approximately 69.9% reported being aware of MPX awareness, 94.1% of the participants supported the promotion of monkeypox vaccination. The majority of participants (91.4%) expressed their willingness to receive monkeypox vaccination. Participants who considered monkeypox vaccination safe \\[adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.82, 95% CI: 1.35–17.18\\], agreed on the necessity of government promotion of monkeypox vaccination in China (aOR = 6.03, 95% CI: 1.07–33.93), believed in prioritizing monkeypox vaccination for MSM (aOR = 5.01, 95% CI: 1.10–22.71), and had friends or sexual partners who had already received the monkeypox or smallpox vaccination (aOR = 10.37, 95% CI: 2.11–50.99) are more likely to be vaccinated. Conversely, married individuals (aOR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03–0.47), those engaging in anal sex 4–6 times per week in the past 3 months (aOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09–0.77) expressed hesitancy toward monkeypox vaccination.\n\nConclusion\nThere was a high willingness to receive monkeypox vaccination among MSM in China. The hesitancy toward the monkeypox vaccine can be effectively mitigated by addressing concerns about its safety and potential adverse reactions. Moreover, increasing acceptance of the monkeypox vaccination among MSM and their peers is crucial, as social influence significantly impacts vaccine attitudes and behaviors.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378392998_Willingness_to_accept_monkeypox_vaccine_and_its_correlates_among_men_who_have_sex_with_men_in_Southern_China_a_web-based_online_cross-sectional_study)\n\nShow abstract\n\nShow more\n\n[Monkeypox Virus Infection in Humans across 16 Countries — April–June 2022](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362168955_Monkeypox_Virus_Infection_in_Humans_across_16_Countries_-_April-June_2022)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jul 2022\n\n- [![John Thornhill](<Base64-Image-Removed>)John Thornhill](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Thornhill)\n- [Sapha Barkati](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Sapha-Barkati-2210578920)\n- [![Sharon Walmsley](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Sharon Walmsley](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sharon-Walmsley)\n- [![Donald C Vinh](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Donald C Vinh](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald-Vinh)\n\nBackground:\nBefore April 2022, monkeypox virus infection in humans was seldom reported outside African regions where it is endemic. Currently, cases are occurring worldwide. Transmission, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes of infection are poorly defined.\n\nMethods:\nWe formed an international collaborative group of clinicians who contributed to an international case series to describe the presentation, clinical course, and outcomes of polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed monkeypox virus infections.\n\nResults:\nWe report 528 infections diagnosed between April 27 and June 24, 2022, at 43 sites in 16 countries. Overall, 98% of the persons with infection were gay or bisexual men, 75% were White, and 41% had human immunodeficiency virus infection; the median age was 38 years. Transmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the persons with infection. In this case series, 95% of the persons presented with a rash (with 64% having <10 lesions), 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions (with 54 having a single genital lesion). Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), and headache (27%); lymphadenopathy was also common (reported in 56%). Concomitant sexually transmitted infections were reported in 109 of 377 persons (29%) who were tested. Among the 23 persons with a clear exposure history, the median incubation period was 7 days (range, 3 to 20). Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 persons in whom seminal fluid was analyzed. Antiviral treatment was given to 5% of the persons overall, and 70 (13%) were hospitalized; the reasons for hospitalization were pain management, mostly for severe anorectal pain (21 persons); soft-tissue superinfection (18); pharyngitis limiting oral intake (5); eye lesions (2); acute kidney injury (2); myocarditis (2); and infection-control purposes (13). No deaths were reported.\n\nConclusions:\nIn this case series, monkeypox manifested with a variety of dermatologic and systemic clinical findings. The simultaneous identification of cases outside areas where monkeypox has traditionally been endemic highlights the need for rapid identification and diagnosis of cases to contain further community spread.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362168955_Monkeypox_Virus_Infection_in_Humans_across_16_Countries_-_April-June_2022)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Prevention and Treatment of Monkeypox](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361590580_Prevention_and_Treatment_of_Monkeypox)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jun 2022\n\n- [![John G.

Monkeypox is transmitted incidentally to humans when they encounter infected animals. Reports have shown that the virus can also be transmitted through direct contact (sexual or skin-to-skin), respiratory droplets, and via fomites such as towels and bedding. Multiple medical countermeasures are stockpiled for orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox. Two vaccines are currently available, JYNNEOSTM (live, replication incompetent vaccinia virus) and ACAM2000® (live, replication competent vaccinia virus). While most cases of monkeypox will have mild and self-limited disease, with supportive care being typically sufficient, antivirals (e.g. tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir) and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) are available as treatments. Antivirals can be considered in severe disease, immunocompromised patients, pediatrics, pregnant and breastfeeding women, complicated lesions, and when lesions appear near the mouth, eyes, and genitals. The purpose of this short review is to describe each of these countermeasures.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361590580_Prevention_and_Treatment_of_Monkeypox)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[The Economic Effects of COVID-19 Containment Measures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357031216_The_Economic_Effects_of_COVID-19_Containment_Measures)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Feb 2022\n- OPEN ECON REV\n\n- [Pragyan Deb](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Pragyan-Deb-2184871898)\n- [Davide Furceri](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Davide-Furceri-14984687)\n- [![Jonathan David Ostry](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Jonathan David Ostry](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Ostry)\n- [Nour Tawk](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Nour-Tawk-2184849552)\n\nThis paper examines the economic effects of COVID-19 containment measures using daily global data on containment measures, infections, and economic activity indicators, such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2){\\\\mathrm{NO}}\\_{2}) emissions, international and domestic flights, energy consumption, maritime trade, and mobility indices. Results suggest that containment measures had a significant impact on economic activity—equivalent to about a 10 percent loss in industrial production over 30 days following their implementation. Easing of containment measures results in an increase in economic activity, but the effect is lower (in absolute value) to that of tightening. Fiscal measures used to mitigate the crisis were effective in partly offsetting these costs. We also find that school closures and cancellation of public events are among the most effective measures in curbing infections and are associated with low economic costs. Other highly effective measures like workplace closures and international travel restrictions are among the costliest in economic terms.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357031216_The_Economic_Effects_of_COVID-19_Containment_Measures)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Economic burden of COVID-19, China, January–March, 2020: a cost-of-illness study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348925133_Economic_burden_of_COVID-19_China_January-March_2020_a_cost-of-illness_study)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Feb 2021\n- B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN\n\n- [![Huajie Jin](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Huajie Jin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huajie-Jin)\n- [Haiyin Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Haiyin-Wang-2167420622)\n- [![Xiao Li](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Xiao Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiao-Li-133)\n- [![Mark Pennington](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Mark Pennington](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Pennington)\n\nObjective:\nTo estimate the economic cost of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in 31 provincial-level administrative regions and in total, in China.\n\nMethods:\nWe used data from government reports, clinical guidelines and other publications to estimate the main cost components of COVID-19 during 1 January-31 March 2020. These components were: identification and diagnosis of close contacts; suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19; treatment of COVID-19 cases; compulsory quarantine of close contacts and suspected cases; and productivity losses for all affected residents. Primary outcomes were total health-care and societal costs.\n\nFindings:\nThe total estimated health-care and societal costs associated with COVID-19 were 4.26 billion Chinese yuan (¥; 0.62 billion United States dollars, US)and¥2646.70billion(US) and ¥ 2646.70 billion (US 383.02 billion), respectively. Inpatient care accounted for 44.2% (¥ 0.95 billion/¥ 2.15 billion) of routine health-care costs followed by medicines, accounting for 32.5% (¥ 0.70 billion/¥ 2.15 billion). Productivity losses accounted for 99.8% (¥ 2641.61 billion/¥ 2646.70 billion) of societal costs, which were mostly attributable to the effect of movement-restriction policies on people who did not have COVID-19. Societal costs were most sensitive to salary costs and number of working days lost due to movement-restriction policies. Hubei province had the highest health-care cost while Guangdong province had the highest societal cost.\n\nConclusion:\nOur results highlight the high economic burden of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The control measures to prevent the spread of disease resulted in substantial costs from productivity losses amounting to 2.7% (US382.29billion/US 382.29 billion/US 14.14 trillion) of China's annual gross domestic product.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348925133_Economic_burden_of_COVID-19_China_January-March_2020_a_cost-of-illness_study)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Pandemics Depress the Economy, Public Health Interventions Do Not: Evidence from the 1918 Flu](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365982872_Pandemics_Depress_the_Economy_Public_Health_Interventions_Do_Not_Evidence_from_the_1918_Flu)\n\nArticle\n\n- Dec 2022\n\n- [Sergio Correia](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Sergio-Correia-2145141535)\n- [Stephan Luck](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Stephan-Luck-2128169220)\n- [Emil Verner](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Emil-Verner-2141628900)\n\nWe study the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on mortality and economic activity across U.S. cities during the 1918 Flu Pandemic.

However, while the pandemic itself was associated with short-run economic disruptions, we find that these disruptions were similar across cities with strict and lenient NPIs. NPIs also did not worsen medium-run economic outcomes. Our findings indicate that NPIs can reduce disease transmission without further depressing economic activity, a finding also reflected in discussions in contemporary newspapers.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365982872_Pandemics_Depress_the_Economy_Public_Health_Interventions_Do_Not_Evidence_from_the_1918_Flu)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Monkeypox: Gay and bisexual men with high exposure risk will be offered vaccine in England](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361483403_Monkeypox_Gay_and_bisexual_men_with_high_exposure_risk_will_be_offered_vaccine_in_England)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jun 2022\n- Br Med J\n\n- [Elisabeth Mahase](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Elisabeth-Mahase-2224364748)\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361483403_Monkeypox_Gay_and_bisexual_men_with_high_exposure_risk_will_be_offered_vaccine_in_England)\n\n[The 1918 Influenza Pandemic and Its Lessons for COVID-19](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359072802_The_1918_Influenza_Pandemic_and_Its_Lessons_for_COVID-19)\n\nArticle\n\n- Mar 2022\n- J ECON LIT\n\n- [Brian Beach](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Brian-Beach-2105842669)\n- [![Karen Clay](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Karen Clay](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen-Clay-3)\n- [![Martin Saavedra](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Martin Saavedra](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Saavedra)\n\nThis article reviews the global health and economic consequences of the 1918 influenza pandemic, with a particular focus on topics that have seen a renewed interest because of COVID-19.

This study proposes and applies a modification of the SIR infection model to describe the evolution of coronavirus infections and to measure the effect of quarantine on the number of people infected.\nMethods: Two hypotheses, not necessarily mutually exclusive, are proposed for the impact of quarantines. According to the first hypothesis, quarantine reduces the infection rate, delaying new infections over time without modifying the total number of people infected at the end of the wave. The second hypothesis establishes that quarantine reduces the population infected in the wave. The two hypotheses are tested with data for a sample of 10 districts in Santiago, Chile.\nResults: The results of applying the methodology show that the proposed model describes well the evolution of infections at the district level. The data shows evidence in favor of the first hypothesis, quarantine reduces the infection rate; and not in favor of the second hypothesis, that quarantine reduces the population infected. Districts of higher socio-economic levels have a lower infection rate, and quarantine is more effective.\nConclusions: Quarantine, in most districts, does not reduce the total number of people infected in the wave; it only reduces the rate at which they are infected. The reduction in the infection rate avoids peaks that may collapse the health system.\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349951270_The_impact_of_quarantine_on_Covid-19_infections)\n\nShow abstract\n\nShow more\n\n**We and our partners use cookies** ✕\n\nBy using this site, you consent to the processing of your personal data, the storing of cookies on your device, and the use of similar technologies for personalization, ads, analytics, etc. For more information or to opt out, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.researchgate.net/privacy-policy)\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/track/consume-asset?pid=364662676&lid=6356898a8d4484154a2d3dfc&fp=e949de8111f1c09fa9a78766da917a20752332f0&init=1)",
