This study analyzed 100 Google News reports from June 2025. Nonmainstream outlets published more credentialed content (31.6% vs 11.6%, _P_ = .02), yet fewer than 25% cited research. Most reports were informational (94%) and pro-vaccination (72%), though 28% presented mixed messaging. Findings highlight gaps in evidence-based reporting and opportunities for improved health communication.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Background\n\nMeasles ranks among the most contagious respiratory diseases, with host-level factors, particularly age, vaccination, and immunity status, playing a primary role.1, 2 A cross-sectional study using national surveillance data and found that 88% of cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals.1 School vaccination exemption policies significantly influence outbreak risk, with relaxed state laws strongly associated with higher measles frequency.3 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n## Methods\n\nThe methods for this study were based on prior research.8 Using an incognito browser, Google News was searched on June 16, 2025, with the keywords “Measles AND United States.” The first 100 English-language news reports (written, visual, or audio) referencing both measles and the US were included and coded for content and metadata. The cutoff of 100 articles was chosen to capture a manageable yet comprehensive snapshot of the most visible outbreak-related coverage, as prior studies have.8\n\n## Results\n\nOf the 100 online news reports related to measles in June 2025, 43% were posted by mainstream digital news sources. Less than one-quarter of reports (23%) were posted by credentialed authors, meaning reliable professional (medical or public health) professionals or organizations. Other digital news sources presented information from credentialed sources 3 times more often than mainstream digital news sources (31.6% vs 11.6%, _P_ = .02). Only 21% cited research related to measles causes, control,\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis content analysis reveals several patterns with implications for public health communication. In this sample, nonmainstream digital outlets were accessed more frequently than mainstream sources. This phenomenon reflects the changing landscape of news coverage with audiences tending to prefer locally relevant government, political, and social news and coverage of community-specific issues.9 Regardless of outlet type, nearly all reports conveyed an informative or neutral tone; however, fewer\n\n## Conclusions\n\nFuture research could expand to longitudinal tracking of media trends, and audience reception studies to assess how coverage shapes knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors during measles outbreaks. By mapping what the public encounters online, these insights can guide health agencies and journalists alike to close informational gaps, counter misinformation, and ultimately strengthen community resilience against measles and other vaccine-preventable threats.\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- F.

When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people in the United States, outbreaks can occur.\n\nSkip Over Map Container\n\n2023-242022-232021-222020-212019-202018-192017-182016-172015-162014-152013-142012-132011-122010-112009-10\n\nSkip Data Table\n\nData Table\n\n| LocationSort by Location in descending order | CategorySort by Category in descending order | Estimated Percent VaccinatedSort by Estimated Percent Vaccinated in descending order | School YearSort by School Year in descending order | Population SizeSort by Population Size in descending order | Percent SurveyedSort by Percent Surveyed in descending order | Survey TypeSort by Survey Type in descending order |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | 90-94.9% | 93.8% | 2023-24 | 54,565 | 100% | Census |\n| Alaska | Less than 90% | 84.3% | 2023-24 | 8,644 | 88.9% | Census (pub.), Not Conducted (prv.) |\n| Arizona | Less than 90% | 89.3% | 2023-24 | 74,834 | 99.6% | Census |\n| Arkansas | 90-94.9% | 92.5% | 2023-24 | 37,535 | 95.4% | Census (pub.), Vol. Response (prv.) |\n| California | 95%+ | 96.2% | 2023-24 | 569,680 | 100% | Census |\n| Colorado | Less than 90% | 88.3% | 2023-24 | 61,662 | 100% | Census |\n| Connecticut | 95%+ | 97.7% | 2023-24 | 36,184 | 100% | Census |\n| Delaware | 90-94.9% | 93.8% | 2023-24 | 11,043 | 11.5% | Stratified 2-stage Cluster Sample |\n| District Of Columbia | 90-94.9% | 92.0% | 2023-24 | 7,874 | 100% | Census |\n| Florida | Less than 90% | 88.1% | 2023-24 | 228,213 | 100% | Census |\n| Georgia | Less than 90% | 88.4% | 2023-24 | 136,943 | 100% | Census |\n| Hawaii | Less than 90% | 89.8% | 2023-24 | 13,995 | 8.2% | Stratified 2-stage Cluster Sample |\n| Houston | 90-94.9% | 93.6% | 2023-24 | 37,882 | 67.7% | Vol. Response |\n| Idaho | Less than 90% | 79.6% | 2023-24 | 22,376 | 100% | Census |\n| Illinois | 90-94.9% | 91.6% | 2023-24 | 133,578 | 100% | Census |\n| Indiana | 90-94.9% | 90.8% | 2023-24 | 80,639 | 88.5% | Census (pub.), Vol. Response (prv.) |\n| Iowa | Less than 90% | 89.1% | 2023-24 | 38,611 | 100% | Census |\n| Kansas | 90-94.9% | 90.4% | 2023-24 | 34,178 | 37.1% | Stratified 1-stage Cluster Sample |\n| Kentucky | 90-94.9% | 90.0% | 2023-24 | 52,609 | 100% | Census |\n| Louisiana | 90-94.9% | 92.4% | 2023-24 | 51,839 | 100% | Census |\n| Maine | 95%+ | 97.5% | 2023-24 | 12,087 | 93.0% | Census |\n| Maryland | 95%+ | 96.6% | 2023-24 | 63,224 | 100% | Census |\n| Massachusetts | 95%+ | 96.3% | 2023-24 | 65,424 | 100% | Census |\n| Michigan | 90-94.9% | 92.1% | 2023-24 | 110,156 | 100% | Census |\n| Minnesota | Less than 90% | 87.0% | 2023-24 | 66,032 | 99.1% | Census |\n| Mississippi | 95%+ | 97.5% | 2023-24 | 36,105 | 100% | Census |\n| Missouri | 90-94.9% | 90.4% | 2023-24 | 69,014 | 100% | Census |\n| Nebraska | 90-94.9% | 93.9% | 2023-24 | 23,118 | 100% | Census |\n| Nevada | 90-94.9% | 91.9% | 2023-24 | 31,261 | 91.3% | Census |\n| New Hampshire | Less than 90% | 89.2% | 2023-24 | 11,871 | 100% | Census |\n| New Jersey | 90-94.9% | 93.2% | 2023-24 | 105,408 | 100% | Census |\n| New Mexico | 95%+ | 95.0% | 2023-24 | 20,699 | 100% | Census |\n| New York | 95%+ | 97.7% | 2023-24 | 200,894 | 98.8% | Census |\n| New York City | 95%+ | 96.7% | 2023-24 | 85,360 | 99.3% | Census |\n| North Carolina | 90-94.9% | 93.8% | 2023-24 | 125,964 | 90.8% | Census (pub.), Vol. Response (prv.) |\n| North Dakota | 90-94.9% | 91.0% | 2023-24 | 9,674 | 97.8% | Census |\n| Ohio | Less than 90% | 89.2% | 2023-24 | 133,716 | 94.0% | Census (pub.), Vol. Response (prv.) |\n| Oklahoma | Less than 90% | 88.3% | 2023-24 | 49,979 | 93.8% | Census (pub.), Vol. Response (prv.) |\n| Oregon | 90-94.9% | 91.2% | 2023-24 | 39,568 | 100% | Census |\n| Pennsylvania | 90-94.9% | 93.5% | 2023-24 | 137,593 | 96.5% | Census |\n| Rhode Island | 95%+ | 97.1% | 2023-24 | 10,539 | 97.8% | Census |\n| South Carolina | 90-94.9% | 92.1% | 2023-24 | 58,069 | 26.7% | Stratified 1-stage Cluster Sample |\n| South Dakota | 90-94.9% | 90.8% | 2023-24 | 11,744 | 99.8% | Census |\n| Tennessee | 95%+ | 95.1% | 2023-24 | 79,323 | 95.8% | Census |\n| Texas | 90-94.9% | 94.3% | 2023-24 | 381,421 | 92.4% | Census (pub.), Vol. Response (prv.) |\n| Utah | Less than 90% | 88.8% | 2023-24 | 46,228 | 100% | Census |\n| Vermont | 90-94.9% | 92.9% | 2023-24 | 5,630 | 100% | Census |\n| Virginia | 90-94.9% | 94.2% | 2023-24 | 92,633 | 1.9% | Stratified 2-stage Cluster Sample |\n| Washington | 90-94.9% | 91.3% | 2023-24 | 84,053 | 97.2% | Census |\n| West Virginia | 95%+ | 98.3% | 2023-24 | 18,261 | 82.8% | Vol. Response |\n| Wisconsin | Less than 90% | 84.8% | 2023-24 | 62,028 | 98.2% | Census |\n| Wyoming | 90-94.9% | 93.5% | 2023-24 | 6,754 | 100% | Census |\n\nData table showing data for the United States Map figure.\n\nDownload Data (CSV)\n\nSkipped data table.\n\nNote: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New Jersey did not assess coverage for individual vaccines.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

All other countries continue to maintain their measles elimination status.\n\n“This loss represents a setback—but it is also reversible,” said Dr. Barbosa, “Until measles is eliminated worldwide, our Region will continue to face the risk of reintroduction and spread of the virus among unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. However, as we have demonstrated before, with political commitment, regional cooperation, and sustained vaccination, the Region can once again interrupt transmission and reclaim this collective achievement.”\n\n## Current situation\n\nAs of 7 November 2025, 12,596 confirmed measles cases have been reported across ten countries (approximately 95% of the Region’s cases in Canada, Mexico and US), a 30-fold increase compared to 2024. Twenty-eight deaths have been recorded: 23 in Mexico, 3 in the United States, and 2 in Canada.\n\nActive outbreaks are ongoing in Canada, Mexico, the United States, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize, mostly triggered by imported cases. Transmission has primarily affected under-vaccinated communities, with 89% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status. Children under 1 year of age are the most affected, followed by those aged one to four years.\n\nCanada’s measles outbreak began in October 2024 in the province of New Brunswick and has since spread nationwide, with more than 5,000 confirmed cases reported nationwide. Although declining, transmission persists in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.\n\nMeasles is highly contagious. A single infected person can transmit it to up to 18 others. Severe complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and death. Outbreaks also disrupt daily life and place additional pressure on health systems.\n\nVaccination remains the most effective means of protection. Over the past 25 years, the measles vaccine has prevented more than six million deaths across the Americas —and an estimated 15 million deaths over the last 50 years. Nevertheless, in 2024, regional coverage for the second dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR2) averaged 79%—well below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In addition, only 31% of countries reached 95% or more coverage for the first dose, and just 20% achieved that level for the second dose.\n\n## PAHO’s response and recommendations\n\nPAHO continues to provide technical support to countries to strengthen surveillance, laboratory diagnosis, outbreak response, and vaccination campaigns. Experts have been deployed to Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia, and the organization is monitoring risks in Belize, Brazil and Paraguay.\n\nDr. Barbosa emphasized: “Every case we prevent, every outbreak we stop saves lives, protects families, and makes communities healthier. Today, rather than lamenting the loss of a regional status, we call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen vaccination rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases—reaching every corner of the Americas. As a Region, we have eliminated measles twice. We can do it a third time.”\n\n**RVC strongly encourages countries to:**\n\n- Continue strengthening surveillance, immunization and outbreak rapid response activities for every suspect case.\n- Expand and consolidate electronic immunization registries across all countries, following PAHO’s established guidelines.\n- Maintain sustainable laboratory surveillance by allocating sufficient financial and human resources.\n- For suspected cases with clinical and epidemiological risk factors and a negative measles IgM result (with specimens collected within 0–3 days after rash onset), perform PCR testing to confirm or rule out infection.\n- Implement all recommendations down to the local level.\n- Document outbreak closure following the [Regional Framework](https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/56855) guidelines.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe Americas have previously faced setbacks, including temporary loss of measles elimination status in Venezuela (2018) and Brazil (2019). The region regained elimination status in 2024 through coordinated regional action.\n\nTo regain measles elimination status, a country must demonstrate interruption of endemic transmission for at least 12 consecutive months, supported by comprehensive vaccination, surveillance, and outbreak-response data.\n\nCanada will now present and implement an action plan under PAHO’s regional framework, focused on boosting immunization coverage, reinforcing surveillance systems, and ensuring rapid outbreak response to stop endemic transmission and regaining measles elimination status.\n\n“Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus—because when we work together, we protect the health and lives of all people in the Americas,” Dr. Barbosa concluded.\n\n[News Releases](https://www.paho.org/en/news/news-releases)\n\n[Measles](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles)\n\n[Brasil](https://www.paho.org/pt/brasil)\n\n[Comprehensive Immunization (CIM)](https://www.paho.org/en/comprehensive-immunization-cim)\n\n## Latest news\n\n[![Measles patient](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/measles-patient.jpg?h=ae97dba1&itok=bnGMZyUl)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n[PAHO calls for regional action as the Americas lose measles elimination status](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n10 Nov 2025\n\n[![Arrival of aid to Jamaica](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/emt-aecid-llegada.jpg?h=eed8f32f&itok=Hh60dlMe)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n[PAHO scales up its emergency health response across the Caribbean following Hurricane Melissa](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[![Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO, Florika Fink-Hooijer, Director-General of HERA, and European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, who oversees HERA within the European Commission.](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/acuerdo-comision-europea.jpg?h=717d0fcf&itok=qG_9hwe-)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n[PAHO and European Commission’s Health Emergency Authority make deal to boost preparedness for cross-border health threats](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[See all the news](https://www.paho.org/en/news)",

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

This study analyzed 100 Google News reports from June 2025. Nonmainstream outlets published more credentialed content (31.6% vs 11.6%, P = .02), yet fewer than 25% cited research. Most reports were informational (94%) and pro-vaccination (72%), though 28% presented mixed messaging. Findings highlight gaps in evidence-based reporting and opportunities for improved health communication.\n\n\n**Keywords:**\n\nContagious disease news coverage; Digital news; Health Communication; Health information; Internet news; Measles.\n\n\nCopyright © 2025 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.
