When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

As of April 17, a total of 800 cases have been reported in the United States in 2025; 654 (82%) cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas have been associated with the ongoing outbreak. These cases represent an approximately 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024, and the second highest annual case count in the United States in 25 years. Overall, 771 (96%) patients have been unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status (77% were unvaccinated, and 14% had unknown vaccination status when excluding 590 cases reported by Texas, which requires explicit consent by law \\[i.e., opt-in\\] to enroll in the Texas Immunization Registry), 85 (11%) patients have been hospitalized, and three patients have died. Among 48 (6%) internationally imported cases, 44 (92%) occurred among U.S. residents. Endemic measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 as a direct result of high 2-dose childhood coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur when travelers with measles return to the United States while they are infectious; larger U.S. outbreaks typically follow importation into close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage. Nationally, risk for widespread measles transmission remains low because of high population-level immunity. To prepare for and prevent measles cases and outbreaks, public health departments should continue working with trusted community messengers on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and other community infection prevention approaches (e.g., case isolation, contact monitoring, and post-exposure prophylaxis) and coordinating with health care facilities and schools. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMeasles is the most highly contagious febrile rash illness, infecting up to 90% of susceptible close contacts and resulting in serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Among the 4,056 measles cases reported in the United States during 2001–2022, a total of 727 (18%) were hospitalized, and three deaths were reported [\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN1); of the 727 hospitalized patients, 473 (65%) were unvaccinated, and 187 (26%) had unknown vaccination status ( [_1_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R1)). Worldwide, measles vaccination is estimated to have saved 93.7 million lives during 1974–2024 and played a substantial role in reducing childhood mortality ( [_2_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R2)) by preventing complications associated with measles and deaths from other infectious diseases as a consequence of measles-related immunosuppression ( [_3_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R3)).\n\nEndemic measles transmission was declared eliminated [†](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN2) in the United States in 2000 after a change from a 1-dose to a 2-dose measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination schedule in 1989 ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R4)). However, a recent resurgence in global measles, resulting from COVID-19 pandemic–related challenges in implementing measles vaccination routine services and campaigns, has increased the risk for imported cases and outbreaks in the United States, particularly when U.S. travelers are exposed to measles abroad and return to the United States while they are infectious ( [_5_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R5)). Although the United States still benefits from high population immunity from routine MMR vaccination, declining immunization rates among school-aged children and communities with already low vaccination coverage threaten a resurgence of measles, along with its potentially serious associated complications. For this report, CDC used national surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of measles cases and outbreaks reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Data Source and Case Classification\n\nState health departments notify CDC of confirmed measles cases [§](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN3) ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)) through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and directly (by email or telephone) to the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Measles vaccination status is ascertained by health departments during each case investigation; patients with written or electronic documentation of receipt of ≥1 dose of a measles-containing vaccine ≥14 days before rash onset are considered vaccinated, and all other patients are classified as unvaccinated or as having unknown measles vaccination status. [¶](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN4) Measles cases are classified by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists as internationally imported if 1) at least part of the exposure period (7–21 days before rash onset) occurred outside the United States, 2) rash onset occurred within 21 days of entering the United States, and 3) no known exposure to measles occurred in the United States. All other cases are classified as U.S.-acquired ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). For this analysis, patients with imported measles cases were classified as age-eligible for vaccination if they were aged ≥6 months and were not vaccinated according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R4)).\n\n### Analysis of Outbreaks\n\nA measles outbreak was defined as the occurrence of three or more epidemiologically linked [\\*\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN5) cases. Unique measles virus sequences are defined as those differing by at least one nucleotide in the N-450 sequence (i.e., the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminal 150 nucleoprotein amino acids) based on standard World Health Organization recommendations for describing sequence variants [††](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN6) ( [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R7)). Patients with confirmed vaccine reactions (i.e., rash caused by a reaction to vaccine strain virus) were not included as persons with measles cases, as studies have found no confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission of the measles vaccine strain virus ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. [§§](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN7)\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of Reported Measles Cases\n\nDuring January 1–April 17, 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported in 25 U.S. jurisdictions ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#F1)). The highest number of weekly cases (99) was reported during the week ending March 22 ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#F2)). Median patient age was 9 years (IQR = 4–23 years); 249 (31%) patients were aged <5 years, 304 (38%) were aged 5–19 years, 231 (29%) were aged ≥20 years, and age was unknown for 16 (2%) patients ( [Table](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#T1)). Among all measles patients, 771 (96%) were unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, 10 (1%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and 19 (2%) had received 2 doses. For Texas cases, it was not possible to disaggregate unvaccinated patients from those with unknown vaccination status because the Texas Immunization Registry requires explicit consent by law (i.e., opt-in) to enroll. Among 210 measles patients (excluding 590 cases reported by Texas), 162 (77%) were unvaccinated, six (3%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, 12 (6%) had received 2 doses, and the vaccination status of 30 (14%) was unknown. Among all 800 cases, 790 (99%) occurred among U.S. residents. Overall, 85 (11%) patients were hospitalized; 56 (66%) of those were unvaccinated, one (1%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and the vaccination status of 28 (33%) was unknown. Three measles deaths were reported to CDC; two confirmed in Texas in unvaccinated school-aged children with no known underlying medical conditions, and one confirmed in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. Most cases (557; 70%) were laboratory-confirmed; among 251 (31%) cases from which specimens were available for molecular sequencing, all were confirmed as wild-type virus strain with 225 (90%) identified as genotype D8 and 26 (10%) as genotype B3.\n\n#### FIGURE 1.\n\n![The figure is a map of the United States illustrating the reported number of confirmed measles cases, by state, during January 1–April 17, 2025.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6ba4/12021071/bc9194938090/mm7414a1-F1.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/figure/F1/)\n\nReported number of confirmed [\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN1) measles cases, by state (N = 800) — United States, January 1–April 17, 2025\n\n\\\\* An acute febrile rash illness with laboratory confirmation of measles or a direct epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed measles case.\n\n#### FIGURE 2.\n\n![The figure is a histogram of the number of reported confirmed measles cases in the United States, by week of rash onset and importation status, during January 1–April 17, 2025.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6ba4/12021071/dbb0435b4fb0/mm7414a1-F2.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/figure/F2/)\n\nNumber of reported confirmed [\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN1) measles cases, by week of rash onset and importation status (N = 800) — United States, January 1–April 17, 2025 [†](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN2)\n\n\\\\* An acute febrile rash illness with laboratory confirmation of measles or a direct epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed measles case.\n\n† Data are preliminary as of April 17, 2025.

Fifteen (31%) importations resulted in secondary cases. Among the 48 internationally imported measles cases, 33 (69%) patients were unvaccinated, one (2%) had received 1 dose of MMR vaccine, four (8%) had received 2 doses, and the vaccination status of 10 (21%) patients was unknown. All 33 of the unvaccinated persons with imported measles were age-eligible for vaccination per ACIP, including 10 infant travelers aged 6–11 months. Source countries of the 48 imported measles cases included Canada (10 cases), Vietnam (10), Mexico (seven), Pakistan (three), the Philippines (two), Saudi Arabia (two), and one imported case each from Afghanistan, Australia, Guinea, Netherlands, Somalia, Spain, and Uganda; a source country could not be determined for seven travelers who visited multiple countries during their exposure period: Tanzania and United Arab Emirates (two cases); China, Japan, and Vietnam (one); France, South Korea, and Vietnam (one); Thailand and Vietnam (one); Indonesia and the Philippines (one); and Southeast Asia (one).\n\n### Measles Outbreaks\n\nTen measles outbreaks have been reported in 2025 [¶¶](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN8); 751 (94%) of all reported confirmed measles cases were outbreak-associated. An imported source was identified for seven outbreaks, and the source of three outbreaks remains unknown. Outbreak-related cases have been reported in 12 states (Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas). The largest outbreak began among a close-knit community with low vaccination coverage in Gaines County, Texas in January 2025 and has accounted for 654 (82%) cases reported during 2025 (584 patients in 24 Texas counties, 63 patients in four New Mexico counties, and seven patients in northeastern Oklahoma); the source of this outbreak remains unknown. Thirty-seven confirmed cases in Kansas are suspected to be linked to this outbreak. In addition, an expanding outbreak in Chihuahua, Mexico [\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN9) began in late February after a Mexican resident became infected after reported travel to Gaines County, Texas. All 208 genotyped specimens obtained from measles patients in Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas were genotype D8, 196 (94%) of which had identical N-450 sequences; 12 differed by one nucleotide, which can be expected in prolonged outbreaks.\n\n## Discussion\n\nA total of 800 measles cases and 10 outbreaks were reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025, representing approximately a 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024. Most cases have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.\n\nOverall, 11% of measles patients have been hospitalized, and three deaths have been reported. Similar to previous years ( [_1_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R1)), nearly all (96%) cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, and 77% of cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated when excluding cases reported by Texas. Most (92%) imported cases occurred among U.S. residents returning to the United States while infectious and from all six World Health Organization regions. Adherence to standard measles control measures, including isolation and quarantine, as well as high vaccination coverage locally, prevented secondary transmission from most of these persons who were infectious after returning from travel abroad.\n\nMost cases reported during 2025 have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, resulting in the second largest outbreak in the United States since elimination was declared in 2000. During 2001–2023, approximately 90% of U.S. measles outbreaks with 50 or more cases occurred in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage ( [_8_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R8)). Such communities might have frequent communal gatherings and have concerns about engaging with public health and health care systems for testing, treatment, and vaccination. The United States, Canada, [†††](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN10) and Mexico are all experiencing large, expanding outbreaks in similar interconnected communities. Frequent travel among similar communities across multiple states and countries might facilitate the rapid spread of measles outbreaks. The risk for widespread measles transmission in the United States remains low because of high population immunity resulting from high measles vaccination coverage. However, recent increasing global measles incidence in areas frequently visited by U.S. travelers, coupled with declines in MMR vaccination coverage in many U.S. jurisdictions to <95% (the estimated population-level immunity necessary to prevent measles outbreaks), and spread of measles from ongoing domestic outbreaks to other jurisdictions, have increased the risk for ongoing measles transmission within the United States ( [_8_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R8), [_9_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R9)).\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, imported cases were likely underreported because 30% of reported outbreaks had no known source. Second, outbreak-related cases were likely underreported because certain persons in affected communities might not engage with the health care and public health systems. Third, distinguishing unvaccinated patients from patients with unknown measles vaccination status in Texas was not possible; the Texas Immunization Registry legally requires explicit consent, or opt-in, for adults and by parent or guardian for children to enroll. [§§§](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN11) Persons with no records available are considered to have an unverified vaccination history. Finally, definitive linkages between the large outbreak in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas and cases reported in Kansas could not be identified.\n\n### Implications for Public Health Practice\n\nTo protect against measles and its complications before traveling internationally, all persons aged ≥12 months should have documented receipt of 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine, and infants aged 6–11 months of age should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine ( [_10_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R10)). Persons residing in or traveling domestically to outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance, which is developed based on review and analysis of the local outbreak epidemiology ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). Infants aged <6 months are at high risk for measles complications but are too young to be vaccinated, and therefore depend upon population immunity and passively transferred maternal measles antibodies (from previously vaccinated or infected mothers) to prevent infections and related complications.\n\nHealth care providers continue to serve on the front lines to identify measles cases, alert public health departments [¶¶¶](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN12), ensure recommended testing, and implement measles isolation precautions to prevent health care–associated and community-based transmission. Health care providers should consider measles in the differential diagnosis for all patients (especially those who are unvaccinated) who 1) have fever (temperature ≥101°F \\[≥38.3°C\\]) and a generalized maculopapular rash with cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis, 2) have recently traveled outside the country or to a U.S. region with a known measles outbreak, or 3) have other known or suspected exposure to measles ( [_6_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R6)). Although no specific Food and Drug Administration–approved antiviral therapy for measles exists, rapid access to supportive care can help relieve symptoms and treat complications such as pneumonia and secondary bacterial and viral infections. Providers should also offer and encourage vaccination for eligible patients who lack presumptive evidence of immunity to measles ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R4)).\n\nPublic health departments might benefit from using a CDC checklist [\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#FN13) to help guide their readiness activities such as preparing for laboratory testing and data reporting needs, conducting tabletop exercises, and facilitating early engagement with communities with low vaccination coverage and their trusted messengers before measles and other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks occur. To identify communities at risk, public health departments should consider using both MMR vaccination coverage data from immunization information systems and kindergarten entry and vaccination exemption data from kindergarten entry records. Standard measles control interventions, including vaccination, isolation, quarantine, and postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., administration of MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure for certain persons) ( [_10_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021071/#R10)), might be challenging to implement in certain communities. Therefore, public health departments should consider partnering with trusted community messengers (e.g., clinicians and religious leaders) on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and potentially acceptable community infection control approaches. Coordination with health care facilities, early childhood education facilities and schools, and other congregate settings that surround or serve these communities to prepare for measles cases regarding appropriate infection prevention and control, testing, public health follow-up, and early childhood education or school exclusion policies is crucial to limit transmission. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nMichael Thomas, CDC; Sierrah Haas, Allison Zaldivar, Kansas Department of Health and Environment; Chad Smelser, New Mexico Department of Health; Anna Marie McSpadden, Ashlyn Wayman, Oklahoma State Department of Health.\n\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to [the deaths](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-death-texas-outbreak/) of [two children](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-second-child-death-unvaccinated/).\n\nThe number of cases in Texas alone grew to over [760](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025) before the state declared it [officially over](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-over-health-officials/) in August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,500, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.\n\n[Measles](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-measles-mmr-vaccine-symptoms/) is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause [severe infections](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html#) in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say [the vaccine](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-preventable-symptoms/), which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is [highly safe and effective](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-what-to-know/).\n\nWhile most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.\n\nThe largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well. In South Carolina, for example, [dozens of students were quarantined](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unvaccinated-students-quarantining-measles-south-carolina/) in October due to an outbreak.\n\nThe CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC.
