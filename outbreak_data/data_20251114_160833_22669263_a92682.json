The revised strategy focuses on controlling outbreaks, while expanding vaccination coverage and transitioning toward a longer-term, sustainable response.\n\nMpox is a viral illness that spreads between people, mainly through close contact. It causes painful skin and mucosal lesions, often accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be debilitating and disfiguring.\n\nHistorically a zoonotic disease transmitted from infected animals, mpox has increasingly shown a tendency to spread between people. In 2022, a variant of the virus, clade IIb, began spreading globally through sexual contact. Since late 2023, yet another viral strain, clade Ib, began spreading through sexual networks and within households and through close contact. This prompted Africa CDC to declare a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security and the WHO Director-General to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2024.\n\nBy August 2024, the virus had begun spreading from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 4 neighbouring countries. Since then, 28 countries around the world have reported cases of mpox due to clade Ib. Outside Africa, cases remain largely travel-related. However, within Africa, in addition to transmission in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, local transmission has now been documented in additional countries including the Republic of the Congo, South Africa, South Sudan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.\n\nSince the declaration of the emergency, both regional and global support has increased, particularly for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak. The Africa CDC and WHO Joint Continental Mpox Plan has guided these efforts, focusing on ten key pillars: coordination, risk communication and community engagement, disease surveillance, laboratory capacity, clinical management, infection prevention and control, vaccination, research, logistics, and maintaining essential health services.\n\nVaccination efforts are underway, with more than 650 000 doses administered in 6 countries, 90% of which have been administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Overall, over a million doses have been delivered to 10 countries, with efforts ongoing to secure additional vaccine supplies.\n\nDiagnostic testing capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has grown significantly, driven by the expansion of laboratory infrastructure - from 2 laboratories in late 2023 to 23 laboratories in 12 provinces today. With new, near-point-of-care tests currently being rolled out in the country, capacity is expected to increase even further.\n\nDespite this progress, major challenges remain. Ongoing conflict and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the incidence of mpox remains high, as well as humanitarian aid cuts, continue to limit the public health response and restrict access to essential services. Across countries and partners, over US$ 220 million is needed to fill funding gaps for the mpox response.\n\nThe updated Continental Response Plan calls for intensified efforts to bring outbreaks under control, while also taking concrete actions to integrate mpox into routine health services.\n\nAlong with the Continental Response Plan for Africa, WHO has updated the global strategic plan to curb - and where feasible, to stop - human-to-human transmission of mpox. In the first two months of 2025, 60 countries reported mpox, with the majority of cases and deaths reported from the African continent.  The joint Continental Response Plan is aligned with the global strategy.\n\nAfrica CDC and WHO continue to work closely with national governments, local communities, and partners to curb transmission, control the outbreak, and build longer-term resilience within public health systems.\n\nMedia Contacts\n\nWHO Media Team\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n**Email:** [mediainquiries@who.int](mailto:mediainquiries@who.int?Subject=RE)\n\nRelated\n\n[Mpox Continental Response Plan 2.0 – Africa CDC](https://africacdc.org/download/mpox-continental-response-plan-2-0/)\n\n[Mpox global strategic preparedness and response plan – April 2025](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/mpox-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-april-2025)\n\n[WHO's work on mpox](https://www.who.int/health-topics/mpox)\n\n[Fact sheet on mpox](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mpox)",

The disease presents with symptoms similar to smallpox but with a lesser severity.\n\nMonkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research, hence the name ‘monkeypox.’ The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has subsequently spread to other central and western African countries. There are two known clades of the virus: clade I and clade II. The clade I, which is most frequently reported from countries in central Africa, tends to be more severe than clade II. Cameroon is the only country known to harbour both clades.\n\n## Menu\n\n- [Key Facts](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#keyfacts)\n- [Fact Sheet](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#factsheet)\n- [FAQ](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#faq)\n- [Guidance Documents](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#guidance)\n- [News Updates](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#news)\n- [Media Advisories](https://africacdc.org/mpox/#media)\n\n## Key Facts\n\n#### Recovery\n\nMonkeypox is usually mild, and most people recover within a few weeks\n\n#### Testing\n\nDiagnostic testing to confirm cases involves using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction\n\n#### Vaccines\n\nVaccines developed to protect against smallpox and monkeypox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections and antivirals\n\n#### What\n\nMonkeypox is a rare, viral zoonotic disease that is caused by the monkeypox virus\n\n#### Where\n\nIt occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa\n\n#### Transmission\n\nMonkeypox can spread in humans through close contact, often skin-to-skin contact, with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus such as clothing, bedding, towels\n\n#### Symptoms\n\nSigns and symptoms of monkeypox include fever, rash and swollen lymph nodes\n\n#### Recovery\n\nMonkeypox is usually mild, and most people recover within a few weeks\n\n#### Testing\n\nDiagnostic testing to confirm cases involves using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction\n\n#### Vaccines\n\nVaccines developed to protect against smallpox and monkeypox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections and antivirals\n\n#### What\n\nMonkeypox is a rare, viral zoonotic disease that is caused by the monkeypox virus\n\n#### Where\n\nIt occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and west Africa\n\n#### Transmission\n\nMonkeypox can spread in humans through close contact, often skin-to-skin contact, with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus such as clothing, bedding, towels\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-1-868x1024.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-1.jpg)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-2-868x1024.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet-2.jpg)\n\n### Download the Africa CDC factsheet that explains everything you need to know about Mpox.\n\n[Download](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mpox-SBCC_Factsheet.pdf)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is Mpox?\n\nMpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a rare viral zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It is primarily found in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa and presents with symptoms similar to smallpox, though generally less severe. The virus has two distinct clades: Clade I and Clade II.\n\nWhere is Mpox most commonly found?\n\nMpox occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa. The disease is endemic in these regions, with countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, and Nigeria frequently reporting cases.\n\nHow does Mpox spread?\n\nMpox can spread to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, or with materials contaminated by the virus, such as clothing, bedding, and towels. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct skin-to-skin contact, including intimate or sexual contact, and respiratory droplets during sustained face-to-face interaction. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during birth or through close contact afterward. Transmission from animals to humans can occur through contact with infected blood, bodily fluids, or lesions.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Mpox?\n\nSymptoms of Mpox include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. The rash typically progresses through several stages: macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and finally crusting and desquamation over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Other symptoms can include headache, muscle aches, chills, and exhaustion. The disease is self-limiting, with most people recovering within a few weeks if detected and treated early.\n\nHow severe is Mpox, and who is most at risk?\n\nMpox is usually mild, with most people recovering within a few weeks. However, the severity can vary, with Clade I, found mostly in Central Africa, tending to be more severe than Clade II. Immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are more vulnerable to severe disease.\n\nHow is Mpox diagnosed?\n\nMpox is diagnosed through laboratory testing, specifically using real-time or conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral DNA in samples collected from skin lesions. Proper specimen collection, handling, and storage are crucial for accurate diagnosis.\n\nAre there treatments for Mpox?\n\nThere are currently no specific treatments for Mpox. Care focuses on palliative treatment to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Although not specifically approved for Mpox, antivirals developed for smallpox may offer some benefits, particularly in severe cases or among high-risk individuals.\n\nAre there vaccines available for Mpox?\n\nYes, vaccines are authorized to prevent Mpox virus infections. Vaccination is recommended for close contacts of confirmed cases and for high-risk populations, including healthcare workers and immunocompromised individuals. The vaccines JYNNEOS (Imvamune or Imvanex) and ACAM2000 are available for preventing Mpox infection.\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect I have Mpox?\n\nIf you suspect you have Mpox, seek medical attention immediately. Isolate yourself from others to prevent spreading the virus, and follow public health guidance on managing symptoms and preventing transmission.\n\nHow can Mpox be prevented?\n\nPrevention of Mpox involves:\n\n- **Avoiding close contact** with infected individuals or animals.\n- **Practicing good hygiene,** such as regular handwashing and using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.\n- **Using personal protective equipment (PPE)** in healthcare settings.\n- **Getting vaccinated** if you are at high risk or have been exposed to the virus.\n\nWhat is Africa CDC doing to combat the Mpox outbreak?\n\nAfrica CDC has declared the ongoing Mpox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS). The agency is mobilizing resources, strengthening surveillance, supporting laboratory testing, and providing technical support to African Union Member States to interrupt the transmission of Mpox across the continent. Efforts include event-based and community surveillance, enhancing laboratory capacities, and coordinating the procurement of vaccines.\n\n## Multimedia\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Makumbu-Tresor-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/dr-makumbu-tresor-africa-cdc/ \"Dr. Makumbu Trésor, Africa CDC\")\n\n### [Dr. Makumbu Trésor, Africa CDC](https://africacdc.org/video/dr-makumbu-tresor-africa-cdc/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/africacdc_press_briefing-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/africa-cdc-special-briefing-on-mpox-other-health-emergencies-in-africa/ \"Africa CDC Special Briefing on MPOX & Other Health Emergencies in Africa\")\n\n### [Africa CDC Special Briefing on MPOX & Other Health Emergencies in Africa](https://africacdc.org/video/africa-cdc-special-briefing-on-mpox-other-health-emergencies-in-africa/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/what-is-mpox-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/what-is-mpox/ \"What is Mpox?\")\n\n### [What is Mpox?](https://africacdc.org/video/what-is-mpox/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/symptoms-of-mpox-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/what-are-the-symptoms-of-mpox/ \"What are the symptoms of Mpox?\")\n\n### [What are the symptoms of Mpox?](https://africacdc.org/video/what-are-the-symptoms-of-mpox/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/symptoms-of-mpox-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/how-is-mpox-transmitted/ \"What are the symptoms?\")\n\n### [What are the symptoms?](https://africacdc.org/video/how-is-mpox-transmitted/)\n\n[![](https://africacdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/S.E.-Dr-Jean-Kaseya-1024x576.jpg)](https://africacdc.org/video/s-e-dr-jean-kaseya-directeur-general-africa-cdc/ \"S.E.

Each individual traveled from [areas experiencing clade I monkeypox transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html) and sought medical care for monkeypox symptoms after arriving in the U.S.\n- CDC has [assessed the risk to the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/monkeypox-risk-assessment/index.html) posed by the clade I monkeypox outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa.\n  - The risk to the general population is assessed as low.\n  - The [current risk to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men](https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/monkeypox-risk-assessment/index.html) (MSM) who have more than one sexual partner, and people who have sex with MSM partners, is assessed as low to moderate.\n  - The risk might change as more information becomes available.\n\n### CDC monkeypox prevention recommendations\n\nLearn more about [which activities may put you at increased risk of exposure](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/causes/index.html) when you [travel to a country where clade I MPXV is spreading](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00516.asp).\n\nCDC has updated [prevention and vaccination recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/travel/index.html) for people traveling to countries with clade I outbreaks. **As of September 15, 2025, these countries include** Burundi, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.\n\nIn Central and Eastern Africa\n\n- There are several outbreaks happening at the same time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with cases reported throughout the country, in the capital city of Kinshasa, and in some other large cities.\n- Clade Ia monkeypox cases impacted the western part of DRC. Although most cases have not been laboratory-confirmed, available data indicate that clade Ia monkeypox is spreading through multiple modes of transmission, including contact with infected dead or live wild animals, household contact often involving crowded households, or sexual contact.\n- Clade Ib monkeypox cases impacted the eastern part of DRC; this subclade has driven much of the spread throughout Central and Eastern Africa and has been responsible for many travel-associated cases.\n- Available data indicate that these cases are mostly spreading through intimate or sexual contact between adults at first, then spread likely occurs within households, including to children.\n- The bordering countries of Republic of the Congo (ROC) and Central African Republic (CAR), where clade I monkeypox occurs regularly, are experiencing clade Ia monkeypox outbreaks; some of the cases appear to be linked to spread from DRC.\n- In summer and fall 2024, the disease began spreading to neighboring countries to the east of DRC that are not known to be endemic for the virus that causes monkeypox, and sustained local spread occurred.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/09/Mpox_Africa_Aug2024.png)\n\n![several countries in central and eastern Africa have sustained, local transmission of clade I monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2024/09/Mpox_Africa_Aug2024.png)\n\nCentral and Eastern African countries experiencing sustained clade I monkeypox transmission\n\nCDC has been supporting DRC monkeypox research and response for more than 20 years. CDC and other U.S. government agencies are on the ground in DRC helping partners in the country with disease surveillance, laboratory capacity including testing materials, strengthening workforce capacity, case investigation, case management, infection prevention and control, border health, and risk communication and community engagement. CDC and other U.S. Government agencies worked with DRC to approve and form a strategy for the use of vaccines in-country. Vaccinations for people at higher risk for clade I monkeypox or those who had been exposed to monkeypox began in October 2024.\n\nCDC is working with Ministries of Health and in-country partners across the region on disease surveillance, laboratory capacity including testing materials, strengthening workforce capacity, case investigation, case management, infection prevention and control, border health, and risk communication and community engagement.\n\n### More about US and global monkeypox cases and outbreaks\n\nLearn more about outbreaks of clade I and clade II monkeypox on the [Monkeypox Current Situation](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html) page.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/outbreaks/2023/index.html#)\n\n![CDC staff stand by a table covered in boxes, which contain laboratory testing supplies for monkeypox](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/media/images/2025/02/Rebekah-Tiller_Jennifer-Kasten_donated-reagents.jpeg)\n\nCDC staff in Burundi with donated laboratory supplies to be used for monkeypox testing\n\nCases reported outside Central and Eastern Africa\n\nSeveral countries in other parts of Africa, along with Australia and countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America have confirmed clade I monkeypox cases mostly in travelers who'd recently been in areas with clade I outbreaks. Monkeypox has spread to household or close contacts in only a few cases.\n\nA single person or household with monkeypox is not cause for widespread concern, since public health authorities can quickly identify, isolate, and treat the person or family, and the risk of spread to other people and households can be minimized. Rapid response measures, such as contact tracing and vaccination, can effectively stop disease spread in these situations.\n\nFor data since January 1, 2024, see global data at [2022-24 Monkeypox (Monkeypox) Outbreak: Global Trends (shinyapps.io)](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/#8_Disclaimers). Confirmed cases include those that are laboratory confirmed as monkeypox virus and may include cases only confirmed as orthopoxvirus.

This report describes the characteristics of laboratory-confirmed clade Ib mpox cases in Kenya during the first 7 months of the outbreak. Among 447 suspected cases during July 2024-February 2025, a total of 48 (10.7%) were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing. Most confirmed cases occurred along a highway from the Indian Ocean port in Mombasa to Malaba at the Ugandan border, a transportation corridor that links Kenya to other East and Central African countries. Among the 48 confirmed cases, 27 (56.3%) occurred among persons associated with the transportation corridor, including truck drivers (12; 25.0%), sex workers (eight; 16.7%), and persons employed at or near trucking stopovers (seven; 14.6%). Sexual transmission was suspected in 30 (62.5%) cases, based on the patient's history or locations of the lesions; 11 (22.9%) patients also had HIV infection, one of whom died. Clade Ib MPXV in Kenya appears to be primarily sexually transmitted and concentrated in specific groups at high risk for infection. Public health measures, including vaccination, might be most effective if they focus on these specific groups and geographic areas.\n\n\n[PubMed Disclaimer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disclaimer/)\n\n## Conflict of interest statement\n\nAll authors have completed and submitted the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors form for disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

Three years later, the world is seeing two very different realities: one in Africa, where the virus is surging, and another in the rest of the world, where transmission has slowed but risks remain.\n\n**Africa: A growing public health crisis**\n\nAcross Africa, mpox has become a major epidemic. Between January 2024 and May 2025, 26 African countries reported more than 139,000 suspected cases, including 34,824 confirmed infections and roughly 1,788 deaths. Disturbingly, over 21,000 of these confirmed cases occurred in the first few months of 2025 alone. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone and Malawi are now at the epicenter. (1, 2)\n\nWhat worries researchers most is the rise of a new clade 1a variant carrying APOBEC3 mutations. These mutations may increase the virus’s ability to spread and adapt, raising concerns about whether mpox could become harder to control. Unlike the 2022–2023 outbreak — which was largely driven by clade IIb and linked to sexual networks in non-endemic countries — clade I variants in Africa are spreading more broadly, affecting children, rural communities and health care workers. (3, 4)\n\nWeak health systems, ongoing conflicts and reduced international funding have all hampered early detection and response. Many cases go undiagnosed because diagnostic labs are few and far between. Vaccination efforts remain limited: About 700,000 people have been vaccinated in 11 countries, a fraction of what is needed. (1, 5)\n\n**Outside Africa: A fragile calm**\n\nIn the rest of the world, the picture is calmer but not risk-free. The clade IIb strain that drove the 2022–2023 outbreak continues to circulate at low levels, mostly in specific sexual and social networks. Public health campaigns, targeted vaccination and community engagement have helped bring these numbers down. (3, 4)\n\nHowever, the virus has not disappeared. Since 2023, small numbers of travel-related clade I cases have been reported in the U.K., Thailand, Germany, India, Sweden, the United States and elsewhere. Thankfully, these imported cases have not yet led to sustained community transmission, but they highlight the ongoing risk of spillover from Africa. For this reason, the World Health Organization continues to monitor mpox closely, recognizing that while it is no longer classified as a public health emergency of international concern, the risk of international spread persists. (1, 5, 16)\n\n**Vaccines and treatments: Where we stand**\n\nThe good news is that we are not defenseless. The main vaccine against mpox is the non-replicating Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, known as JYNNEOS in the United States, Imvanex in Europe and Imvamune in Canada. (6) It has also been authorized in Switzerland, Singapore, Nigeria and the DRC. This vaccine has been a cornerstone of both pre-exposure and post-exposure protection during outbreaks.\n\nOlder vaccines, like ACAM2000 — a live, replicating smallpox vaccine — are still available in the U.S. and Canada, but because they can cause more side effects, they are generally used only when safer options are unavailable. Japan continues to use its long-standing LC16 smallpox vaccine. (6)\n\nOn the treatment front, tecovirimat, or TPOXX, remains the leading antiviral option. It is authorized for mpox in the EU, U.K., and Canada, and is available in the United States through an expanded-access program. (7,8) However, recent clinical trial data (STOMP and PALM 007) show that tecovirimat does not consistently shorten the course of illness or relieve symptoms in mild-to-moderate cases, particularly when given late in the disease. Its greatest potential benefit appears to be in early treatment of severe disease, immunocompromised patients or those with extensive lesions. Other antivirals — brincidofovir and cidofovir, both originally developed for other viral infections — are occasionally used off-label in severe or complicated cases, sometimes together with vaccinia immune globulin for added immune support. (9, 10) Despite these options, no drug is yet formally licensed specifically for mpox, meaning that clinical care continues to rely heavily on supportive management: pain control, hydration, nutrition and prevention of secondary infections.\n\nThe pipeline of new tools is expanding. Moderna is developing an mRNA-based mpox vaccine that has shown strong protection in animal studies, and several biotech companies are exploring new antivirals and combination treatments aimed at improving outcomes and preventing drug resistance. (11, 12)\n\n**Preparing for the future**\n\nExperts agree that mpox is a wake-up call for how the world deals with emerging infectious diseases. Strengthening surveillance is essential: This means investing in genomic sequencing, improving diagnostic capacity in low-resource settings and connecting data to global early warning systems.\n\nEquitable access to vaccines and medicines must also be a priority, supported by stockpiles, regional manufacturing hubs and streamlined regulatory approval. Research needs to push forward with broad orthopoxvirus vaccines and better therapeutics. (13, 14)\n\nBeyond the laboratory, community engagement is crucial. Stigma-free education campaigns can encourage people to seek testing and care early. A One Health approach, which links human and animal health surveillance, is vital to prevent the virus from spreading to new animal reservoirs. (14,15)\n\nFinally, countries should regularly test their preparedness with simulation exercises and invest in sustainable financing for outbreak response. Mpox is not gone. The window to act is now — before the next orthopoxvirus crisis catches the world off guard.\n\n_Image: Colorized transmission electron micrograph of mpox virus particles (blue) cultivated and purified from cell culture.
