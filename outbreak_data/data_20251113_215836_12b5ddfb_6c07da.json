When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, [vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit [VaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/data-reporting/).\n\nAt local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage.

States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.\n\nOn this page CDC publishes:\n\n- National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.\n- Demographic and clinical data using the national total.\n- The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.\n- The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.\n\n### Why is there more measles activity?\n\n- Measles was [declared eliminated in the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html). This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:\n- [U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm) has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.\n- [Global measles activity](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/index.html) is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.\n- Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).\n\n**Keep Reading** [History of Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html)\n\n### Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?\n\nCDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\n\n### How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?\n\nMeasles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.\n\nEvery year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Plan for Travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html)\n\n### Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?\n\nTwo doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).\n\n### How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?\n\nCDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html)\n\n### How serious is measles?\n\nMeasles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. [Before the measles vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html) was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Symptoms and Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html)\n\n### How do I protect myself?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, [especially if planning to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/travel/index.html).\n\n**Keep Reading** [Measles Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html)\n\n## History of measles cases\n\nMeasles was [officially eliminated from the United States in 2000](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html), meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.\n\n[View Larger](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)[Download](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n![Line chart of reported measles cases in the United States from 1962–2023](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/Static-map.png)\n\n\\*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.\n\n## Previous years\n\n[Expand All](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#)\n\n### 2024\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported in the U.S. Among these, 269 of the measles cases were reported by 32 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

West Texas saw a measles outbreak this year.\n**Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images** **hide caption**\n\n**toggle caption**\n\n\nJan Sonnenmair/Getty Images\n\n\n\nNearly two months after a deadly, massive measles outbreak in Texas was [declared over,](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak) the highly contagious disease continues to spread across the country. The U.S. has now confirmed [1,596 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest annual number [in more than three decades](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health).\n\nBut the true total could be even higher, says [Dr. Paul Offit](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a), director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\"If you talk to people on the ground, including not only in Texas, but other states, they all say the same thing, which is that the numbers are much worse than that. Probably closer to 5,000 cases,\" Offit says. \"And it's not done.\"\n\nHe points to the current outbreak in South Carolina, where 139 schoolchildren at two schools are now subject to a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The state Department of Public Health on Tuesday [reported its 16th measles](https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-16-total-2025-12-related-upstate) case since July, including 12 cases directly linked to an ongoing outbreak in Spartanburg County.\n\n[![Routine childhood vaccination rates have been dropping across the U.S. and vaccine-preventable childhood diseases have been rising.](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1414x1414+543+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2F92%2F8c8c7286468ab47e022ef7d65d23%2Fgettyimages-1313998982-1.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5188676/trump-election-2024-vaccines-rfk)\n\n### [Shots - Health News](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/)\n\n### [What happens when a vaccine skeptic leads health policy?

She said that makes it vital that the public receive the recommended measles vaccination.\n\nMeanwhile, a large measles outbreak along the border areas of Arizona and southwestern Utah continues to grow, with Utah now [reporting 56 cases](https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/) this year as of Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated. Six people required hospitalization. According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, wastewater testing shows that the measles virus is more widespread in the state than previously known.\n\nIn neighboring Arizona, officials have reported [77 cases](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php) so far this year as of Tuesday — including 14 new cases since last week.\n\nAnd in Minnesota, officials last week reported that a small, recent surge in measles cases there has brought the state's [total for the year to 20](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/stats.html).\n\nAll told, the CDC [has confirmed](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) 44 measles outbreaks in 41 states this year. The agency defines an outbreak as three or more cases that are linked.The vast majority of cases were in people who were unvaccinated; 27% percent have been in children under the age of 5. About 1 in 8 measles cases have resulted in hospitalization.\n\n### Widespread vaccination in the U.S. has saved hundreds of lives each year\n\nMeasles is one of the most [contagious diseases](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread) known to humans. On average, an infected person will infect as many as 18 other unvaccinated people. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left a room. That's why it's so highly transmissible.\n\nBefore widespread vaccination, pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 people in the U.S. used to die from it each year.\n\n[![A person enters a CVS store in Monterey Park, California,  where flu and COVID-19 vaccines are offered. ](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5312x5312+1937+0/resize/100/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fe5%2F0ed7355d4925837197c6108f9630%2Fgettyimages-2237018794.jpg)](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation)\n\n### [Living Better](https://www.npr.org/series/1176326550/living-better)\n\n### [The CDC says people must consult a health professional before COVID shot](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation)\n\nThe disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. To protect communities against outbreaks, they need a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC.\n\nNationwide, measles vaccination rates have been slipping for years — [they're currently at 92.5%](https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html). The trend predates the current administration, but Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, says it doesn't help that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long history of criticizing vaccines. Ratner notes that acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill has suggested breaking up the standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine [into three separate shots](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation), which Ratner says is neither feasible nor is it backed by evidence.\n\nIn a statement to NPR on Tuesday, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, \"Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,\" and wants to ensure that vaccines \"are backed by gold standard science.\" He added, \"Secretary Kennedy has been outspoken in his support for the measles vaccine.\"\n\nKennedy [endorsed the measles vaccine](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury) earlier this year. But senators from both parties have [accused Kennedy of undermining vaccine access and politicizing vaccines](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5528966/rfk-kennedy-hearing-covid-vaccines-cdc) with his approach to vaccine policy.\n\n\"It's no wonder that parents are, you know, confused and frightened,\" says Ratner, the author of _Booster Shots_, a history of the fight against measles and its recent resurgence.\n\nIn some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower than the national average. That's created pockets of opportunity for measles to spread, Ratner says.\n\n\"If a measles case comes into a place with a low vaccination rate, it can really take off,\" Ratner says. \"That's what we saw in Gaines County\" — the epicenter of the Texas outbreak that saw [762 cases and two deaths](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak) — \"and that's what we're seeing in lots of places.\"\n\n- [measles](https://www.npr.org/tags/136620805/measles)\n\n- **Facebook**\n- **Flipboard**\n- **Email**\n\n![NPR Plus logo](https://prod-eks-static-assets.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-plus/npr-plus-combo-logo.svg)\n\n##### Exclusive benefits\n\n###### Give a little.

As of 8 August 2025, a total of 10,139 confirmed measles cases and 18 related deaths have been reported across ten countries, representing a 34-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThe outbreaks are linked primarily to low vaccination coverage, with 71% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals and a further 18% in people whose vaccination status is unknown. In 2024, coverage with the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the region reached 89% (two percentage points higher than in 2023), while the second dose increased from 76% to 79%. However, these levels remain below the 95% recommended to prevent outbreaks.\n\n“Measles is preventable with two doses of a vaccine, which is proven to be very safe and effective. To stop these outbreaks, countries must urgently strengthen routine immunization and conduct targeted vaccination campaigns in high-risk communities,” said Dr. Daniel Salas, Executive Manager of the Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization at PAHO.\n\nCountries with the highest case numbers include Canada (4,548 cases), Mexico (3,911 cases), and the United States (1,356 cases). Other countries reporting confirmed cases are Bolivia (229), Argentina (35), Belize (34), Brazil (17), Paraguay (4), Peru (4), and Costa Rica (1). Paraguay is the latest country to report an outbreak this year. Deaths have been reported in Mexico (14), the United States (3), and Canada (1). In Mexico most deaths have occurred in indigenous people between 1 and 54 years of age. Canada reported a fatal congenital measles infection in a newborn.\n\nThe current outbreaks are associated with two genotypes of the measles virus. One genotype has been identified in outbreaks across eight countries, particularly among Mennonite communities in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Belize, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Given that measles is a highly contagious viral disease, it spreads rapidly among unvaccinated populations, especially children. However, recent data suggests an increasing number of cases outside of these groups.\n\n## Countries highlights\n\n- In **Canada**, national trends shows that transmission is persisting, particularly in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario, following an outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024.\n- In **Mexico**, a mass vaccination campaign targeting people aged 6 months to 49 years is underway in 14 priority municipalities that have active measles transmission in Chihuahua, which accounts for 93% of the country’s cases. Indigenous communities have been hardest hit, with a case-fatality rate 20 times higher than in the general population.\n- The **United States** has reported outbreaks in 41 jurisdictions, mainly among under-vaccinated Mennonite populations, though no new cases have been reported in Texas or New Mexico since late July.\n- In **Bolivia**, most cases are concentrated in Santa Cruz, with additional cases reported in seven other departments, affecting both the general population and Mennonite communities.\n- **Argentina** and **Belize** have seen no new cases since late June.\n- **Brazil** has reported 16 cases in Tocantins, linked to the regional outbreak.\n\n## PAHO response and recommendations\n\nPAHO is providing direct technical cooperation across the region to support surveillance, case investigation, outbreak response, laboratory diagnostics, and vaccination efforts. This includes deploying experts to countries such as Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia; monitoring importation risks in Brazil and Paraguay; strengthening surveillance systems; and working with communities and health workers to counter misinformation and promote vaccine uptake.\n\nThe Organization urges countries to:\n\n- Achieve and sustain high immunization coverage (at least 95% with two doses of measles-containing vaccine),\n- reinforce rapid response systems to contain outbreaks quickly,\n- scale up vaccination strategies from selective approaches (such as ring or mop-up vaccination) to mass campaigns in outbreak and high-risk areas, based on the epidemiological situation and population movement.\n- ensure timely detection and laboratory confirmation of cases,\n- and engage at-risk communities to improve health literacy and address vaccine hesitancy.\n\nPAHO does not recommend travel restrictions but advises travelers to ensure they are vaccinated, especially when visiting areas with active outbreaks. This includes children aged 6 to 11 months, who are not usually covered by routine immunization programs but should receive early protection in outbreak contexts.\n\n## Regional and global context\n\nThe Americas interrupted endemic transmission of measles in 2016, a milestone unique at the global level. Although endemic transmission reappeared in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019, both countries regained their elimination status in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, keeping measles at bay in the Americas remains a challenge, as the virus continues to circulate widely in other parts of the world and vaccine-hesitant groups are spread throughout the region.\n\nGlobally, surveillance data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 239,816 suspected cases and 108,074 confirmed cases in all WHO Regions, as of July 2025. The Eastern Mediterranean Region accounts for the highest share (35%), followed by the African Region (21%) and the European Region (21%).\n\n[News Releases](https://www.paho.org/en/news/news-releases)\n\n[Immunization](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/immunization)\n\n[Measles](https://www.paho.org/en/topics/measles)\n\n[Brasil](https://www.paho.org/pt/brasil)\n\n[Paraguay](https://www.paho.org/es/paraguay)\n\n[Uruguay](https://www.paho.org/es/uruguay)\n\n[Comprehensive Immunization (CIM)](https://www.paho.org/en/comprehensive-immunization-cim)\n\n## Latest news\n\n[![Measles patient](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/measles-patient.jpg?h=ae97dba1&itok=bnGMZyUl)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n[PAHO calls for regional action as the Americas lose measles elimination status](https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status)\n\n10 Nov 2025\n\n[![Arrival of aid to Jamaica](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/emt-aecid-llegada.jpg?h=eed8f32f&itok=Hh60dlMe)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n[PAHO scales up its emergency health response across the Caribbean following Hurricane Melissa](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-scales-its-emergency-health-response-across-caribbean-following-hurricane)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[![Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO, Florika Fink-Hooijer, Director-General of HERA, and European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, who oversees HERA within the European Commission.](https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/styles/4_3_small/public/2025-11/acuerdo-comision-europea.jpg?h=717d0fcf&itok=qG_9hwe-)](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n[PAHO and European Commission’s Health Emergency Authority make deal to boost preparedness for cross-border health threats](https://www.paho.org/en/news/7-11-2025-paho-and-european-commissions-health-emergency-authority-make-deal-boost)\n\n7 Nov 2025\n\n[See all the news](https://www.paho.org/en/news)",

An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same infectious disease linked to a common exposure.\n\nThere has been a rise in measles cases in the Upstate this year, with most concentrated in Spartanburg County.\n\nSome cases are travel-related exposures or close contacts of known cases. Other cases have no identified source, suggesting that measles is circulating in the community and could spread further. We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Measles is highly contagious**:\n  - A person is **contagious four days** **before** **and** **after** **a rash begins**, meaning someone can spread measles before they know they are infected.\n  - The virus can **linger in the air for up to two hours** after an infected person leaves.\n- The measles vaccine (MMR and MMRV) is the best way to protect yourself and others against measles. Use the [DPH Recommendations for Measles Vaccination chart](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/Measles_Outbreak_Vaccine_Recommendations_20251020.pdf) to understand if you need to be vaccinated or not.\n\n## Updates\n\nWe will post measles updates twice a week, at noon on Tuesday and Friday. In time, this update frequency may change to more or less each week depending on disease activity.\n\n### Mobile Health Unit (MHU) Vaccines\n\nIn response to the ongoing measles outbreak, the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) has activated its Mobile Health Unit to deploy to the following locations to offer measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to unvaccinated individuals at no cost. _NOTE: The MMR vaccine is given as a two-dose series and booster doses are generally not needed. DPH also provides information about vaccine services by other providers.

Measles\n\nMost people recover from measles completely on their own. For uncomplicated cases, bed rest, drinking plenty of fluids and over-the-counter medications to reduce the fever and headache may help make infected individuals more comfortable. For those who require hospitalization, supportive care is the only treatment.\n\nDPH’s [measles page](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola \"Measles (Rubeola)\") contains what people need to know about measles (e.g., video, educational materials), and frequently asked questions about symptoms, prevention, vaccination history, and DPH’s role in protecting South Carolina from measles.\n\n### Understanding South Carolina's Vaccination Rates Among School Children\n\nWe still have vulnerable populations, both nationally and in South Carolina. The CDC reports that in 2025: the majority, 97%, of people who got measles were unvaccinated. Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. Travelers with measles continue to bring measles into the U.S. Measles can spread easily when it reaches a community where groups of people are unvaccinated. Based on the 2021 CDC NIS (National Immunization Survey) Child data, coverage rates in the 19- to 35-month-old survey indicate that 88.9% of these aged children in South Carolina have had at least one dose of MMR vaccine. In South Carolina, two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school entry for kindergarten through 12th grade. For the 2023-2024 school year, 92.1% of kindergarten students had two doses of MMR vaccine, down from 95% for the 2019-2020 school year.\n\n- [45-Day Report of Schools with Required Immunization Certification, 2024-2025 School Year](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/45_Day_Report_24-25_20251014.pdf) (pdf)\n- [School Vaccination Coverage and Exemption Data by County](https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and \"School Vaccination Coverage and Exemption Data by County\")\n\n### U.S. Data\n\nFind the latest numbers of confirmed U.S. measles cases.

And in South Carolina, a measles outbreak linked to two schools with low student vaccination rates has grown by 4 cases.\n\nThe total represents the most US infections since 1992, when the CDC reported 2,237 measles cases.\n\n### **Upstate South Carolina outbreak hits 20 cases**\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) said in a press release yesterday there were 4 more confirmed cases in Spartanburg County, raising the state's total number of measles cases [this year to 23](https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-four-23-total-2025-20-now-related \"(opens in a new window)\").\n\nTwenty of the 23 cases, including the 4 most recent, are part of the current Upstate outbreak that is focused in Spartanburg County. Two of the recent patients are close contacts to known cases who have been quarantining at home, and two are associated with a business in Spartanburg with no public exposures.\n\n“Some cases are travel-related exposures or close contacts of known cases. Other cases have no identified source, suggesting that measles is circulating in the community and could spread further,” [DPH said](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/viruses-parasites-bacterial-infections/measles-rubeola/2025 \"(opens in a new window)\"). \"We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\"\n\n> We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\n\nToday and tomorrow, exposed students will return to in-person learning at two schools that were associated with the Upstate outbreak.\n\n### **Southwest has high case count**\n\n[Elsewhere in the country](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/us-records-highest-number-of-measles-since-1992-cdc-says/ \"(opens in a new window)\"), measles activity is still high in Utah and Arizona, with more than 100 cases reported in neighboring counties, including [Mohave County, Arizona,](https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php \"(opens in a new window)\") which has seen 80 cases. Experts say the outbreak, similar to the major West Texas outbreak earlier this year, is rooted in communities with historically low vaccination rates.\n\nOf the 1,618 measles cases in the United States, 87% are part of 43 outbreaks of three or more related cases.\n\n\"For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024, and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated,\" the CDC said.\n\nTwelve percent of cases this year have required hospitalization (198 of 1,618), including 95 children under the age of 5 years.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.\n\nPeople who live in or visit the counties in the outbreak counties listed above should follow the [outbreak vaccination recommendations](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-infographic.pdf).\n\nTo get vaccinated, people can go to their health care provider or a pharmacy. Vaccines are also available through the Texas Vaccines for Children and Adult Safety Net Providers. Use the maps located on the [measles outbreak page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles) to locate a TVFC or ASN provider. Pharmacies can vaccinate people 14 and older without a prescription. Children under 14 need a prescription to get the MMR vaccine at a pharmacy.\n\nAdditional information for the public and health care providers is available at the links below:\n\n[Measles Outbreak page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles)\n\n[Measles FAQ page](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Jan. 30 Announcing Cases in Gaines County](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/state-health-officials-urge-vigilance-additional-measles-cases-are-identified)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Feb. 25 Outbreak Update](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/dshs-provides-update-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS News Release – Feb. 26 Texas Announces First Death in Measles Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS News Release – April 6 Texas Announces Second Death in Measles Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – Feb. 5 Gaines County Outbreak](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – Feb. 24 Measles Exposures in South & Central Texas](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-exposures-central-south-central-texas)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – March 6 Measles Outbreak Case Definition](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-case-definition)\n\n[DSHS Health Alert – April 7 Texas 2025 Measles Outbreak – Expanded Outbreak Counties](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-texas-2025-measles-outbreak-expanded-outbreak-counties)\n\n## Data\n\n[School Coverage](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage)\n\n[Conscientious Exemptions](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions)\n\n[Measles (Rubeola) Data \\| Texas DSHS](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola/measles-rubeola/measles-rubeola-data)\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other 2025 Texas Measles Cases**\n\n| County | Cases |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bell | 1 |\n| Bexar | 1 |\n| Brazoria | 1 |\n| Collin | 3 |\n| Dallas | 1 |\n| Denton | 2 |\n| El Paso | 2 |\n| Fort Bend | 1 |\n| Harris | 5 |\n| Harrison | 1 |\n| Hays | 1 |\n| Midland | 1 |\n| Randall | 2 |\n| Rockwall | 1 |\n| Scurry | 1 |\n| Shackelford | 1 |\n| Tarrant | 4 |\n| Travis | 2 |\n| Williamson | 8 |\n| **Total** | **39** |\n\n2025 Texas Measles Cases Not Associated with the Outbreak in West Texas\n\nCases on this table may be moved to the West Texas outbreak dashboard if further investigation indicates a connection to the outbreak.\n\nSubscribe to our email list\n\nSign up to receive DSHS email and text updates\n\n[Sign up for Updates](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXHHSC/subscriber/new?topic_id=TXHHSC_85 \"\")",

The cases show a significant increase in 2025.](http://composer.publications.aap.org/media/r1kh44ol/measles_091625.jpg?rmode=max&width=1265&height=477)\n\n## Clinical Guidance\n\n- **Presentation:** Consider measles in patients with fever and rash and ask about recent international travel, exposure to international travelers, or exposure to people with measles. Patients may have non-specific symptoms (fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis) without rash in the prodromal phase of infection, so heightened suspicion, particularly during local outbreaks or in patients with recent travel, can be key to timely diagnosis. The incubation period between exposure and initial symptoms is approximately 8-12 days. **For images of rash see the _Red Book_** **chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Measles virus infection can be confirmed by: (1) detection of measles viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); (2) detection of measles virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M; (3) a fourfold increase in measles IgG antibody concentration in paired acute and convalescent serum specimens (collected at least 10 days apart); or (4) isolation of measles virus in cell culture.\n- **Who is at highest risk of acquiring measles infection:**\n\n  - Unvaccinated children or adults\n  - Incompletely vaccinated (<2 doses of MMR) children or adults\n  - Individuals with known exposure to measles or recent travel to areas with active measles transmission.\n\n- **Who is at highest risk of severe measles infection or complications of measles:**\n\n  - Infants and children aged less than 5 years\n  - Adults aged more than 20 years\n  - Pregnant women\n  - People with compromised immune systems, such as from cancer, chemotherapy, or HIV infection\n\n- **Complications:** Measles can cause serious illness, even in previously healthy children. Complications of measles can include:\n\n  - Ear infections\n  - Diarrhea\n  - Pneumonia (either from measles virus itself or from bacterial superinfection)\n  - Encephalitis\n  - Death\n  - In addition, measles infection increases the risk of other severe infections for months or years after measles through the mechanism of immune amnesia.\n\n- **Precautions for patients with suspected or confirmed measles infection**: Airborne precautions are needed whenever there is any suspicion of measles exposure. Promptly isolate, collect specimens, and report patients with suspected measles to public health.\n- **Prevention of measles**: Vaccination is the cornerstone of measles prevention. All children should receive measles vaccination as part of the routine childhood vaccine schedule. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized children should begin catch-up vaccination as soon as possible. During an outbreak, MMR vaccine should be offered to all people with known exposure or in the outbreak community who lack evidence of measles immunity. During a community-wide outbreak that affects infants, MMR vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing symptoms after exposure and may be recommended for infants 6 through 11 months of age. Children who receive their first MMR vaccine prior to 12 months of age will require two additional doses after 12 months of age for full protection. IGIM administered exposed, measles-susceptible people (not previously vaccinated or immunocompromised) will prevent or attenuate infection if administered within 6 days of exposure.\n- **Treatment:** There is no specific antiviral agent for treatment of measles infection. Treatment of children with measles with oral vitamin A decreases measles-related morbidity and mortality. Dosing of vitamin A for treatment of children with measles can be found in the **_Red Book_ chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\n- **Reporting:** Involvement of state and local health departments is often advisable for any suspected diagnosis of measles, as there may be specific ways these departments wish to receive specimens and manage patients.\n- **For more information see the _Red Book_** **chapter on** [**Measles**](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S3_012_002) **.**\n\n## Resources\n\n- _Red Book_ chapters: [International Travel](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S1_006_010) \\| [Immune Globulin Intramuscular (IGIM)](https://doi.org/10.1542/9781610027373-S1_005_002)\n- _Red Book Online_ [webinars](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15686):\n  - [Identifying and Diagnosing Measles in the Pediatric Setting](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/29920)\n  - [The Use of Vitamin A in the Management of Measles](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/31246)\n  - [Infection Prevention & Control for Measles](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/31754)\n  - [Spotting a Threat: Measles in Immunocompromised Children](https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15686)\n- CDC: [Measles (Rubeola)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html)\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| **Pediatric Practice Tools and Info**<br>Watch this CDC video to learn more about the signs and symptoms of measles to quickly diagnose infected patients.
