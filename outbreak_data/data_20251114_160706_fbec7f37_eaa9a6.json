Evaluation and interpretation of measles diagnostic results can be complex, particularly in measles elimination settings.\n\n### Timing of specimen collection\n\nDetection of specific IgM antibodies in a serum specimens collected within the first few days of rash onset can provide presumptive evidence of a current or recent measles virus infection.\n\n### Testing limitations\n\nBecause no assay is 100% specific, serologic testing of non-measles cases using any assay will occasionally produce false positive IgM results. Serologic tests can also result in false-negative results when serum specimens are collected too early with respect to rash onset.\n\nIn countries such as the United States where endemic circulation of measles has been eliminated, most suspected cases are not measles, and rash and fever are more likely due to a number of other rash–causing illnesses such as:\n\n- Parvovirus B19\n- Enteroviruses\n- Human herpesvirus–6 (roseola)\n\nThe presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) can also result in a false positive IgM. Indirect enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) appear to be more affected by RF than IgM capture assays.\n\nPatients with throat or ear infections occasionally develop a rash following administration of antibiotics. Subsequent serologic specimens sent for measles IgM testing may result in a false positive test.\n\n### Evidence of immunity\n\nLaboratory evidence of immunity is based on testing to detect measles IgG.\n\nPeople without presumptive evidence of immunity based on documented MMR doses who have negative or equivocal results for measles IgG should be vaccinated or revaccinated. In some cases, vaccination is not possible, and testing with a second line diagnostic assay may be necessary to determine the patient's immune status.\n\n### Commercial EIAs\n\nCDC has evaluated the performance of several commercial EIAs used to detect measles IgG.[1](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/serology.html#cdcreference_1)Some of the commercial, manually processed EIAs are slightly more sensitive than high-throughput automated IgG test platforms that are typically used by large commercial laboratories.\n\nContact CDC or the state public health laboratory for information on second line assays.\n\n## Instructions for blood collection\n\nBlood for serologic testing of measles at CDC is collected as described in the [Infectious Disease Laboratories Test Directory](https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/list.html) entry for each test, listed below:\n\n- [Measles serology instrucitons (Test CDC-10244)](https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10244)\n- [Measles avidity instructions (Test CDC-10248)](https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10248)\n\n### Testing infants or small children\n\nBlood for serologic testing of infants or small children can be collected by finger/heel stick.\n\nCapillary tubes can be utilized for infants. Capillary tubes require the submitter to have access to a hematocrit centrifuge. Clinical laboratories should have 50 or 100 µL capillary tubes that are typically used for a variety of tests, such as hematocrits or total lipids on newborns. At least 3 of the 50 µL hematocrit capillary tubes should be collected and spun in a hematocrit centrifuge.\n\n## Submitting specimens to CDC\n\n### Contact health department first‎\n\nTo determine where to send specimens for testing, please contact your state or local health department. Specimens can be shipped to the state laboratory, the Vaccine Preventable Diseases Reference Center, or CDC.\n\n[Find contact info](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/index.html)\n\n### Available tests\n\nThe following tests are available for laboratory confirmation of measles:\n\n- A capture IgM EIA (non-quantitative) that incorporates a recombinant measles virus nucleocapsid protein as the antigen is used to detect measles IgM.\n- A commercial, indirect EIA (non-quantitative) assay is used for detection of IgG.\n- Viral detection methods include standard methods of culturing virus in appropriate cell lines and techniques, such as real time RT-PCR to detect measles viral RNA.\n\n**Keep Reading:** [Laboratory Testing for Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/index.html)\n\n### Support from CDC measles laboratory\n\nDuring outbreaks of measles, the CDC measles laboratory can assist with testing for any suspected case of measles.\n\n- **To expedite confirmation** of measles from highly suspicious cases (recent travel, classic measles signs and symptoms)—particularly in a setting with many potential exposures—the following can be sent to CDC while testing is underway at the state public health or local clinical laboratory:\n  - An aliquot of serum\n  - Nasopharyngeal or throat swab\n- **Direct requests** for measles serologic testing that are strictly for rule-out purposes (low index of suspicion, does not meet clinical case definition, no travel or contact with cases) to either:\n\nPrior communication with CDC's Viral Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Branch (VVPDB) regarding suspected cases of measles that require assistance is preferred.\n\n### Specimen submission form\n\nA completed CDC [Specimen Submission Form (50.34)](https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/form.html) must be submitted with each specimen with the following information provided:\n\n- Patient identification number and/or name\n- Patient date of birth\n- Travel history\n- Date(s) of MMR vaccination (if known)\n- Clinical signs and symptoms\n- Date of onset\n- Date of specimen collection\n- Any available preliminary results\n\n### Test turnaround-time for IgG and IgM serology\n\nSerum specimens for measles serologic testing (IgG, IgM) are delivered by courier to the STATT (Specimen Triage and Tracking Team) laboratory at CDC and then delivered to the VVPDB measles lab (Unit #81).\n\nThe turnaround–time for testing specimens for IgM and IgG is 7 working days after the delivery of specimens to the measles reference lab by the STATT laboratory. When situations require immediate notification of a result, please inform the laboratory upon submission of the specimen. Contact Dr. [Stephen Crooke](mailto:qjf9@cdc.gov) 404-718-4003 or Dr. [Paul Rota](mailto:par1@cdc.gov) 404-639-4181. Provide a telephone number, email address, and fax number.\n\n## IgG avidity and PRN assays\n\nIgG avidity testing and a plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) assay are available at CDC. They are used when case classification requires additional methods to confirm measles infection, usually when the result obtained for IgM is suspected of being a false negative or a false positive.[2](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/serology.html#cdcreference_2)\n\nThese assays may be offered when confirmation by RT-PCR was not successful or a molecular specimen was not available.\n\n### Contact information‎\n\nObtain prior approval from the VVPDB laboratory by contacting Dr. Stephen Crooke at 404-718-4003.\n\n[Prefer email?](mailto:qjf9@cdc.gov)\n\nAvidity testing and the PRN assay require specialized reagents and their use is limited to unusual cases, typically in an outbreak setting, when cases with mild or a non-classic presentation of measles are detected. A single serum can be tested for IgG avidity; however, specimens must have detectable IgG.\n\n### Test turnaround-time for IgG avidity\n\nThe turnaround–time for testing specimens for IgG avidity is 30 working days after the delivery of the specimens to the measles reference lab by the STATT laboratory.\n\nBoth an acute and a convalescent phase serum are recommended for PRN testing. There is no established turnaround–time for measles PRN testing.\n\n[Genetic Analysis](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html)\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\n[Sources](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/serology.html#content-sources) [Print](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/serology.html#print) [Share](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/serology.html#share)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fphp%2Flaboratories%2Fserology.html \"Share to Facebook\") [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fphp%2Flaboratories%2Fserology.html&title=Measles%20Serology%20Testing \"Share to LinkedIn\") [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fphp%2Flaboratories%2Fserology.html&text=Measles%20Serology%20Testing \"Share to Twitter\") [Syndicate](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/sharecontent/https://https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/serology.html \"Embed this Page\")\n\nContent Source:\n\n[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/index.html); [Division of Viral Diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/divisions-offices/dvd.html)\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Thomas, DO, a CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer. “For example, syndromic PCR panels to aid in diagnosis of diarrheal illnesses or respiratory viruses are widely used.\n\n“The syndromic PCR panel for skin rash diagnosis that we describe in the report is unique in that it included measles, which is not considered endemic in the U.S.,” Dr. Thomas added. “Additionally, the PCR target used in the panel cannot distinguish between wild-type measles virus, which causes a highly contagious infection, and virus used in measles vaccines, which has no evidence of being transmitted between persons and does not typically cause illness in healthy people.\n\n“Because of this,” Dr. Thomas continued, “it can be difficult to understand whether a positive measles result from this panel reflects a measles infection or recent vaccination.”\n\nThe report found that from May through April 2022, 1.1% of 1,548 syndromic PCR panels collected by a commercial laboratory returned positive test results for measles virus. Fourteen of the 17 individuals who received positive results had available vaccination and case investigation information. Of these, all had received an MMR vaccine a median of 12 days before specimen collection. Additionally, none of the individuals had known risk factors for measles.\n\nAll positive measles results were attributed to the detection of live-attenuated measles virus, which is included in the MMR vaccine.\n\n“We wanted to understand how often the syndromic panels were used, how often they detected measles and the characteristics of persons with tests positive for measles to guide health department actions,” Dr. Thomas said.\n\nThey partnered with the commercial laboratory to understand the frequency of using the tests and how often they detected measles. Then, they worked with state health departments to describe the clinical characteristics, risk factors and vaccine status of those who tested positive, she explained.\n\n“This knowledge \\[that the positive results came from live-attenuated virus\\] provided the basis for developing a process to aid health departments when evaluating persons with positive measles test results from a syndromic PCR panel, and specifically when to consider a positive result as likely attributable to recent receipt of a measles-containing vaccine and when to consider the result as indicative of a measles infection requiring further public health action to reduce spread.”\n\nDr. Thomas noted that if a clinician thinks their patient might have measles immediate public health notification is necessary, and they should not wait for testing results.\n\n“Public health can help facilitate appropriate and timely testing and advise on measures to reduce risk of measles spread,” she said.\n\nDr. Thomas said she hopes future research will address questions that had been raised by the report.\n\nThese, she said, include studying the role of measles testing by syndromic panels, the likelihood of detecting an otherwise unsuspected measles case and querying how much public health work is created by incidental measles detections.\n\n_Dr. Thomas reported no relevant financial disclosures._\n\n#### Related Content\n\n[School Vaccine Mandates Key to Preventing Measles, Other Preventable Diseases](https://www.idse.net/Immunology-Vaccination/Article/04-24/School-Vaccine-Mandates-Key-to-Preventing-Measles-Other-Preventable-Diseases/73472)\n\n![](https://www.idse.net/aimages/2024/IDSE0424_008_13632_blurb_150.jpg)\n\n[Measles Cases Worldwide Almost Doubled in 2023](https://www.idse.net/Immunology-Vaccination/Article/05-24/Measles-Cases-Worldwide-Doubled/73655)\n\n![](https://www.idse.net/aimages/2024/MMRvaccine_thumb.jpg)\n\n[BCHC Calls for Vaccines for Adults Program and Flexible Funding for Outbreaks](https://www.idse.net/Policy-Public-Health/Article/05-24/BCHC-Calls-for-Vaccines-for-Adults-Program-and-Flexible-Funding-for-Outbreaks/73774)\n\n![](https://www.idse.net/aimages/2024/MeaslesOutbreak_thumb.jpg)\n\nRelated Keywords\n\n\n[measles](https://www.idse.net/Tag/measles/3466)\n\nreCAPTCHA\n\nRecaptcha requires verification.\n\nI'm not a robot\n\nreCAPTCHA is changing its terms of service.

We performed rRT-PCR and measles-specific IgM testing on samples from 541 suspected measles cases. Of the 24 IgM-positive and rRT-PCR­–negative cases, 20 were among children who received a measles-containing vaccine within the previous 6 months; most had low IgG relative avidity indexes (RAIs). The other 4 cases were among adults who had an unknown previous measles history, unknown vaccination status, and high RAIs. We detected viral nucleic acid for viruses other than measles in 15 (62.5%) of the 24 cases with discrepant rRT-PCR and IgM test results. Measles vaccination, measles history, and contact history should be considered in suspected measles cases with discrepant rRT-PCR and IgM test results. If in doubt, measles IgG avidity and PCR testing for other febrile exanthematous viruses can help confirm or refute the diagnosis.\n\n**Keywords:** Measles, viruses, vaccine-preventable diseases, IgM testing, IgG avidity, febrile exanthematous viruses, Japan\n\n* * *\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious febrile exanthematous disease caused by the measles virus. The measles virus spreads via airborne and droplet transmission and can cause severe complications, such as pneumonia, acute encephalitis, and sometimes death ( [_1_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R1)). Vaccination with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) is the best way to protect against measles virus infection and achieving and maintaining a high level of immunity in a population can prevent the spread of the virus ( [_2_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R2)).\n\nIn March 2015, the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office verified Japan as a country having achieved measles elimination ( [_3_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R3)). However, although measles frequency has decreased since the achievement of elimination ( [_4_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R4)), outbreaks initiated by measles-susceptible persons traveling to or from measles-endemic countries still occur ( [_5_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R5)– [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R7)). Therefore, enhanced measles surveillance has been ongoing in Japan since achieving elimination status.\n\nSamples from clinically suspected measles cases are required to undergo laboratory testing. Although ELISA detection of specific measles virus IgM in serum is the standard diagnostic method for measles ( [_8_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R8)), detection of measles virus RNA in clinical specimens via real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) is considered the most reliable diagnostic test during the first few days after rash onset ( [_9_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R9)). In Japan, recommendations call for taking 3 specimens (throat swab, and blood and urine samples) from patients with clinically suspected measles and performing rRT-PCR testing to detect measles viral RNA in addition to measles-specific IgM testing ( [_10_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R10)). Samples collected from 3 days before the onset of the fever or rash symptoms to 1 week after the onset of the rash are appropriate for rRT-PCR testing ( [_10_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R10)).\n\nIn Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, no confirmed measles case had been reported since 2014, then a prefecture-wide measles outbreak occurred during March–May 2018 ( [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R7)). Samples were collected from all persons suspected of having measles and were subjected rRT-PCR and IgM testing at the Okinawa Prefectural Institute of Environment and Health (OPIEH). For most cases, laboratory testing confirmed the diagnosis, but for some cases, rRT-PCR and IgM test results were inconsistent, IgM-positive and rRT-PCR–negative results. Because the public health response differs depending on whether measles is confirmed, we conducted additional laboratory testing in conjunction with collecting additional patient epidemiologic information to make an accurate diagnosis of measles in cases with discrepant IgM and rRT-PCR results.\n\n## Material and Methods\n\nAll specimens collected from persons with suspected measles in Okinawa during the 2018 outbreak underwent rRT-PCR testing to confirm the diagnosis. IgM testing was also performed for all cases with serum samples. If the specimen collection period was appropriate, the rRT-PCR–positive result was defined as a confirmed measles case regardless of the measles-specific IgM test result. An rRT-PCR–negative and IgM-negative or IgM-equivocal result was also defined as a non–measles case. For cases with rRT-PCR–negative and IgM-positive results, we could not determine a diagnosis because of the inconsistency of the 2 test results. For those cases, we collected demographic information, including vaccination and exposure histories, to evaluate the test discrepancies. Furthermore, we conducted measles IgG avidity testing by using serum samples and an rRT-PCR or conventional PCR by using throat swab, serum, and urine samples to detect other viruses that cause fever and exanthemata. We chose target viruses that cause febrile exanthematous illnesses and can cause cross-reactions with the measles-specific IgM tests on the basis of reports from previous studies ( [_11_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R11)). Target viruses included rubella virus, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), parvovirus B19 (B19), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human parechovirus (HPeV), enterovirus, and adenovirus. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Okinawa Prefectural Institute of Health and Environment (approval no. 694-2).\n\n### Data Collection\n\nUnder the Infectious Disease Control Law in Japan ( [_12_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R12)), all 6 public health centers in Okinawa Prefecture are required to collect information on suspected measles cases, including demographic characteristics, symptoms, onset date, vaccination history, and outcomes. Those data were sent to the OPIEH and used for the analysis.\n\n### Specimen Collection and Pretreatment\n\nPhysicians collected throat swab, whole blood, and urine samples from persons with suspected measles and local public health center staff delivered samples to the OPIEH under refrigerated conditions. OPIEH performed measles-specific rRT-PCR testing by extracting viral nucleic acid from 140 µL of each specimen by using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, [https://www.qiagen.com](https://www.qiagen.com/)). Staff isolated serum from blood and tested serum for measles-specific IgM and IgG and by using IgG avidity tests.\n\n### Measles-Specific rRT-PCR\n\nWe performed rRT-PCR as reported previously ( [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R7)). We used MVN1139F (5′-TGGCATCTGAACTCGGTATCAC-3′) and MVN1213R (5′-TGTCCTCAGTAGTATGCATTGCAA-3′) primers and an MVNP1163P probe (5′-FAM-CCGAGGATGCAAGGCTTGTTTCAGA-TAMRA-3′) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of measles virus ( [_13_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R13)).\n\n### Measles-Specific IgM\n\nWe tested serum samples for measles-specific IgM by using the Measles IgM-EIA (Denka Seiken, Ltd., [https://denka-seiken.com](https://denka-seiken.com/)), an IgM capture assay. We interpreted test results in accordance with the manufacturer’s definition: positive, >1.2 relative unit (RU); equivocal, 0.8–1.2 RU; and negative, <0.8 RU.\n\n### Measles-Specific IgG and IgG Avidity Tests\n\nWe used the Anti-Measles Virus ELISA (IgG) (EUROIMMUN, [https://www.euroimmun.com](https://www.euroimmun.com/)) to detect measles-specific IgG. We interpreted results in accordance with the manufacturer’s definitions: positive, >275 IU/L; borderline, >200 to <275 IU/L; and negative, <200 IU/L.\n\nWe measured measles-specific IgG avidity by using the Anti-Measles Virus IgG Avidity ELISA Kit (EUROIMMUN). We calculated the relative avidity index (RAI) for each sample according to the manufacturer’s instructions: RAI <40% indicated low avidity antibodies, RAI 40%–60% equivocal, and RAI >60% indicated high avidity antibodies. IgG avidity test results can help distinguish recent primary infection, characterized by a low RAI, from past infection, characterized by a high RAI ( [_14_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R14), [_15_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R15)).\n\n### Febrile Exanthematous Virus Detection\n\nFor rRT-PCR­–negative but IgM-positive samples, we extracted viral nucleic acid and used PCR and rRT-PCR to test for 9 different viruses: rubella virus, HHV-6, HHV-7, B19, EBV, CMV, HPeV, enterovirus, and adenovirus ( [_16_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R16)– [_24_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R24)). Those viruses are known to cause febrile exanthemata and to cross-react with measles-specific IgM ( [_11_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R11)). Previous reports showing that the QIAmp VIral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) effectively isolates viral DNA ( [_25_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R25), [_26_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R26)). Thus, we used that kit to extract viral nucleic acid for detecting DNA and RNA viruses using various primers and probes ( [Appendix](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#SD1) Table 1). We used Ex Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Inc., [http://www.takara-bio.com](http://www.takara-bio.com/)) for PCR testing to detect EBV and CMV under the following conditions: 10 minutes at 95°C, followed by 10 cycles for 30 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at 70–61°C with a 1°C decrease in temperature per cycle, and 1 minute at 72°C, followed by 35 cycles for 30 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at 60°C, and 30 seconds at 60°C. Finally, we performed an additional extension step for 5 minutes at 72°C. We performed the PCR test to detect adenovirus under the following conditions: 3 min at 94°C, followed by 40 cycles for 30 seconds at 94°C, 60 seconds at 50°C, 2 minutes at 72°C, and 5 minutes at 72°C. We performed the rRT-PCR test by using 4 × TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, [https://www.thermofisher.com](https://www.thermofisher.com/)) under the following conditions: 5 minutes at 50°C, 20 seconds at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute at 60°C. We validated the sensitivity of the test by confirming that serially diluted virus-positive control RNA or DNA was detectable up to ≈5–50 copies per reaction. We included a negative control (no viral genome) and a positive control (viral RNA or DNA) in each test.\n\n## Results\n\nWe conducted rRT-PCR testing on samples from 578 persons with suspected measles, of which samples from 541 (93.6%) persons also underwent serologic testing ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#F1)). Of those 541 suspected cases, 93 (17.2%) were diagnosed as measles on the basis of rRT-PCR using specimens collected within 7 days of symptom onset. Among the other 448 (82.8%) specimens, 424 were collected during the appropriate period and were classified as non–measles cases on the basis of rRT-PCR and IgM test results. However, 24 of the 448 rRT-PCR–negative cases tested positive for measles-specific IgM, resulting in discrepant rRT-PCR and IgM test results ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#F1)). For those 24 cases, we collected vaccination history and epidemiologic information, such as history of contact with confirmed cases or viral transmission to others, to support the diagnosis. Furthermore, we performed additional measles IgG, IgG avidity, and detection of other febrile exanthematous viruses to support the diagnoses.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e5b8/11060445/8003dfdad2bd/23-1757-F1.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/figure/F1/)\n\nFlow diagram for analysis of suspected measles cases with discrepant measles-specific IgM and rRT-PCR test results, Japan. AdV, adenovirus; B19, parvovirus B19; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; EV, enterovirus; HHV-6, human herpesvirus 6; HHV-7, human herpesvirus 7; HPeV, human parechovirus; rRT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription PCR; RV, rubella virus; + positive, ­–, negative; +, equivocal.\n\nWe collected characteristics of the 24 patients with discrepant laboratory test results ( [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#T1)). Of those patients, 19 (79.2%) were infants <1 year of age, 1 (4.2%) was child 4 years of age, and 4 (16.7%) were adults >20 years of age. All 20 children had a history of receiving a dose of MCV within 6 months before specimen collection, and 17 (85%) were vaccinated within 60 days before specimen collection. The vaccination histories of the 4 adult patients were unknown. Of note, 12 infants 6–11 months of age received MCV because the Okinawa prefectural government made infants in that age range eligible for MCV vaccination as an emergency response to measles outbreak ( [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R7)). None of the patients with inconsistent test results had epidemiologic links to laboratory-confirmed measles cases. Moreover, we observed no secondary measles cases associated with those cases. Specimens were collected within 10 days after the fever onset, and the median measles-specific IgM result was 2.32 (range 1.23–6.83) RU ( [Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#T2)).\n\n### Table 1.

We used results from those tests to distinguish between a recent primary infection and previous contact with either wild-type measles virus or vaccination as the cause of positive measles-specific IgM results. Among the 20 children, 16 had positive measles-specific IgG results (range 396.7 to >5,000 IU/L). The 4 (cases 1, 2, 5, and 9) children who had negative measles-specific IgG results had their first MCV vaccination within 2 weeks before specimen collection ( [Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#T2)). Although all 4 adult cases had positive measles-specific IgG results, a 45-year-old patient (case 24) had a relatively low IgG titer (518.7 IU/L) compared with the other 3 adults (>4,000 IU/L) who were all in their 20s ( [Table 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#T2)).\n\nAmong the 20 children, 17 had a low RAI, and 3 children (cases 18–20) had equivocal or high RAIs. The median interval from vaccination to specimen collection was 25 (range 4–136) days. The RAIs of the 20 children who had received 1 dose of MCV vaccine correlated with the number of days since vaccination (R2 = 0.6877) and tended to increase over time after vaccination ( [Appendix](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#SD1) Figure 1). All 4 adult cases had high RAIs.\n\nWe detected viral nucleic acid other than measles virus in 15 cases, 13 in children and 2 in adults. Viruses detected from the children’s samples were HHV-6 (n = 8), CMV (n = 7), HPeV (n = 3), and EBV (n = 1). Among the adults, HHV-7 was identified in throat swab samples, and B19 was identified in a throat swab and serum sample. Multiple pathogens were detected in samples from 4 children and 1 adult. We noted no difference in the distribution of measles-specific IgM values between cases with and without viruses other than the measles virus detected (p = 0.318 by Mann–Whitney U test) ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#F2)).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e5b8/11060445/056ee1981198/23-1757-F2.jpg)\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/figure/F2/)\n\nMeasles-specific antibody titers and febrile exanthematous viral gene detection results in an analysis of suspected measles cases with discrepant measles-specific IgM and rRT-PCR test results, Japan.

Thus, accurate diagnosis of measles and continuous surveillance are required to maintain measles elimination status. In Japan, both the rRT-PCR and ELISA measles-specific IgM tests are recommended to confirm measles ( [_27_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R27)). Although rRT-PCR is the most reliable test to diagnose measles, its optimal time for specimen collection is limited to within 7 days after the symptom onset. Furthermore, measles-like symptoms can be caused by other viruses, such as rubella virus, B19, HHV-6, enterovirus, adenovirus, dengue fever, coxsackievirus, and several bacterial and rickettsia diseases ( [_11_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R11), [_28_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R28)). Consequently, unless a patient has had close contact with a confirmed measles case or measles is prevalent in the community, physicians might find it difficult to suspect measles only on the basis of symptoms and specimen collection at the optimal period could easily be missed. Therefore, a measles-specific ELISA IgM test is required to complement the short window for accurate diagnosis by rRT-PCR. The ELISA IgM test has a longer appropriate specimen collection period and is the reference standard for confirmation and surveillance of measles worldwide ( [_8_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R8)).\n\nResults of rRT-PCR and ELISA measles-specific IgM usually agree, but diagnosis can be difficult for discrepant results, especially in cases of rRT-PCR–negative and IgM-positive results. We analyzed samples from 24 patients with suspected measles whose samples previously tested rRT-PCR–negative and IgM-positive during a 2018 outbreak in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. To understand the cause of the discrepancy, we performed 2 additional tests on those patient samples, IgG avidity test and detection of viral nucleic acid other than measles virus.\n\nMeasles-specific IgG avidity test results can provide useful information to distinguish between a recent infection or recent MCV vaccination, which are characterized by a low RAI, and past infection or past MCV vaccination, which are characterized by a high RAI ( [_15_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R15), [_29_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R29)). Among 20 suspected cases in children, 17 had low RAIs and 3 children (cases 18–20) showed equivocal or high RAIs. All 4 adult cases had high RAIs. The cases with low RAIs can be explained by recent MCV vaccination. Our results showed that in children who had received 1 dose of MCV, the RAI was correlated with the number of days after vaccination, consistent with results of a previous study ( [_15_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R15)). Suspected cases in children with equivocal or high RAIs had longer intervals between vaccination and sample collection compared with cases with low RAIs. One of the children (case 20) who had the longest interval between vaccination and sample collection tested positive for HHV-6 in a serum sample. Therefore, false-positive measles IgM could have been related to either an earlier MCV or an HHV-6 infection causing cross-reactivity, and we concluded that a measles infection was highly unlikely.\n\nFour children (cases 1, 2, 5, and 9) had low RAIs and low measles-specific IgG antibody levels (<275 IU/L). All the samples from those cases were collected within 2 weeks after vaccination with MCV, which is before the body had time to produce a robust antibody response. We detected other viral pathogens in some specimens. In those cases, cross-reactivity with other viruses could have caused a false-positive measles IgM result. Although we could not establish the exact cause of the low RAIs with low IgG, those results ruled out a diagnosis of measles.\n\nFour adult cases (cases 21–24) had high IgG titers and high RAIs shortly after the onset of the disease. Those results match previous studies that confirmed measles cases with either vaccination or natural infection show a low or undetectable IgM titer, a high RAI, and a high IgG titer in the early period after illness onset ( [_30_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R30)). Among the 4 adult cases, we detected febrile exanthematous viruses other than measles from the acute phase specimens of 2 cases (cases 21 and 24). The subtle increase of measles IgM titer for those cases was possibly caused by a cross-reaction with other viruses rather than measles infection. Completely ruling out measles on the basis of results of avidity testing and tests for other pathogens is difficult when the measles vaccination and previous measles disease history are unknown. Therefore, when in doubt, clinicians should treat indeterminate cases as positive in terms of the public health response.\n\nVaccine-associated measles cases can be detected using rRT-PCR if symptoms occur within 2 weeks after vaccination and specimens are collected within 7 days from symptom onset ( [_7_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11060445/#R7)). One limitation of this study is that rRT-PCR possibly did not detect the vaccine strain because most children with an elevated measles-specific IgM titer had not received MCV within the past 2 weeks. However, even though the vaccine strain was not detected, taking the RAI result and immunization date information into consideration, we can infer that the symptoms were caused by the vaccine strain. Another limitation of this study is that we only conducted nucleic acid testing for a few viral pathogens that cause febrile exanthemata; thus, the symptoms might have been attributable to other viruses or bacteria that cause similar symptoms. Next-generation sequencing could help to identify the causal pathogen of febrile exanthemata. In addition, results of this study indicate a complete measles diagnosis would require additional testing, such as paired IgG and neutralizing antibody tests. However, collecting convalescent serum samples and conducting neutralizing antibody tests would require more time and would not be suitable when rapid determination of measles cases is needed in an outbreak setting. Therefore, we measured IgG levels as part of the avidity test instead of performing paired IgG testing.\n\nDuring outbreaks, field staff are extremely busy investigating the source of infection and close contacts. Accurately identifying measles cases is vital for a rapid and accurate outbreak response and maintaining measles elimination status in Japan. Therefore, for suspected measles cases, collecting specimens at the appropriate time and collecting accurate vaccination and past infection history are crucial. When a definitive diagnosis still cannot be made, conducting IgG avidity testing and testing for febrile exanthematous pathogens other than measles virus can help clarify the diagnosis.\n\nIn conclusion, 2 diagnostic tests, rRT-PCR and measles-specific IgM, are used in Japan to maintain measles elimination status. Because 2 tests are conducted, test results sometimes differ, making definitive diagnosis difficult. Our results indicate that conducting measles IgG avidity testing and PCR testing for other febrile exanthematous viruses and collecting a detailed history of measles vaccination and measles history can reduce the difficulty of making a final diagnosis in most cases with discrepant rRT-PCR and IgM results.\n\nAppendix\n\nAdditional information on analysis of suspected measles cases with discrepant measles-specific IgM and rRT-PCR test results, Japan.\n\n[23-1757-Techapp-s1.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/instance/11060445/bin/23-1757-Techapp-s1.pdf) (280.7KB, pdf)\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank all staff at public health centers, hospitals, municipality offices, and Okinawa prefectural government office, who vigorously worked to control and end this measles outbreak and contributed to data and specimen collections.\n\nThis work was partly supported by the Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (grant nos.

In the absence of clinical symptoms, a negative measles IgM and positive IgG typically indicate immunity acquired from either prior measles vaccination or past infection with wild-type measles virus. However, the same pattern can also be seen with acute secondary infection in a previously vaccinated person, as measles IgM can be falsely negative especially with commercial IgM assays. Furthermore, if serum testing is obtained after the rash has appeared, an anamnestic IgG response has often occurred, leading to a strongly positive IgG result. The diagnosis of secondary measles can be confirmed by IgG avidity testing. Low IgG avidity is seen with acute primary infection, whereas high IgG avidity is observed with acute secondary measles, with prior infection, or after vaccination.\n\n1.\n\nWhat are the pitfalls of commercially available measles IgM tests?\n\na.\n\nPotential for false negative IgM\n\nb.\n\nPotential for false positive IgM\n\nc.\n\nSlow turnaround times\n\nd.\n\na and b\n\nAnswer: d. Measles IgM testing at commercial reference labs is more convenient to obtain and provides a faster turnaround time than submitting samples to the CDC. Although commercially available IgM tests perform reasonably well in acute primary measles infections, these tests may suffer from higher rates of both false-negative and false-positive IgM results in previously vaccinated individuals than with the CDC assay. The CDC IgM assay was developed at the CDC measles laboratory and is not available outside the public health setting. For attenuated secondary measles cases in particular, it is important to consult with your public health laboratory to obtain optimal testing.\n\n1.\n\nWhat tests should be obtained when acute measles is suspected?\n\na.\n\nMeasles IgM antibody\n\nb.\n\nMeasles RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal or throat swab\n\nc.\n\nMeasles RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal or throat swab and measles IgM and IgG antibodies\n\nd.\n\nMeasles virus culture\n\nAnswer: c. When measles is suspected, an NP or throat swab for measles RT-PCR should be collected when the patient is first seen, as RT-PCR is the more accurate test. Serum for IgM and IgG antibodies should also be obtained. While measles IgM tests are reasonably accurate in acute primary measles cases, false-positive IgM results can occur in uninfected patients, and false-negative IgM results can occur in previously vaccinated patients with acute secondary measles. Thus, submission of samples to a public health laboratory that has specialized RT-PCR and serology assays available, such as the CDC, may be needed for a more accurate diagnosis, especially in previously vaccinated persons. Measles virus isolation is best accomplished using specialized cell cultures, such as the B95a and Vero/hSLAM cell lines, and is not routinely performed outside the public health setting.\n\n•\n\nMeasles is an acute respiratory illness classically characterized by high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots on the buccal mucosae, and a maculopapular rash that spreads from the head and face to the trunk and extremities. Complications include otitis media, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, and encephalitis.\n\n•\n\nMeasles is highly transmissible by the airborne route and from contact with surfaces contaminated with infectious droplets. Upon exposure to a primary measles case, more than 9 in 10 susceptible persons will become infected. In the United States, measles is introduced by returning travelers, and most cases occur in unvaccinated individuals. Previously vaccinated persons may occasionally become infected but generally have a milder attenuated course.\n\n•\n\nWhile primary infection in unvaccinated individuals is characterized by a typical measles clinical syndrome, measles due to secondary vaccine failure often presents with mild or modified symptoms that may mislead clinicians. The absence of obvious epidemiologic risk factors does not exclude the disease.\n\n•\n\nSecondary measles cases present diagnostic challenges, since IgM testing is more often negative by some commercial assays, and IgG results may be strongly positive suggesting past rather than acute infection. Though risk of transmission may be low, obtaining a prompt diagnosis can prevent unnecessary exposures both in the hospital and in the community.\n\n•\n\nTo establish a measles diagnosis, it is essential that an NP or throat swab be collected promptly for RT-PCR as well as a serum sample for IgM and IgG serology. Consultation with the state, regional, or territorial public health laboratory to expedite testing is recommended and to ensure that optimal testing is performed.\n\nSee [https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01938-19](https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01938-19) in this issue for case presentation and discussion.\n\n### Information\n\n#### Published In\n\n![cover image Journal of Clinical Microbiology](https://journals.asm.org/cms/asset/0358e4e9-7fb4-4efd-9f51-bc1355493474/jcm.2020.58.issue-9.cover.gif)\n\nJournal of Clinical Microbiology\n\nVolume 58 • Number 9 • 24 August 2020\n\neLocator: 10.1128/jcm.01939-19\n\nEditor: Carey-Ann D.Burnham, Washington University School of Medicine\n\n#### Copyright\n\n© 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

    "content": "# New Jersey Department of Health Vaccine Preventable Disease Program\n\n# MEASLES LABORATORY TESTING FAQS\n\nDate: March 6, 2025\n\n# SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT\n\n# 1\\. Who should be tested for suspected measles infection?\n\nAny person with clinical features compatible with measles should be tested. As with any disease, lab work should be used in conjunction with clinical presentation (signs and symptoms).\n\n# 2\\. Should I do serologic tests (IgG and IgM) on asymptomatic people to document immunity?\n\nPersons without evidence of immunity and no contraindications to measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine can be vaccinated without testing. Persons without evidence of immunity might be considered for testing for measles-specific IgG antibody, but testing is not needed prior to vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend measles antibody testing after MMR vaccination to verify the patient’s immune response to vaccination if patient has documentation of two apropriately spaced doses of MMR. Documentation of appropriate vaccination supersedes the results of serologic testing.\n\nIgM testing should ONLY be used for patients suspected to have measles.\n\n# 3\\. What specimens should be collected from patients meeting the clinical case definition?\n\nThe CDC recommends that a nasopharyngeal (NP) or throat swab and blood specimens be collected from all patients with clinical features compatible with measles. Urine specimens may also contain virus and, when feasible to do so, collection of both respiratory and urine specimens can increase the likelihood of detecting virus.\n\n# 4\\. What are the preferred specimens for viral isolation of measles?\n\nNP or throat swabs are the preferred specimen for virus isolation or real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) detection. Urine specimens may also contain virus. Urine specimens should only be collected if a NP or throat swab is not able to be collected. At this time, rRTPCR testing on urine is not available at NJDOH PHEL but can be sent to Wadsworth (VPD Reference Laboratory), if necessary. Collect specimens as soon as possible after rash onset.\n\n# 5\\. When is the best time to collect clinical specimens?\n\nAll specimens (NP or throat swabs, urine, and blood) should be collected from patients with clinical features compatible with measles as soon as possible after onset of rash. Depending on the type and timing of initial specimens collected, additional specimens may be requested for testing.\n\nNOTE: please refer to Laboratory Results section for additional information on how vaccination status and timing of collection can affect results.\n\n# 6\\. How long would you be able to detect measles in specimens?\n\nThis depends on the type of specimen and vaccination status of the person. It is recommended that specimens be collected as close to rash onset as possible (but preferably within 3 days):\n\nSwabs may be positive in unvaccinated persons up to 10 days post onset, however among suspected cases that have received 1 or more doses of measles-containing vaccine, virus may be cleared much earlier.\n\nIgM can be positive for up to 1 month in unvaccinated persons. However, vaccinated persons, regardless of timing of collection, may not have detectable IgM.\n\n# 7\\. Should any specimens be collected from a suspected case that is outside the recommended time period for a swab?\n\nYes. Serum can be collected as IgM can remain elevated for up to 1 month in unvaccinated persons. You can also collect serum specimens 2-3 weeks apart to measure acute and convalescent IgG titers, although this might not be helpful in vaccinated persons.\n\n# 8\\. How should specimens be collected and managed?\n\nNP or throat swab: the preferred specimen for rRT-PCR detection. A detailed protocol for NP or throat collection is available on the CDC website.\n\nCollect swab as soon as possible after rash onset. Most successful when specimens are\n\ncollected within 3 days of rash onset; however, clinical specimens should be obtained within 7\n\ndays, and not more than 10 days, after rash onset.\n\nUse synthetic (non-cotton) swabs. These are commercial swab products designed for the\n\ncollection of NP or throat specimens or flocked polyester fiber swabs which are the same type\n\nof swab used for influenza PCR testing.\n\nPlace swabs in $1 { \\\\cdot } 3 \\\\mathsf { m } \\|$ of standard, commercially available viral transport medium (VTM) or\n\nuniversal transport media (UTM). Transport media with charcoal should not be used (e.g., agar\n\ngel media is not acceptable).\n\nKeep specimens cold $( 2 - 8 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ and transport either via same-day courier or overnight shipping for\n\ndelivery within 24 hours of collection.\n\n$\\\\bigcirc$ Ship refrigerated specimens on frozen cold packs to maintain ${ 2 { - } 8 ^ { \\\\circ } } \\\\mathsf C$ .\n\n$\\\\bigcirc$ Specimens being stored longer than 24 hours after collection should be frozen at $\\\\scriptscriptstyle - 7 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf C$ . Specimens frozen at $\\\\mathsf { - 2 0 ^ { \\\\circ } C }$ will be accepted if $\\\\scriptscriptstyle - 7 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf C$ is not available. Ship frozen specimens on dry ice.\n\no Storage temperature must be maintained during specimen transport (via courier or overnight shipping). If not able to maintain frozen temperature during entire transport (i.e. on dry ice), keeping specimen refrigerated $( 2 - 8 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ for up to 72 hours and shipping on frozen cold packs is acceptable.\n\no Avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\n\nMeasles rRT-PCR testing on NP or throat swab is performed by the NJDOH Public Health and Environmental Laboratory (PHEL).\n\n# Serologic testing:\n\nMeasles serologic testing $( \\\\mathsf { I g M } / \\\\mathsf { I g G } )$ is performed by commercial laboratories. Blood should be collected as soon as possible after rash onset. Please see Q11 for additional information regarding requests for additional specimens depending on timing of collection. Collect minimum of $2 \\\\mathsf { m } \\|$ of blood in a red top or serum separator tube (red-speckled or gold). Keep specimens cold $( 2 - 8 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ and ship overnight on frozen cold packs or follow commercial laboratory guidance.\n\nUrine: Urine specimens should only be collected if an NP or throat swab is not able to be collected\n\n• Urine should be collected as soon as possible after rash onset.\n\n• Collect minimum of $5 { \\\\cdot } 1 0 ~ \\\\mathsf { m } \\|$ of urine in a sterile, leakproof container. Keep specimens cold $( 2 - 8 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ and ship overnight on frozen cold packs.\n\nAt this time, rRT-PCR testing on urine is not available at PHEL, but can be sent to Wadsworth (VPD Reference Laboratory) for testing.\n\n# 9\\. Where can specimens be sent for testing?\n\nMeasles serologic testing $( \\\\mathsf { I g M } / \\\\mathsf { I g G } )$ is performed by commercial laboratories. Measles rRT-PCR testing on NP or throat swabs is the preferred testing methodology, and is performed by PHEL. At this time, rRTPCR testing on urine is not available at PHEL but can be sent to Wadsworth (VPD Reference Laboratory), if necessary. Therefore, urine specimens should only be collected if a NP or throat swab is not able to be collected.\n\nWhile PCR testing is available commercially, results will not be received in a timely manner and is not recommended when there is a high index of suspicion.\n\nApproval for measles rRT-PCR testing at PHEL is required by NJDOH prior to submission and should be coordinated through the Local Health Department (LHD). Providers may collect and hold specimens pending approval. Upon approval, the LHD can assist with coordination of transport to PHEL. Each specimen must be clearly labelled with the patient’s name, date of birth, and date of collection.\n\nFor specimens submitted to PHEL:\n\nOnce submission is approved by NJDOH, facility should create an order via PHEL’s Online Ordering Portal: Search for “Measles RT-PCR” as the test order and select specimen type. • Include requisition form in shipment to PHEL. Incorrectly labeled specimens will be rejected.\n\nIf online ordering is not available, a completed SRD-1 form must accompany the specimens sent to PHEL. In “Tests Requested” section of the form, select “Other” and write in “Measles PCR”.\n\n# 10\\. What is the turnaround time for lab results?\n\nMany factors can affect turnaround time. These factors include a) differing turnaround times for tests at laboratories; b) differing test methodologies used; c) timing of specimen collection and\n\ntransportation of specimens to laboratories; d) timing of submission of specimens. For example, some labs have a 1-5 day turnaround for serology and a turnaround of approximately 2 weeks for culture. Turnaround from NJDOH PHEL also depends on collection timing and transportation, but generally takes about 1-2 business days once it arrives at the laboratory.\n\nNote: results from NJDOH PHEL are not intended to guide the patient’s clinical management but are for public health surveillance purposes.\n\n# LABORATORY RESULTS\n\n# 11\\. A specimen tests negative for measles RNA by rRT-PCR or negative for measles virus by isolation. Do these results rule out measles infection?\n\nNot necessarily. These specimens could be negative because the amount of virus shed at the time of specimen collection was very low. Other factors can also significantly reduce the likelihood of detecting measles virus such as inadequate specimen collection, processing, shipping or storage. An example of this is symptomatic persons who have received 1 or more doses of measles-containing vaccine, as they may clear the virus more rapidly.\n\n# 12\\. How do I interpret serology results?\n\nNote: Serologic tests should be interpreted with caution, as false-positive and false-negative results are possible with IgM tests.\n\n# Unvaccinated Persons\n\nA positive IgM test result indicates current/very recent infection or reinfection. As with any lab test, there can be false-positive test results (refer to question 13).\n\nApproximately $23 %$ of serum specimens obtained in the first 72 hours after rash onset in a susceptible individual may give false-negative results. If an acute IgM is collected within 72 hours of rash onset and the ${ \\\\mathsf { I g M } }$ is negative, a second serum should be collected $\\\\geq 7 2$ hours after rash onset if clinically indicated, as a delayed IgM response has been reported.\n\nIgG: IgG alone is not diagnostic unless you obtain both an acute (can be done as soon after onset as the patient is seen, but ideally 4-5 days after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (from 10-30 days after onset) blood specimen for serologic tests to determine if a four-fold rise in IgG antibody titer has occurred (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:320). Although acute and convalescent titers might be useful for clinicians, this test will not help classify cases for timely public health response.\n\n# Vaccinated Persons\n\nMeasles should not be ruled out in someone with negative IgM who is vaccinated if they have symptoms consistent with measles. In addition.\n\nA detailed investigation should be conducted for each case with emphasis on accurate and complete immunization history. Recent outbreaks have included cases who had already received at least 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine.\n\nIn vaccinated persons, the existing IgG will begin to rise soon after exposure and infection. At the time of onset of symptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, which would obviate the 4-fold rise in titer expected when comparing acute and convalescent specimens.\n\n# 13\\. If the suspected case has a positive IgG and negative IgM result, can measles infection be ruled out?\n\nAbsence of a measles IgM response in a vaccinated or previously infected individual presenting with clinically compatible measles does not rule out measles as a diagnosis. A positive IgG result is expected among previously vaccinated persons. Older persons or foreign nationals with no history of measles illness or vaccination may have detectable measles IgG due to a previous subclinical infection.\n\n# 14\\. What can cause a false-positive measles IgM result?\n\nBecause measles is a rare disease in the United States, even with the excellent laboratory tests available, false-positive results for measles IgM will occur. To minimize the problem of false-positive laboratory results, it is important to restrict case investigation and laboratory tests to patients most likely to have measles (i.e., those who meet the clinical case definition, especially if they have risk factors for measles, such as being unvaccinated, recent history of travel abroad, without an alternative explanation for symptoms, for example epi-linked to known parvovirus case) or those with fever and generalized maculopapular rash with strong suspicion of measles. An IgM should never be ordered for asymptomatic persons to assess for immunity, this should be IgG only.\n\nFalse-positive IgM results for measles may be due to the presence of rheumatoid factor in serum specimens. Serum specimens from patients with other rash illness, such as parvovirus B19, rubella, and roseola, have been observed to yield false-positive reactions in some IgM tests for measles. Additionally, when a patient with suspected measles has been recently vaccinated (6-45 days prior to rash onset), neither IgM nor IgG antibody responses can distinguish measles disease from the response to vaccination. In this instance, a viral specimen should be obtained so CDC can attempt to distinguish between vaccine virus and wild-type virus.\n\n15. Is it possible to demonstrate a 4-fold rise in titer between paired serum specimens (acute and convalescent) among cases of measles with a history of 1 or 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine? It may not be possible. In vaccinated persons, the existing IgG will begin to rise soon after exposure and infection. At the time of onset of symptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, and obviate the 4-fold rise observed in convalescent serum specimen. Although acute and convalescent titers might be useful for clinicians, this test will not help classify cases for public health purposes.\n\n# FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\n# Where can I get more information on measles?\n\nYour local health department via Directory of Local Health Departments in New Jersey\n\nNJDOH Communicable Disease Service Measles Website\n\nCenters for Disease Control & Prevention Measles Website\n\nThis information is intended for educational purposes only and is not intended to replace consultation with a health care professional.",
