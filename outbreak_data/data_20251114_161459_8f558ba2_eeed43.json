Canada lost its official measles elimination status this week; the United States could be next.\n\nOn July 7, 2025, the U.S. passed a sobering milestone: the number of measles cases across the country reached its [**highest point in three decades**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000), with 1,281 cases reported — the most since the highly contagious disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. back in 2000. And the year was only half over. As of Nov. 4, that total had risen to [**1,681 confirmed cases**](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html), according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nTo find out where this is heading, look to Canada, which eliminated measles back in 1998. A deadly measles outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024 is still raging, with more than 5,100 cases reported since its start. On Nov. 10, 2025, the Pan American Health Organization, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional office for the Americas, [**revoked Canada's official measles-free status**](https://theconversation.com/canada-loses-its-official-measles-free-status-and-the-us-will-follow-soon-as-vaccination-rates-fall-269090).\n\nWill the U.S. be next?\n\n![U.S. map showing measles cases in 2025. source: Johns Hopkins University](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/cumulative-measles-cases-reported-in-the-united-states-in-2025-%20%282%29.png.webp?itok=KQYAWuct)\n\n## Childhood vaccination rates have been falling worldwide\n\nMeasles elimination is defined as the interruption of endemic measles virus transmission in a specific geographic area for more than 12 months. It's an epidemiological victory — but elimination can only last as long as vaccination rates remain sufficiently high.\n\nA safe and effective measles vaccine has been in use since the 1960s. But vaccine misinformation and vaccine hesitancy are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, and funding cuts are disrupting efforts to reach children with essential immunizations. [**Global childhood immunization rates stalled in 2023**](https://www.unicefusa.org/press/global-childhood-immunization-levels-stalled-2023-leaving-many-without-life-saving-protection), leaving 2.7 million additional children un- or under-vaccinated, compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, according to WHO and UNICEF data tracking immunization trends for vaccination against 14 diseases. Measles cases surged in 2023, infecting an estimated 10.3 million people worldwide, up 22 percent from the year before. That year, 107,500 people lost their lives to measles. The overwhelming majority were children under 5.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Mexico have had sustained measles outbreaks since early 2025, putting them on track to lose their measles-free status in 2026.\n\n_**Related:**_ [_**Americans Who Never Forget: Life Without Vaccines**_](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/americans-who-never-forget-life-without-vaccines)\n\n## As measles cases surge, here are five things to know:\n\n### 1\\. Measles can be deadly.\n\n[**Measles**](https://what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization/measles) kills nearly 300 people every day, approximately 12 people every hour, mostly children under 5. Even when children survive a measles infection, the virus can leave them with long-term health effects or permanent disabilities.\n\nIn some cases, severe complications can include pneumonia, severe diarrhea, blindness and encephalitis (brain swelling). It can also weaken a child’s immune system and make them more vulnerable to other infections long after recovering from measles, a phenomenon known as immunity amnesia.\n\nAny child who is unprotected from measles through immunization is at risk, with malnourished children and those under 5 most at risk.\n\n![Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their ext…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI677988.jpg.webp?itok=UeCEte8e)Norpia, foreground, and her brother Mahajerap inside their home in Cotabato City, Philippines where they live with their extended family. Their cousins were infected with the measles virus during an outbreak in the region. Despite the outbreak, the cousins' parents were hesitant about vaccinating their children. With the guidance and assistance of local health workers and leaders, they realized the importance of vaccines in keeping their children safe, and  decided to allow them to be vaccinated following their recovery from the disease. © UNICEF/U.S. CDC/UNI677988/Amanda VoisardMore\n\n### 2\\. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious airborne disease. It can spread easily as infected people breath, cough or sneeze, releasing virus particles into the air and onto surfaces that can remain infectious for up to two hours. Unfortunately, those infected with the virus can start to spread measles to others even before they know they have it — four days before the characteristic measles rash appears.\n\nOnce a child is infected with measles, 90 percent of those they come into close contact with will become infected, if they are not already immune.\n\nThe measles virus does not recognize borders. Over the past five years, measles outbreaks have hit over 100 countries, including several that had previously eliminated measles altogether.\n\n### 3\\. Vaccines are the best way to stop outbreaks and protect children.\n\nMeasles vaccines are safe. Two doses of a measles-containing vaccine provide 99 percent protection from measles for life. They are the best way to prevent children from contracting measles and spreading the disease to others. No child should risk serious health complications or death by contracting measles.\n\nSince 1974, measles vaccines have saved nearly 94 million lives. They have protected more people than any other vaccine in the [**Essential Program on Immunization**](https://www.unicef.org/blog/legacy-progress-future-promise \"A legacy of progress, a future of promise\").\n\nWhile most countries now include measles vaccines in their immunization schedules, too many children are still unprotected. The story of unvaccinated children is one of inequity, poverty and underserved communities.\n\n![A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on J…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI514454%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=7WEpTkUG)A young girl flashes her vaccination card after she was vaccinated against measles and rubella in Kassala state, Sudan, on Jan. 26, 2024. © UNICEF/UNI514454/Elfatih\n\n### 4\\. Low vaccination coverage is contributing to measles outbreaks.\n\nBecause measles spreads so quickly, maintaining high vaccination rates across communities is critical to preventing outbreaks. Coverage of 95 percent or greater with two doses of measles-containing vaccine is needed to protect communities from measles outbreaks. All children should be vaccinated against measles.\n\nCurrently, the global coverage rate of the first dose of the measles vaccine is 83 percent, and the second dose is just 74 percent, far below the level needed for protection. This leaves room for measles to spread and puts vulnerable groups, including unvaccinated children, at higher risk.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for ending outbreaks and reducing global measles deaths.\n\n### 5\\. A switch to five-dose vials can help governments save more lives.\n\nMeasles vaccines are often purchased in ten-dose vials. Once opened, health workers only have a few hours to administer all ten doses to children. Any unused doses will expire and must be thrown away.\n\nHealth workers can sometimes be hesitant to open a new vial for only one or two children, knowing the rest of the doses will go to waste. This hesitation and fear of wastage too often leads to unopened vials, leaving children without the shots needed to protect them from measles.\n\n**A simple** [**switch from ten-dose to five-dose vials**](https://www.unicef.org/supply/switching-ten-dose-five-dose-vials-may-equal-more-children-vaccinated-measles) **can help increase measles vaccination coverage and reduce wastage.**\n\n![On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Su…](https://www.unicefusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/2025-11/UNI797774.jpg.webp?itok=D5R24uC7)On May 19, 2025, children wait to be vaccinated against measles and rubella at Alwihda health center in Al Jazirah state, Sudan, during a six-day catch-up campaign. “This was the first vaccination campaign since the conflict ended in Al Jazirah,” said Aseel Abbas, a health officer and supervisor of the campaign. “The campaign is important because measles can affect a child’s hearing, vision, movement and development.” © UNICEF/UNI797774/AbdulmajidMore\n\n## **UNICEF’s role in combatting measles**\n\nUNICEF’s mission is to [**reach every single child with lifesaving vaccines**](https://www.unicefusa.org/what-unicef-does/childrens-health/immunization).\n\nEach year, UNICEF delivers around 250 million doses of measles-containing vaccines. These vaccines are essential for protecting childrenagainst measles through routine immunization programs and preventative campaigns in over 90 countries **.** The vaccines are also critical for responding to measles outbreaks, including in conflict and humanitarian settings.\n\nAs the world's largest vaccine buyer, UNICEF leverages its significant purchasing power to secure a reliable and sustainable supply of quality-assured measles-containing vaccines at affordable prices. The measles-containing vaccines are safe and cost-effective in saving children's lives.\n\nUNICEF is part of the [**Measles and Rubella Partnership**](https://measlesrubellapartnership.org/), a private-public partnership including WHO, CDC, United Nations Foundation and American Red Cross that spearheads a global push towards measles and rubella elimination and control.\n\nBy continuing to invest in and prioritize vaccines, we can ensure that no child anywhere dies of an illness we know how to prevent.\n\n_**Your contribution to UNICEF is more important than ever.**_\n\nDonate Button\n\nDONATE\n\n_**Right now, the lives of the most vulnerable children hang in the balance as conflicts and crises jeopardize the care and protection that they deserve.

But UNICEF won't stop working to keep children healthy and safe.\n\nUNICEF works in over 190 countries and territories — more places than any other children's organization. UNICEF has the world's largest humanitarian warehouse and, when disaster strikes, can get supplies almost anywhere within 72 hours. Constantly innovating, always advocating for a better world for children, UNICEF works to ensure that every child can grow up healthy, educated, protected and respected.\n\nWould you like to help give all children the opportunity to reach their full potential?

It also addresses the current debates on immunization and the treatment of measles and presents information on the origins of the various measles vaccines and updates on measles diagnostic testing and molecular genotypes.\n\n## Clinical Presentations and Complications\n\n### Classic Measles Syndrome\n\nBetween 10 and 14 days (range, 7 to 23) after exposure, illness starts with a prodromal phase that includes fever and any of three symptoms — cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (the “three Cs”). The prodromal phase lasts for 2 to 4 days. Koplik spots, small white spots on the buccal mucosa, are pathognomonic for measles but are not always present ( [Figure 1A](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1)). The spots may appear 1 to 2 days before the onset of rash and last for an additional 1 to 2 days after rash onset. A typical measles rash is an erythematous maculopapular exanthem that appears 2 to 4 days after the onset of fever, starting with the face and proceeding to the head, trunk, arms, and legs [Figure 1B](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1). Persons with the infection typically can transmit the virus 4 days before and 4 days after the eruption of the rash ( [Figure 1D](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1)). Diarrhea can appear early in the acute phase and may last for a month.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) Prodromal symptoms, rash, and diarrhea in any child should arouse suspicion for measles infection.\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/a3e5d59c-887d-4205-b19a-01e7b3fabdd4/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_f1.jpg)\n\nClinical Features and Pathogenesis of Measles.\n\nFeatures of measles include Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa (Panel A); rash on the trunk, spreading to the face, head, arms, and legs (Panel B); and conjunctivitis (Panel C). Day 0 denotes the day the measles rash appears; Day −4 is the probable start of infectiousness, Day 4 is the probable end of infectiousness, and Day −23 is the earliest possible exposure day (Panel D). CD150+ lymphocytes are T and B memory lymphocytes targeted by the measles virus. 3 Cs denotes cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, and MeV measles virus. Images in Panels A, B, and C were provided by Du Tuan Quy, M.D., with the approval of Le Nguyen Thanh Nhan, M.D., Ph.D., Children’s Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\n\n#### Measles 2025\n\n•\n\nMeasles causes a range of serious health issues, including immune amnesia that may last up to 1 year in fully recovered patients and increased susceptibility to sometimes severe secondary infections. Research on restoring immunity more rapidly is needed.\n\n•\n\nMeasles vaccine has a long safety history and is highly effective against all circulating measles genotypes.\n\n•\n\nMeasles is highly contagious; therefore, a high coverage level (>95%) of both recommended doses of measles vaccine is necessary to prevent community transmission.\n\n•\n\nVitamin A supplementation is recommended for all persons who have measles to reduce complications and the risk of death, particularly in persons who have deficient levels of vitamin A, such as persons living in low- and middle-income countries. Vitamin A does not prevent measles infection. More data are needed regarding the benefits of vitamin A in persons living in developed countries who have measles.\n\n•\n\nWaning levels of maternal measles antibodies at 3 to 4 months of age has increased measles risk in young infants. Further research on the effectiveness of early measles vaccination is needed.\n\n•\n\nAdditional randomized, controlled trials are needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of vaccine microneedle patches, which may help to increase vaccination coverage.\n\nBecause measles is a systemic infection, it can affect the skin, eyes, gut, and respiratory system. Complications that occur in approximately 30% of measles cases[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) — and frequently occur up to 1 month after infection — include diarrhea, pneumonia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis ( [Table 1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t1) and [Figure 1C](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f1)).[5-14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) Pneumonitis and giant-cell pneumonia are rare but severe and potentially fatal complications of measles. These conditions are reported mainly in persons who are immunosuppressed and in young children.\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/5fc57d63-5308-4630-9801-53c070590258/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_t1.jpg)\n\n| Complications | Incidence in<br>Developed Countries | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pneumonia | 1–6 per 100 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | Among the most common complications during the first month of measles; most common cause of measles hospitalization |\n| Diarrhea | 8–10 per 100 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | Common complication during the first month of measles |\n| Keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis | 3–10 per 100 measles cases [6-9](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r6) | Keratoconjunctivitis may appear in the prodromal stages of measles and persist for as long as 3 months[6](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r6); keratitis with retinitis and optic neuritis also has been reported.[7-9](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r7) |\n| Corneal ulceration | Rare | Documented in 1–4 per 100 measles cases in the 1980s in Africa and South Asia[10,11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r10); measles can cause corneal ulceration directly and facilitate a secondary infection (such as herpes simplex keratitis) that leads to corneal ulceration[10,11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r10) |\n| Blindness | Rare | Measles is a leading cause of childhood blindness in places where measles is endemic; results of surveys conducted in schools in Africa in the 1970s suggested that measles was the cause of 33 to 79% cases of blindness.[11](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r11) |\n| Otitis media | 7–9 per 100 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | One of the most common complications during the first month of measles; can lead to sensorineural deafness, which was observed in 5 to 10% of measles cases in the United States before the introduction of measles vaccination programs[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) |\n| Death | 1–3 per 1000 measles cases[5](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | 16 per 1000 measles cases in low-income countries[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r12); 9 per 1000 measles cases in middle-income countries[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r12); up to 180 per 1000 measles cases reported in the context of humanitarian relief efforts during major outbreaks[13](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r13) |\n| Malnutrition | 8–10 per 100 measles cases |  |\n| Acute postinfectious measles encephalitis | 1 per 1000 measles cases[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) | Develops within the first week of measles, after the appearance of the first symptoms, and is associated with 20% mortality[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) |\n| Measles-inclusion body encephalitis | 1 per 1000 measles cases[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) | Develops within 7 days to 6 months after onset of measles and is associated with 100% mortality[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14) |\n| Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis | 7–11 per 100,000 measles cases[5,14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r5) | Develops within 7–10 years after measles and is associated with 100% mortality within 1–3 years after onset[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14); young children with measles (<2 years of age) are at increased risk |\n\nIncidence of Severe Complications Associated with Measles.\n\nEven after recovery, children who have had measles are at high risk for late complications such as pneumonia, malnutrition, and blindness. Blindness is usually due to severe corneal ulceration, and sometimes corneal perforation, in children who are deficient in vitamin A.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) Temporary immune amnesia caused by depletion of B-cell and T-cell memory by the measles virus has recently been shown to be a mechanism for longer-term susceptibility to secondary infections in persons who have had measles (see the [Supplementary Appendix](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Children recovering from measles are at elevated relative risk for serious secondary infection, particularly pneumonia. Even in a high-resource area of Germany, the risk of pneumonia among children with measles was elevated as compared with that among children who had noninfectious diseases (risk ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.4 to 2.0).[15](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r15) In low- and middle-income countries, the risk is greater than in countries with higher incomes, and measles is associated with substantial mortality.[16](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r16)\n\nMeasles-associated encephalitis is a rare but serious, and potentially fatal, complication. It can occur during the first 7 days of infection (acute postinfectious measles encephalitis), 1 to 6 months after infection (measles-inclusion body encephalitis), or even years after full recovery (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14)\n\n### Atypical Measles Syndrome\n\nAtypical measles syndrome was first reported in the 1960s among children who received the inactivated (killed) measles vaccine that was in use during the period 1963–1967. After these children were exposed to measles virus in the community, they became ill with a severe form of measles disease marked by high fever, an unusual type of rash (a petechial or morbilliform rash that began on the arms and legs), and severe pneumonia.[17](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r17) This atypical measles syndrome has been reported rarely since the inactivated measles vaccine was withdrawn in 1967.[14](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r14)\n\n### Modified Measles Syndrome\n\nMeasles can occur in persons who are fully vaccinated (i.e., have received two doses) or who are undervaccinated. These breakthrough infections can result from primary vaccine failure, lack of seroconversion after immunization, or secondary vaccine failure due to waning of the measles-antibody level (waning immunity), which can occur 6 or more years after vaccination.[18](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r18)\n\nPersons with primary vaccine failure may have the classic measles syndrome, but persons with secondary vaccine failure tend to have milder symptoms — often only a rash with little or no fever, nonspecific respiratory symptoms, and a lower viral load. Persons with secondary vaccine failure are at lower risk for transmission than unvaccinated persons who have measles infection.[18](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r18)\n\n### Measles in Special Populations\n\nWhen measles outbreaks occur, persons with compromised immunity, such as malnourished children, immunocompromised persons (e.g., persons who have human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\] or are receiving cancer treatment), and pregnant persons are particularly vulnerable. Persons with HIV who are not immune to measles are at increased risk for more severe measles infection with pneumonia or encephalitis.\n\nIn a series of 23 pediatric cancer patients in China who had measles infection, 5 underwent ventilation, 1 had liver failure, and 4 died. These outcomes occurred even though 20 of the 23 patients had been vaccinated (including the 4 who died) and 21 had been treated with intravenous immune globulin.[19](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r19)\n\nMalnutrition and measles have a historical link, particularly in the context of humanitarian relief efforts. The bidirectional relationship between measles and malnutrition was described decades ago.[20](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r20) Malnutrition is a primary contributor to death in 45% of fatal measles cases.[21](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r21) Measles is worse in children who are already malnourished, and postmeasles effects can lead to malnutrition in children who were not malnourished before they were infected with measles.[13](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r13) Measles can lead to or exacerbate vitamin A deficiency[22](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r22) or a persistent nutritional deficit.[23](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r23) Malnourished children have a poor response to measles vaccine and other vaccines.[24,25](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r24)\n\nAlthough measles virus is not teratogenic, measles in pregnant persons can lead to fetal loss, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature delivery.[26](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r26) The case fatality rate among pregnant persons with measles can range from 5% in areas where measles is endemic, such as in Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa, to 20 to 30% among fragile populations, such as refugee populations.[27](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r27) Preterm birth is reported as the most frequent fetal complication.[26](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r26)\n\n## Current Recommendations\n\n### Current Global Pediatric Measles Vaccination Policy\n\nMeasles vaccine has a long history. Various attenuated measles vaccine strains were developed and are in active use worldwide (see the [Supplementary Appendix](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap1)) either as a monovalent vaccine or combined with mumps and rubella vaccines, with or without varicella vaccine.\n\nThe recommended age for the first dose of measles-containing vaccine depends on the waning of maternal antibodies in the patient and the risk of measles exposure.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) In countries where measles is in elimination status (i.e., continuous transmission has been absent for more than 12 months), the first dose may be given at 12 to 18 months of age for maximum immunogenicity, although this schedule leaves most infants in the country susceptible to infection. In countries where measles is endemic — mainly low- and middle-income countries — the first dose of measles vaccine is usually given at 9 months of age. China and South Africa are exceptions, with the routine first dose given at 8 months and 6 months of age, respectively.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r2) Given that 10 to 15% of infants who receive the first dose at 9 months of age do not have seroconversion and to ensure protection for children who either do not have a response to the first dose or miss the first dose entirely, the WHO recommends a second dose for all children globally.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) The recommended shortest time between the two doses is 4 weeks. The timing of the first and second doses of measles vaccine in each country depends on the epidemiologic context and the recommendations of the immunization program of the country. The WHO also recommends an additional dose for infants 6 to 11 months of age during measles outbreaks in regions where measles is endemic.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4)\n\nIn the United States, the first dose is given at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years. Infants 6 to 11 months of age may also be given an additional dose in regions where there are outbreaks or before international travel ( [Table 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2)).[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28)\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/e68e9ebb-772d-401e-9e60-19a351da1c99/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_t2.jpg)\n\n| Recommendation | Schedule and Dose |\n| --- | --- |\n| Preschool children |  |\n| Routine childhood schedule | Two-dose schedule — First dose at 12 to 15 months of age (MMR vaccine), second dose at 4 to 6 years of age (MMR-V vaccine) |\n| In outbreak locations or before international travel | Additional dose is given as early as 6 months of age to all children younger than 12 months of age; routine two-dose schedule is still recommended, but earlier second dose is recommended [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) |\n| Healthy adults | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity; no booster program for those with evidence of previous vaccination on two-dose schedule [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Special populations |  |\n| Health care workers born before 1957 | One or two doses of measles vaccine unless evidence of immunity [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Health care workers born in 1957 or later | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Received measles vaccine between 1967 and 1989 | One or two doses of measles vaccine unless evidence of immunity [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| ≥12 mo of age with HIV infection | Two-dose schedule: first dose at 12 months of age (MMR vaccine), second dose can be earlier than routine (at 13 months of age; MMR vaccine) [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [§](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn4) |\n| International travelers | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n| Family carers of immunocompromised patients | Two-dose schedule unless evidence of immunity [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn2) [‡](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn3) |\n\nSummary of Current Measles Vaccination Recommendations in the United States. [\\*](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t2fn1)\n\n\\*\n\nAdapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, available at [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html). HIV denotes human immunodeficiency virus, MMR measles–mumps–rubella, and MMR-V measles–mumps–rubella–varicella.\n\n†\n\nA 28-day period between the doses is recommended.\n\n‡\n\nEvidence of immunity includes written documentation of one or more doses of measles vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not considered high risk; written documentation of two doses of measles vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk, including students at post–high school secondary educational institutions, health care personnel, and international travelers; laboratory evidence of immunity; laboratory confirmation of disease; and birth before 1957 (except in health care workers born before 1957, for whom the evidence of immunity is laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease).\n\n§\n\nMMR vaccine is indicated only in the absence of severe immunosuppression, which is defined as a CD4 percentage of less than 15% for at least 6 months in persons 5 years of age or younger and a CD4 percentage of less than 15% and CD4 count of less than 200 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter for at least 6 months for persons 5 years of age or older. MMR-V is contraindicated in persons with HIV infection; only MMR vaccine is approved for use in such patients.\n\nBecause the measles virus has a high reproduction number, high coverage of both doses of measles vaccine (≥95%) at the population level is required to maintain effective herd immunity against measles transmission.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) In reality, this goal is a very difficult one to attain for most countries owing to growing global vaccine hesitancy and other challenges, such as financial barriers, poor access to health care, and inappropriate contraindications in certain cases. Even when high vaccination coverage is achieved, small, poorly vaccinated communities may still have outbreaks.[30,31](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r30)\n\n### Postexposure Prophylaxis\n\nIn unvaccinated or undervaccinated persons, measles vaccine is recommended within 72 hours after exposure. When there are contraindications to the measles vaccine, such as in immunocompromised or pregnant persons or infants younger than 6 months of age, human immune globulin is recommended to be given within 6 days after exposure.[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4)\n\nRecommendations for postexposure prophylaxis and the availability of immune globulin products vary among countries.[32](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r32) In many low- and middle-income countries, access to immune globulin is very limited owing to its high cost and low availability.\n\nA recent meta-analysis showed that the estimated effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of measles ranged from 76% (95% CI, 0 to 94) to 100% (95% CI, 56 to 100) with immune globulin and from 83% (95% CI, 34 to 96) to 100% (95% CI, not evaluable) with the measles vaccine.[33](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r33) Postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulin offers greater short-term protection than postexposure prophylaxis with the measles vaccine but at greater cost and use of resources.\n\nThe effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis may be affected by the concentration of measles antibodies in immune globulin products,[34](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r34) the nature and intensity of measles exposure events, and the timing of postexposure prophylaxis.[35](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r35) The timing of postexposure prophylaxis reported in the studies included in the meta-analysis was recommended mainly on the basis of the duration of measles incubation; there are very limited data on the effect of delayed postexposure prophylaxis.[33,36](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r33)\n\nBecause levels of measles antibodies in the immune globulin donor population have decreased over time,[37](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r37) measles antibody concentration in immune globulin products is also decreasing. This change highlights the need for periodic review of the recommended dose.[38,39](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r38) Although the correlates of protection for measles have been recently debated,[40](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r40) the previously published threshold (i.e., >120 mIU per milliliter) has been widely accepted and used as the target serum concentration for measles antibodies after postexposure passive immunization, thereby guiding the recommended dose.[38,39](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r38)\n\n### Management of Measles\n\nThere is no approved antiviral medication for measles. Management of measles infection involves early detection and treatment of complications as well as patient isolation to prevent nosocomial and community transmission.\n\nVitamin A deficiency has been associated with measles severity and mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries. In large-scale, community-based, randomized trials in many Asian and African countries between 1983 and 1992, administration of vitamin A reduced measles mortality by 34 to 50% among children 1 to 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) Vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol level, <10 μg per deciliter) is a major public health issue affecting preschool-age children in low- and middle-income countries.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) Since 1993, the WHO has recommended vitamin A, with specific doses according to age groups, to all persons who have acute measles infection, irrespective of the timing of previous doses of vitamin A ( [Table 3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3)).[4](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) This recommendation is based on data from studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries,[43](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r43) and there has been no report of toxic effects from vitamin A in patients with measles who have received vitamin A according to WHO recommendations.[41,43](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) The benefit of routine vitamin A supplementation outside of treating measles or other specific diseases remains debated, particularly when the vitamin A–deficiency status is unknown.[44](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r44) In addition, routine vitamin A supplementation in excess of the recommended dietary allowance can cause acute and chronic toxic effects in well-nourished children and adults.[45](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r45) Children are particularly sensitive; daily intakes of more than 1500 IU per kilogram of body weight have been associated with toxic effects in children.[45](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r45)\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/a7a95bfd-40b8-48b8-940b-2823bbd014de/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_t3.jpg)\n\n| Age Group | Dose | Frequency |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Children |  |  |\n| <6 mo | 50,000 IU (15,000 μg RAE) | Daily for 2 days |\n| 6–11 mo | 100,000 IU (30,000 μg RAE) | Daily for 2 days |\n| >12 mo | 200,000 IU (60,000 μg RAE) | Daily for 2 days |\n| Previous vitamin A deficiency or eye complications caused by measles | Third dose | 2–4 wk after the second dose |\n| Adults [†](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3fn2) | No recommendation | No recommendation |\n\nU.S. Recommendations for Vitamin A Supplementation in Patients with Measles.

Women of reproductive age should receive only lower, but more frequent, doses of vitamin A (e.g., a daily oral dose of 5000 to 10,000 IU of vitamin A for at least 4 weeks) owing to possible teratogenic effects.\n\nIn the only known study of the use of vitamin A in measles management in the United States, only 39% of patients received vitamin A and received a much lower dose than that recommended by the WHO.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) In contrast, recent cases of toxic effects of vitamin A intake associated with measles outbreaks in the United States (notably in West Texas) were linked to excessive or unsupervised intake of vitamin A outside medical guidance owing to misinformation. These data point to a need for clarity regarding vitamin A supplementation in the treatment of measles to inform health care workers and the public in the United States.\n\nData are limited regarding the benefit of vitamin A in the context of the United States, where vitamin A deficiency is rare. Measles depresses serum levels of vitamin A in well-nourished children to below the levels observed in malnourished children without measles.[46](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r46) In the United States, hospitalized children with measles frequently have low serum vitamin A levels, correlating with measles severity.[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) Because vitamin A is critical in enhancing immune responses against infections,[41](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r41) supplementation with vitamin A is recommended in children with measles. A meeting on the subject led by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases in November 2019 provided suggestions on vitamin A doses ( [Table 3](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#t3)).\n\n## Current Measles Epidemiologic Background\n\n### Immunity Gaps in Young Infants and Early Measles Vaccination\n\nRecent data have shown that the rate of decline of maternal antibodies has increased over time both in regions where measles is endemic and in areas where measles has been eliminated.[47,48](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r47) In Canada in the period 2014–2016, more than 90% of 3-month-old infants had levels of maternal measles antibodies that were lower than a threshold neutralization titer of 192 mIU per milliliter.[49](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r49) A recent multicountry modeling exercise predicted 70.8%, 88.3%, and 100% of infants would be seronegative by 2, 4, and 6 months of age, respectively.[50](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r50) A meta-analysis of data from low- and middle-income countries (2018–2024) showed that by 4 months of age, only 24 to 35% of children remained seropositive.[51](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r51) Clearly, many unvaccinated young infants in regions of measles outbreaks are at high risk for acquiring measles.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, more than 90% of the measles cases worldwide were among children in low- and middle-income countries.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) Most of those infected were children younger than 5 years of age, with the highest mortality among those younger than 1 year.[12](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r12) No systematic analysis has been conducted over the past decade to confirm the observed trend of increasing proportions of measles cases and deaths among young infants. Vietnam, which was among the top 10 countries in terms of number of measles cases in March 2025, had reported a rising number of cases among children 6 to 8 months of age; that age group represented 25% of measles cases in some areas.[52](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r52) Young infants are at heightened risk for severe measles-related complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death.[53,54](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r53) Children in this group are also at increased risk for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare but fatal condition.[55,56](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r55)\n\nIn recognition of the potential vulnerability of young infants, discussions on the timing of the first dose of measles vaccine have been under way for decades and more recently at the WHO.[4,57–60](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r4) An early dose of measles vaccine given at 3 to 4 months of age could provide protection throughout infancy. Three studies conducted more than a decade ago provided some data regarding the safety, efficacy, and potential blunting effect (i.e., reducing the immunogenicity, both short term and long term, of subsequent doses) of an early dose of measles vaccine given at 4 to 4.5 months of age.[61-63](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r61) This dose could be either the early administration of the first recommended dose of the vaccine or an additional dose to the current two-dose schedule.[61-63](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r61) Both approaches have shown acceptable safety and immunogenicity.[61,62](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r61) The first dose, when given at 4.5 months of age, provided 94% efficacy against measles infection and 100% efficacy against hospitalization for measles.[62](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r62) Determining the appropriate timing of an early dose requires a balance between the age-stratified infection risk (the age at which maternal antibodies would no longer inhibit measles vaccine immunogenicity) and the duration of vaccine effectiveness over time.[57,58](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r57) A trade-off of administering an early dose is the reportedly more rapid reduction of measles antibody in children who are vaccinated early in infancy.[64,65](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r64) Whether this antibody reduction would translate to reduced vaccine efficacy in later childhood is still an open question.\n\n### Immunity Gaps in Adults and Booster Dose\n\nBecause the two-dose measles vaccine schedule was not introduced in the United States until 1989, persons who received the vaccine between 1967 and 1989 may consider receiving a second dose if they are in a high-risk group, such as health care workers or international travelers.[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28) An extra dose of measles vaccine may be also considered in persons who received the vaccine between 1963 and 1967, because the inactivated (killed) vaccine that was used was less effective than the current live attenuated vaccine.[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28) Of note, persons who received measles vaccine between 1967 and 1989 or who received the inactivated measles vaccine may have immunity that is “boosted” over time by natural measles exposure, because measles was still endemic in the United States until 2000.\n\nAmong persons born before 1957 (before the first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963), natural measles immunity is even more certain because measles cases were common until that time. However, measles vaccine should still be considered in health care workers who do not have laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. Currently, there is no recommended routine catch-up vaccination program for adults in the United States.[28](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r28)\n\nThe primary cause of the resurgence in measles cases is failure to vaccinate, not failure of the vaccine. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the WHO recommend routine boosters in persons who are fully vaccinated. Studies regarding serologic events conducted in the past 5 years in areas where measles is endemic and in ones where measles has been eliminated have reported immunity gaps in persons who received the vaccine on the two-dose schedule during childhood.[48,66,67](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r48) Most of these persons are 13 to 30 years of age, with some older than 40 years of age. Adults who have likely secondary vaccine failure account for some of the measles cases in outbreaks in well-vaccinated countries, as was the case recently in Mongolia.[68](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r68) A third dose of measles vaccine has been offered, mainly to health care workers, with similar safety and rates of adverse events as those seen with the recommended two doses. However, high antibody levels induced by the third dose waned quickly over a period of 1 to 3 years after the third dose.[69](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r69)\n\n### 2019 Increase in Measles Cases and Ongoing 2024–2025 Measles Crisis\n\nWorldwide, reported measles cases saw a dramatic increase in recent years, from a historic low of 132,490 in 2016 to 869,770 in 2019.[70](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r70) The global increase in measles cases in 2019 was driven by large outbreaks in several countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Samoa, Ukraine, and Brazil were the countries most affected. Vaccine hesitancy was an important cause in each of the affected countries.[70](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r70) This factor also contributed to the more than 100,000 measles cases in Europe in 2019 and the increased number of measles cases in the United States almost 20 years after the declaration that the disease had been eliminated in 2000.[71](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r71) In 2019, vaccine hesitancy was recognized by the WHO as one of the top 10 challenges to global health.[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r1) Since 2019, no WHO region has achieved and sustained elimination of measles.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic worsened the situation by interrupting routine immunization and catch-up campaigns. During the pandemic, global coverage of first measles vaccines decreased to 81%, the lowest level since 2008. Coverage has improved slightly, to 83% in 2022 and 2023.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) Low- and middle-income countries have the lowest coverage of first measles vaccines — 64% in low-income countries and 86% in middle-income countries.[29](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r29) A recent analysis of county-level rates of measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccinations in 37 U.S. states shows that coverage was below 95% in 990 of 1501 counties and below 74% in 70 counties.[72](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r72)\n\nThis poor coverage has sparked large measles outbreaks in several countries since early 2024, and measles is now spreading widely. In 2024, the European region reported the highest number of measles cases in more than 25 years, accounting for 20% of the total measles cases worldwide.[2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r2) In the United States, as of May 30, 2025, 1088 confirmed measles cases and 3 deaths have been reported; 96% of those measles cases involved persons who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. In approximately 12% of reported cases, the infected persons were hospitalized.[73](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r73) The current number of cases is already approximately four times as high as the total reported in 2024. If measles outbreaks continue to spread through the United States for more than 12 months, the country will lose its elimination status.\n\nMisinformation suggesting that measles vaccine causes autism and that vitamin A prevents measles has been a serious threat to effective measles control and management in the United States and worldwide. More than 25 years ago, a campaign of misinformation suggesting that measles vaccine causes autism led to loss of confidence in MMR vaccines, especially in the United Kingdom.[74](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r74) This misinformation has been thoroughly investigated and proved to be incorrect. In the United States, the recent decrease in childhood vaccinations has been associated with vaccine hesitancy. Estimates suggest that a 10% decrease in MMR vaccination in the United States may lead to 11.1 million measles cases over a period of 25 years.[75](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r75)\n\nThe withdrawal of the United States from global public health initiatives and from support of global immunization programs is having a profound effect on measles control worldwide. Specifically, removal of support for the WHO, for which the United States contributes 19% of the budget, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for which it contributes 13% of the budget, will probably affect measles control and contribute to a large number of deaths from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases in the poorest countries.[76](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r76) As a result, the outlook for measles control in the coming years is bleak. This situation puts U.S. domestic health security at high risk, because infectious diseases do not respect geographic borders.\n\nIn the context of increased international travel, rapid identification of measles cases and genotyping of measles virus are crucial for early detection of outbreaks, tracking of transmission chains, and effective outbreak control. Updates on measles diagnostic and molecular genotypes are provided in the [Supplementary Appendix](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap1).\n\n## Conclusions and Perspectives\n\nThere has been little improvement in global measles control over the past two decades. With a declining environment for global health ( [Figure 2](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#f2)), it is possible that the situation will get worse. Estimates of measles morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine hesitancy are needed to help contain vaccine hesitancy. Enhanced research during measles outbreaks is crucial to address population immunity gaps and improve vaccine coverage in the current measles vaccination program. Rapid diagnostic tests could be used routinely as part of measles global surveillance and could improve the timing of measles outbreak responses.[77](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r77)\n\n![](https://www.nejm.org/cms/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/asset/640a0d91-5511-4dac-a546-f7c060be4566/assets/images/large/nejmra2504516_f2.jpg)\n\nKey Events in Measles Research.\n\nCovid-19 denotes coronavirus disease 2019, EPI Expanded Programme on Immunization, LMICs low- and middle-income countries, MMR measles–mumps–rubella, SLAM signaling lymphocytic activation molecule, UNICEF United Nations Children’s Fund, and WHO World Health Organization.\n\nPostmeasles pneumonia has been shown to be largely due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_. The use of a booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for patients recovering from measles to help overcome temporary immunologic amnesia and possibly prevent fatal postmeasles pneumonia is a potential strategy. Clinical trials are needed to determine the appropriate time to administer pneumococcal conjugate vaccine during measles recovery.\n\nMeasles disease is most severe in young infants. Studies from West Africa have shown that measles vaccine can be highly effective, even when it is given as early as 4 months of age.[62](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r62) This finding needs to be reevaluated in the modern era.\n\nEfforts have been made to improve vaccine delivery[78](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r78) and storage.[79](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r79) Microneedle patches have been developed that offer the possibility of providing vaccination against measles and other conditions in remote areas where cold-chain transport is difficult. Microneedle patches also provide a pain-free, simplified method of vaccine administration. This innovation may help to improve vaccination coverage and reduce cold-chain issues. Additional randomized, controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of microneedle patches. In addition, further research on new measles vaccine candidates that can be given to younger infants is needed, because such vaccines may be required for eradication of measles.[80](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#core-collateral-r80)\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article was published on June 25, 2025, and updated on July 9, 2025, at NEJM.org.\n\n[Disclosure forms](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516#ap2) provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nSupplementary Appendix(nejmra2504516\\_appendix.pdf)\n\n- [Download](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/suppl_file/nejmra2504516_appendix.pdf)\n- 130.27 KB\n\nDisclosure Forms(nejmra2504516\\_disclosures.pdf)\n\n- [Download](https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMra2504516/suppl_file/nejmra2504516_disclosures.pdf)\n- 174.45 KB\n\n## References\n\n1.\n\nLarson HJ, Gakidou E, Murray CJL.

Unsurprisingly, nearly all 2025 cases have occurred in those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. Cases have been reported across a wide age range, indicating that this outbreak was years in the making due to long-standing gaps in measles vaccine coverage.\n\n“The ongoing outbreak we are seeing in the U.S. underscores the importance of maintaining adequate levels of measles vaccination,” says IVAC Executive Director William Moss, who co-leads the measles tracking project. “The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status should cases continue at this rate. As vaccine confidence continues to be undermined, immunization is more important than ever to end this outbreak and prevent future outbreaks from occurring.”\n\nThe U.S. Measles Tracker will continue to monitor new confirmed cases of measles, with data updated at least twice each week.\n\nThis collaborative, interdisciplinary effort reflects contributions from Johns Hopkins researchers at the [**Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)**](https://systems.jhu.edu/) at the Whiting School of Engineering, the [**International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC)**](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and [**the Bloomberg Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University.**](https://govex.jhu.edu/)\n\n## More From International Vaccine Access Center\n\n### [Track New RSV Products to Fight Pneumonia on VIEW-hub](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/track-new-rsv-products-to-fight-pneumonia-on-view-hub)\n\nNovember 11, 2025\n\n[![Pile of cash](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-10/AdobeStock_68360750_0.jpeg?h=5cc55aca&itok=nh87H1H0)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\n### [Estimating the Financial Costs of Measles Outbreaks](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks)\n\nOctober 28, 2025\n\n[![Children at school](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/related_content/public/2025-08/AdobeStock_176691784.jpeg?h=efb78a25&itok=F7may3Pr)](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\n### [Across the U.S., Childhood Vaccination Rates Continue to Decline](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline)\n\nAugust 20, 2025\n\n### [Request for Proposals: Applied Modeling for Public Health Workshop](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/request-for-proposals-applied-modeling-for-public-health-workshop)\n\nJuly 17, 2025\n\n### [As Global Vaccination Coverage Plateaus, Immunization Efforts are More Important Than Ever](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/311/2025/as-global-vaccination-coverage-plateaus-immunization-efforts-are-more-important-than-ever)\n\nJuly 15, 2025\n\n- [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Facebook\")\n- [Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&summary=The%20United%20States%20surpassed%20a%20milestone%20in%20reported%20measles%20cases%2C%20with%202025%20now%20having%20the%20most%20cases%20since%20the%20disease%20was%20declared%20eliminated%20in%20the%20U.S.%20in%202000%20and%20the%20most%20cases%20in%20more%20than%20three%20decades.%C2%A0&title=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on LinkedIn\")\n- [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=U.S.%20Measles%20Cases%20Hit%20Highest%20Level%20Since%20Declared%20Eliminated%20in%202000%20%7C%20Johns%20Hopkins%20%7C%20Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%E2%80%A6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublichealth.jhu.edu%2F311%2F2025%2Fus-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000 \"Share on Twitter\")\n\n## We use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience.\n\nBy clicking the Accept button, you agree to us doing so.\n\nLearn more\n\nAcceptNo, thanks",

An outbreak is defined as three or more cases of the same infectious disease linked to a common exposure.\n\nThere has been a rise in measles cases in the Upstate this year, with most concentrated in Spartanburg County.\n\nSome cases are travel-related exposures or close contacts of known cases. Other cases have no identified source, suggesting that measles is circulating in the community and could spread further. We have seen measles spread quickly in unvaccinated households here in South Carolina. We also know that it can spread quickly in unvaccinated communities based on outbreaks in other states.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Measles is highly contagious**:\n  - A person is **contagious four days** **before** **and** **after** **a rash begins**, meaning someone can spread measles before they know they are infected.\n  - The virus can **linger in the air for up to two hours** after an infected person leaves.\n- The measles vaccine (MMR and MMRV) is the best way to protect yourself and others against measles. Use the [DPH Recommendations for Measles Vaccination chart](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/Measles_Outbreak_Vaccine_Recommendations_20251020.pdf) to understand if you need to be vaccinated or not.\n\n## Updates\n\nWe will post measles updates twice a week, at noon on Tuesday and Friday. In time, this update frequency may change to more or less each week depending on disease activity.\n\n### Mobile Health Unit (MHU) Vaccines\n\nIn response to the ongoing measles outbreak, the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) has activated its Mobile Health Unit to deploy to the following locations to offer measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to unvaccinated individuals at no cost. _NOTE: The MMR vaccine is given as a two-dose series and booster doses are generally not needed. DPH also provides information about vaccine services by other providers.

Measles\n\nMost people recover from measles completely on their own. For uncomplicated cases, bed rest, drinking plenty of fluids and over-the-counter medications to reduce the fever and headache may help make infected individuals more comfortable. For those who require hospitalization, supportive care is the only treatment.\n\nDPH’s [measles page](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola \"Measles (Rubeola)\") contains what people need to know about measles (e.g., video, educational materials), and frequently asked questions about symptoms, prevention, vaccination history, and DPH’s role in protecting South Carolina from measles.\n\n### Understanding South Carolina's Vaccination Rates Among School Children\n\nWe still have vulnerable populations, both nationally and in South Carolina. The CDC reports that in 2025: the majority, 97%, of people who got measles were unvaccinated. Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa. Travelers with measles continue to bring measles into the U.S. Measles can spread easily when it reaches a community where groups of people are unvaccinated. Based on the 2021 CDC NIS (National Immunization Survey) Child data, coverage rates in the 19- to 35-month-old survey indicate that 88.9% of these aged children in South Carolina have had at least one dose of MMR vaccine. In South Carolina, two doses of MMR vaccine are required for school entry for kindergarten through 12th grade. For the 2023-2024 school year, 92.1% of kindergarten students had two doses of MMR vaccine, down from 95% for the 2019-2020 school year.\n\n- [45-Day Report of Schools with Required Immunization Certification, 2024-2025 School Year](https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-10/45_Day_Report_24-25_20251014.pdf) (pdf)\n- [School Vaccination Coverage and Exemption Data by County](https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and \"School Vaccination Coverage and Exemption Data by County\")\n\n### U.S. Data\n\nFind the latest numbers of confirmed U.S. measles cases.

Of the 57 cases, 47 were confirmed, and 10 were probable; of the 35 deaths, 25 were confirmed, and 10 were probable. Five of the confirmed cases were diagnosed in healthcare workers.\n\nEbola, which spreads through infected blood and other body fluids, typically causes fever and weakness, followed by diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n### **Children account for 23% of all infections**\n\nInfected patients range in age from 0 to 65 years, with those 0 to 9 years making up 23% of all cases. While females account for most cases (61%), their death rate is lower than that of males (56% vs 73%).\n\n> No international traffic-related measures are currently warranted.\n\n\"The outbreak shows a decreasing trend of cases in the recent week, nevertheless the attention remains high, and response activities are ongoing in all affected health areas including early case detection, isolation, case management, contact tracing, vaccination as well as risk communication and community engagement,\" the WHO wrote.\n\nAs of September 21, investigators have identified 1,180 contacts for follow-up. Of all contacts, 94 completed 21 days of monitoring, while the rest are still being tracked. Of 26 patients admitted to the Ebola Treatment Centre since the outbreak began, 2 recovered and were released on September 16, 5 died, and 19 are still being treated.\n\nIn total, 1,740 people have been vaccinated against Ebola in the Bulape, Bulambae, and Mweka Health Zones in the 9 days since the campaign began.\n\n\"No international traffic-related measures are currently warranted,\" the statement said.

The case was identified in an emaciated 2.5-year-old doe that was continuously drinking water and walked directly up to the responding conservation officer.\n\n\"Genesee County was under focused CWD surveillance in 2022, when approximately 300 deer were tested, with none testing positive,\" the press release said. \"The DNR has continued to test deer that appear sick in Genesee County when possible.\"\n\n### **State's first case in wild deer found in 2015**\n\n\"We appreciate the support and cooperation of the public as they continue to report sick deer so our team can follow up with the necessary testing for confirmation,\" Brent Rudolph, PhD, DNR deer, elk and moose management specialist, said in the release.\n\nSince CWD was first detected in Michigan wild deer in 2015, more than 110,000 deer have been tested for the disease in the state. In total, more than 144,000 wild deer have been tested since surveillance began in 2002, with 263 infected deer identified. Since direct hunter submissions of deer to the state's veterinary diagnostic laboratory began in 2020, more than 3,200 samples have yielded 56 additional confirmed cases.\n\nWe appreciate the support and cooperation of the public as they continue to report sick deer so our team can follow up with the necessary testing for confirmation.\n\nBrent Rudolph, PhD\n\nCWD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects cervids such as deer, elk, and moose. Caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions, the disease has also been found in Clinton, Dickinson, Eaton, Gratiot, Hillsdale, Ingham, Ionia, Isabella, Jackson, Kent, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, Ogemaw, and Washtenaw counties.\n\nNo cases of CWD infection have been reported in people, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that infected animals not be consumed by people or domestic animals.\n\nThe DNR said deer remains should be taken to a landfill or disposed of through regular bagged trash pickup. Deer harvested from known CWD-positive areas should never be left on the landscape.\n\n# Outpatient antibiotic use in COVID patients linked to 'downstream' antibiotic resistance\n\nNews brief\n\nSeptember 24, 2025\n\n[Chris Dall, MA](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chris-dall-ma)\n\nTopics\n\n[Antimicrobial Stewardship](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship)\n\n![Gloved hand with pills](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/iStock-1286336605.jpg)Plyushkin / iStock\n\nA [study](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/EVIDoa2400108 \"(opens in a new window)\") of more than 50,000 Canadian seniors diagnosed as having COVID-19 during the first 18 months of the pandemic found that antibiotic use within 7 days of diagnosis was associated with detection of antibiotic resistance organisms, researchers reported today in _NEJM Evidence._\n\nThe population-wide cohort study, led by researchers with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, analyzed data on residents of Ontario aged 66 years and older who had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021.\n\nBecause antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients was common in the early months of the pandemic in most countries, particularly in older patients, the researchers wanted to evaluate the relationship between peri–COVID-19 antibiotic exposure (within 7 days of index SARS-CoV-2 reporting) and isolation of an antibiotic-resistant organism from a clinical culture within 6 months.\n\nOf the 53,533 eligible patients included in the study, 8,228 (15%) were prescribed a peri–COVID-19 antibiotic, and 1,477 (3%) had a downstream drug-resistant organism identified. Peri–Covid-19 antibiotic use was significantly associated with the presence of any antibiotic-resistant organism (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\], 1.24; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.09 to 1.41) and the presence of gram-negative antibiotic-resistant organisms (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.46) but not gram-positive antibiotic-resistant organisms (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.48).\n\n### Stewardship in older adults, nursing home residents\n\nAmong all individuals who received an antibiotic, the attributable fraction of downstream antibiotic resistance related to peri–Covid-19 antibiotic use was 17% (95% CI, 7% to 26%). Among all individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the population-attributable fraction of downstream antimicrobial resistance related to peri–Covid-19 antibiotic use was 4% (95% CI, 2% to 7%).\n\n\"As antibiotics are often used in the outpatient setting in patients with Covid-19, without clear indications, this study suggests that a substantial burden of antimicrobial resistance in individuals with Covid-19 may have been avoidable,\" the study authors wrote\n\nThey add that the disproportionate impact on older, more vulnerable patients suggests that antimicrobial stewardship programs targeting antibiotic prescribing in older adults and those residing in nursing homes may be beneficial.\n\n# European Union launches One Health initiative for antimicrobial resistance\n\nNews
