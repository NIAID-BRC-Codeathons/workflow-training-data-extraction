At the University of Otago, New Zealand (NZ), student HCWs with or without two documented doses of Me-mumps (Mu) -rubella (Ru) (MMR) vaccine, are tested for Me, Mu, and Ru IgG by an indirect sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) and receive a third dose of MMR (MMR3) if seronegative for Me, Mu, or Ru. We compared Me seropositivity by CLIA with two tests at the Netherlands Public Health Institute (RIVM): in-house bead-based multiplex immunoassay (MIA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), using Me seropositivity thresholds of ≥16.5 Arbitrary Units (AU)/ml for CLIA and ≥ 0.12 International Units (IU)/ml for MIA and PRNT. Of 725 students, 175 (24.1 %) were below CLIA thresholds for ≥1 of Me, Mu, or Ru, and received MMR, with 88 (50.2 %) participating in the study. Seropositivity for Me by CLIA was significantly less common (43; 48.9 %; 95 % CI: 38.5, 59.4) than for MIA (80, 90.9 %; 95 % CI: 82.7, 95.4) or PRNT (74; 84.1 % (95 % CI, 74.8, 90.4). Among the 14 PRNT seronegatives, proportions of false positives by CLIA (4/43, 9.3 %) and MIA (7/80, 8.8 %) were similar. Among PRNT seropositives, the only MIA seronegative was in low positive (<0.24 IU/ml) range, whereas among CLIA seronegatives, 26/55 (47.2 %) had PRNT >0.24 IU/ml. Our finding that CLIA did not detect neutralizing antibody in a high proportion of vaccinated young adults agrees with other studies. In our study population, approximately 9 % of Me seropositives on both MIA and CLIA had PRNT <0.12 IU/ml. In elimination settings, non-PRNT serological tests have significant limitations in two-dose vaccinated HCWs, with implications for their use in screening to determine requirement for MMR3.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25011934)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012022)\n\n## Keywords\n\nMe\n\nMMR vaccine\n\nSerologic tests\n\nHealthcare worker\n\nLaboratory diagnosis\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nSince 2000, elimination of indigenous measles (Me) has been reported from many countries in the Americas, European, and Western Pacific regions following the achievement of long-term high uptake of two doses of Me-containing vaccines in childhood \\[ [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0005)\\]. In many of these countries, there has been evidence of waning of Me immunity among young adults about 10 to 15 years after the second dose of Me-containing vaccine. This evidence comes from two sources: reductions in Me antibody levels in relevant age groups from population-based serological surveys and increasing reports of Me infections in persons with documented receipt of two doses of Me-containing vaccine in childhood \\[ [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0010)\\]. Me outbreaks in countries with sustained elimination have often been centered on healthcare settings and included fully vaccinated healthcare workers \\[ [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0015), [4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0020)\\], who have a substantially higher risk of Me infection than the general population \\[ [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0025)\\]. However, recommendations for evaluation of Me immunity in health care workers vary widely internationally \\[ [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0025)\\]. As documentation of Me immunization status is often problematic in adults, Me seropositivity on serological testing or documented receipt of two doses of Me-mumps (Mu)-rubella (Ru) vaccine were both accepted as a proof of immunity by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) in 2011, a recommendation subsequently adopted in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand \\[ [\\[6\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0030), [\\[7\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0035), [\\[8\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0040), [\\[9\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0045)\\]. Despite this recommendation, some medical schools in the US and Canada require serological proof of Me immunity even if two previous doses of Me vaccine receipt has been documented \\[ [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0050)\\], and in New Zealand, this is a long-standing requirement for newly employed healthcare workers and students \\[ [11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0055)\\].\n\nSerological proof of immunity is usually obtained using commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), because of high throughput and wide availability. In most commercial assays, the manufacturer-provided threshold for seropositivity is derived from IgG antibody to Me nucleoprotein (N) rather than to the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins responsible for receptor attachment and host cell entry of Me virus \\[ [12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0060)\\]. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) measures neutralizing antibodies (binding directly to H and F glycoproteins) and is the gold standard for Me immunity because it directly measures the ability of serum to kill Me virus, preventing infection of cells \\[ [12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0060), [13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0065)\\]. The concentration of neutralizing antibody, as measured by PRNT, required for protection against clinically typical Me is set as ≥0.12 IU/ml based on a US study from 1990 \\[ [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0070)\\], prior to Me elimination, which found that 7/8 Me exposures resulting in clinically typical Me infection in a college outbreak occurred in persons with antibody concentrations below this level \\[ [\\[14\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0070), [\\[15\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0075), [\\[16\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0080)\\]. However, symptoms and substantial increases in antibody concentration, indicating likely Me infection, were found in persons with pre-exposure antibody concentrations up to 10 times higher (1.2 IU/ml), with consequent uncertainty about antibody correlates of protection against clinically typical as opposed to any Me infection \\[ [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0070), [16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0080)\\]. However, PRNT is costly, technically demanding and only available in reference laboratories, so EIAs continue to be used for routine screening of health care workers \\[ [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0050)\\].\n\nAt the University of Otago, New Zealand, commencing health science students are tested for Me, Mu and Ru antibodies using an indirect sandwich chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), a test in common use by routine diagnostic laboratories internationally \\[ [12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0060)\\]. In this study, we compared Me seropositivity measured by CLIA in a sample of students required to receive Me-Mu-Ru (MMR) vaccine by university policy because they were seronegative to Me and/or Mu and/or Ru with antibody levels to Me measured in the same serum sample at the Netherlands Public Health Laboratory (RIVM) using first an in-house bead-based multiplex immunoassay (MIA) closely standardized to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085)\\] suitable for high throughput testing \\[ [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0090)\\] and second using neutralizing antibody to Me measured by PRNT.\n\n## 2\\. Methods\n\n### 2.1. Eligibility criteria\n\n- 1.\nStudents aged 18–30 years enrolling in health science courses at the University of Otago in 2021 who had received 2-doses of MMR vaccine, confirmed by documentary evidence or if records were not available affirmed by signing a declaration, and had levels of Me and/or Mu and/or Ru antibody below the threshold for seropositivity in the CLIA assay.\n\n- 2.\nConsented to donate their pre-enrolment screening blood sample.\n\n\n## 3\\. Diagnostic tests\n\n### 3.1. CLIA\n\nDiaSorin(LIAISON®) is a semi-quantitative CLIA that detects Me-specific IgG (detectable range 5 to 300 AU/ml), and classifies Me seropositivity as ≥16.5 AU/ml, equivocal as 13.5- < 16.5 AU/ml, and seronegativity as <13.5 AU/ml \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085)\\]. As students with either seronegative or equivocal antibody concentrations were required to receive a booster dose of MMR, we classified all <16.5 AU/ml as seronegative.\n\n### 3.2. MIA\n\nMIA is a Luminex technology-based flow cytometry platform, developed in-house at the RIVM Netherlands for multiplexing Me, Mu, Ru, and varicella antibody measurement \\[ [19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0095)\\]. MIA is calibrated against the World Health Organization 2nd International Standard for Me antibody by PRNT, with false negatives when measured against the PRNT threshold of ≥0.12 IU/ml) were lower for MIA (4/153; 2.6 %) compared to four other commercial EIAs (each had a false negative rate of around 11 %) \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085)\\]. Another study of a panel of 70 samples comparing MIA with an in-house and several commercial EIAs showed a high correlation with PRNT (R2 ≥ 0.95) \\[ [19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0095)\\]. MIA classifies values ≥0.12 IU/ml as seropositive and values <0.12 IU/ml as seronegative \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085)\\].\n\n### 3.3. PRNT\n\nPRNT, considered the gold-standard for Me humoral immunity measurement, detects functional neutralizing antibodies, which include antibodies against haemagglutinin (H) and fusion proteins (F). The PRNT assay at RIVM followed the essential 24-plate culture protocol implemented by the WHO \\[ [20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0100)\\], modified to a 96-plate format, as previously documented \\[ [21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0105)\\].\n\nWe defined PRNT-based neutralizing antibody levels ≥0.12 IU/ml as immune, as this threshold corresponds to protection against typical Me, noting that immunological correlates for protection against Me infection of any severity are not well-defined \\[ [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0070), [16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0080)\\]. We defined a CLIA or MIA result as inaccurate if it identified a PRNT immune sera as seronegative or vice versa.\n\n### 3.4. Vaccination records and history of measles\n\nInformation on prior receipt of two doses of MMR was collected by verifying written vaccination records or when unavailable, via a signed declaration. Self-reported measles or mumps history was also collected from the participants.\n\n### 3.5. Analysis\n\nThe baseline characteristics of the study population were calculated in frequencies and percentages for the categorical variables and in mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. The CLIA and MIA seropositive and seronegative categories were cross-tabulated with PRNT immune (<0.12 IU/ml) and non-immune (≥0.12 IU/ml) categories, and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value calculated \\[ [22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0110)\\]. The normality of the Me antibody levels measured by DiaSorin, MIA, and PRNT were evaluated by inspecting histograms of the distribution of individual results.\n\n### 3.6. Sensitivity analyses\n\n- 1.\nVerification of immunization status: The performance of Me antibody seropositivity thresholds for PRNT vs DiaSorin and PRNT vs MIA were calculated separately for subjects with written records of vaccination and those whose vaccination status was derived only from a declaration.\n\n- 2.\nThreshold for seropositivity: As the correlate of protection for clinically typical measles may differ from that for infection with fewer symptoms \\[ [16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0080)\\], we examined the performance of MIA and DiaSorin when evaluated against a PRNT seropositivity threshold 2-fold (0.24 IU) and 4-fold (0.48 IU/ml) above 0.12 IU/ml \\[ [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0070), [16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0080)\\], categorizing PRNT of <0.12 IU/ml as negative, 0.12 to <0.24 IU/ml as low positive, 0.24 to <0.48 IU/ml as moderately high positive and ≥ 0.48 IU/ml as high positive. For MIA, thresholds were identical to PRNT and for CLIA the thresholds were: seronegative: <16.5 AU/ml, low positive: ≥16.5 to <33.0 AU/ml, moderately high positive: ≥33.0 to <66.0 AU/ml and high positives: ≥66.0 AU/ml, noting that the upper limit for CLIA is ≥300 AU/ml.\n\n\nAll analysis was done in Stata statistical software, version 18 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) and statistical significance was determined at _p_ < 0.05 (95 % confidence interval (CI)).\n\n## 4\\. Results\n\nIn 2021, 175 of 725 students screened at the University of Otago required MMR. Among students receiving an MMR dose, 101 consented to donate their screening blood sample for testing by PRNT and MIA, of whom 91 had antibody measurements available for all three tests and 88 were previously vaccinated with two doses of Me vaccine (analysis dataset; [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#f0005)).\n\n![Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0264410X25012289-gr1.jpg)\n\n1.

Among PRNT seronegatives (<0.12 IU/ml), a similar proportion were seropositive by CLIA (4/43, 9.3 %, 95 % CI: 3.4, 22.8) and MIA (7/80, 8.8 %, 95 % CI: 4.2, 17.4) i.e. false positives. In contrast, among PRNT seropositives, findings were divergent. For CLIA, of 45 below the 16.5 AU/ml test threshold for seropositivity, more than six times as many \\[35 (77.8 %, 95 % CI: 63.0, 87.8)\\] had neutralizing antibody >0.12 IU/ml (immune) on PRNT than for results below the 0.12 IU/ml seropositivity threshold MIA 1/8 (12.5 %, 95 % CI: 1.1, 64.2) ( [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#t0010)). A detailed distribution of antibody levels for CLIA (Fig. S4) and MIA (Fig. S5) is shown in scatterplots with increasing PRNT antibody levels shown on the X axis.\n\nTable 2.

Comparison of CLIA and MIA results for categories of PRNT antibody\n\nSubjects in 4 categories of PRNT antibody from <0.12 IU/ml (negative) to 0.12 to <0.24 IU/ml (low positive), 0.24 to <0.48 IU/ml (moderate positive) and ≥ 0.48 IU/ml (high positive) are shown in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#t0015) and in Supplementary Figs. S6-S7. Of 88 total subjects, 14 (15.9 %) were negative, 19 (21.6 %) low positive, 26 (29.5 %) moderately high and 29 (33.0 %) high positives by PRNT. All 8 MIA seronegatives were either negative or low positive by PRNT, whereas among CLIA seronegatives, 22/45 (48.9 %) had high or moderately high levels of PRNT antibody (Fig. S6, Fig. S7, [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#t0015)). Of the 7 MIA false positives, 6 had MIA antibody <0.24 IU/ml and one had MIA antibody ≥0.48 IU/ml ( [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#t0015)). Of the 4 CLIA false positives, 2 had antibody less than two-fold higher than 16.5 AU/ml (<33.0 AU/ml) and 1 had antibody levels >2-fold and 1 had antibody >4-fold higher than 16.5 AU/ml.\n\nTable 3.

Line-listed antibody results measured by MIA and CLIA as PRNT antibody increased from a minimum of 0.02 IU/ml to a maximum or 3.18 IU/ml are shown in Table S3.\n\n## 5\\. Discussion\n\nThe sensitivity of commercial assays for Me antibody testing (originally designed to detect antibodies in persons exposed to wildtype Me virus), is known to be suboptimal for measurement of low levels of antibody in persons with vaccine-acquired immunity \\[ [23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0115), [24](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0120)\\]. As a result, it has been long recommended in the US that individuals with two documented doses of Me-containing vaccine should be considered immune even if antibody levels are found to be below test thresholds for positivity \\[ [6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0030)\\]. However, in the context of health care workers at substantially higher risk of Me exposure during outbreaks, there is a rationale for serological screening even with documentation of two previous doses of Me containing vaccines, as Me infections in fully immunized adults have been reported from several countries post-measles-elimination \\[ [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0025)\\]. Despite this rationale, reflected in the policies of some training institutions \\[ [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0050), [11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0055)\\], conflict between institutional and national policies and variability in diagnostic test performance \\[ [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0050), [12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0060)\\] result in uncertainty.\n\nAlthough EIAs are known to classify individuals with levels of Me antibody modestly above the PRNT threshold of 0.12 IU/ml as seronegative, they have generally been presumed to accurately identify individuals not requiring an additional dose of Me-containing vaccine when seropositive (immune) \\[ [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0050), [12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0060), [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085)\\]. Our study population of previously vaccinated young adults, pre-selected to have a high prevalence of low Me antibody, offered the opportunity to examine the negative predictive value (among CLIA Me seronegatives) and positive predictive value (among CLIA Mu and/or Ru seronegatives who were seropositive for measles) of test thresholds for IgG assays suitable for high throughput testing (CLIA and MIA) using PRNT antibody as the reference standard. In this population, the MIA immunoassay had a negative predictive value for Me antibody much superior to CLIA (88.0 % vs 22.2 %), so that if a diagnostic test with similar characteristics to MIA had been used for initial screening serology, only around 10 % of the study participants rather than 50 % would have been classified as below the test threshold. However, we also found that both tests misclassified around 10 % of non-immune subjects with a PRNT titer <0.12 IU/ml as Me seropositive. Misidentification of Me seropositives by EIA has also been reported in the context of health care workers in a Me outbreak \\[ [25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0125)\\]. This discrepancy is likely attributable to detecting IgG directed against sites in the Me virus, particularly antibody to nucleoprotein, which are not neutralizing, rather than antibody directed against neutralizing epitopes (measles haemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F)) \\[ [13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0065), [15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0075), [25](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0125)\\].\n\nA systematic review \\[ [26](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0130)\\] of studies which compared head to head performance of EIAs with PRNT identified 11 high-quality studies of which only two were exclusively conducted in adults in elimination settings \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085), [27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0135)\\]. These were a Canadian study examining concordance of the BioPlex 2200 immunoassay with PRNT, finding 0/55 false positives and 30/93 (32 %) false negatives \\[ [27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0135)\\], and a study of 154 health care workers in the Netherlands aged 18–52 years (21 % with a past history of measles infection), which included only one subject with PRNT antibody <0.12 IU/ml, and found a false negative rate for CLIA of 17/18 (94.4 %) versus 4/5 (80.0 %) for MIA \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085)\\]. Thus our study of young adults with vaccine-acquired immunity, 50 % of whom had low Me antibody on CLIA, comparing a range of thresholds for seropositivity by PRNT with those for both the CLIA and MIA assays provides substantial new information about a population cohort who are an important consideration for measles outbreak investigations in elimination settings.\n\nContrary to our expectations, subjects who were seronegative on CLIA but had >0.12 IU/ml of antibody on PRNT were not concentrated in the low positive PRNT range but in almost 50 % of cases had PRNT antibody ≥0.24 IU/ml. In contrast, there was a close alignment of antibody levels measured by the MIA assay (using the same unit of measurement) with PRNT antibody levels among subjects with PRNT >0.12 IU/ml. It was surprising, as false positives had not been identified in previous studies \\[ [17](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0085), [27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0135)\\], that among subjects with antibody levels above seropositivity thresholds for both the CLIA and MIA assays, around 10 % had PRNT antibody levels <0.12 IU/ml.\n\n### 5.1. Strengths\n\nThe key strength of this study was the testing of neutralizing antibody levels by PRNT in a similar number of young adults who were Me seropositive and Me seronegative based on a commonly used EIA. We also compared the serum samples with an alternate IgG assay (MIA), known to be well correlated to PRNT, at a reference laboratory. Our high prevalence of low Me antibody levels by commercially available assays in young adults is similar to reports from other elimination settings.\n\n## 6\\. Limitations\n\nLimitations of our study included small sample size, testing of Me seropositives limited to those found on CLIA to be seronegative to Mu and/or Ru, limiting applicability to testing of Me antibody levels in an unscreened population, and inclusion of some students whose evidence of two previous doses of MMR was based only on declaration, not vaccination records. However, analysis of data restricted to those with records did not alter our findings. The 14 subjects with PRNT antibody <0.12 IU/ml all had measurable antibody, and we could not distinguish between primary and secondary vaccine failure as avidity testing was not available. However, young adult health care workers with low Me antibody are the population of interest for test performance and data evaluating whether Me seropositivity can be considered equivalent to evidence of receipt of two doses of Me-containing vaccine in such populations are sparse.\n\n## 7\\. Conclusion\n\nOur findings cast doubt on the usefulness of routinely available EIAs for determining immunity to Me in young adults vaccinated in childhood, likely to apply to similar settings with long-standing absence of endemic transmission. An early study of the value of serological screening in Australia, at a time when disease-acquired immunity was still common and vaccination status often not documented, concluded that pre-screening was cost-effective because of high baseline Me seropositivity (98 %) and vaccine costs \\[ [28](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0140)\\]. A more recent study in the UK with differing relative costs of testing and vaccination concluded that routine vaccination of health care workers was more cost effective than prescreening and selective vaccination \\[ [29](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0145)\\]. Thailand has recently adopted a policy of a third dose of MMR for all commencing health care workers and students, deemed necessary as part of measures to preserve the country's elimination status \\[ [30](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012289#bb0150)\\].\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Sumanta Saha:** Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Formal analysis, Conceptualization. **Rob van Binnendijk:** Writing – review & editing, Investigation. **James Ussher:** Writing – review & editing. **Hinke ten Hulscher-van Overbeek:** Writing – review & editing. **Melanie Millier:** Writing – review & editing. **Peter McIntyre:** Writing – review & editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Data curation, Conceptualization.\n\n## Funding information\n\nProf Peter McIntyre received Otago Medical Research Foundation (OMRF) funding \\[ **Grant number:  390** (Health Research South Approval Number 01755)\\] for this study.

Initial testing with a PCR-based method failed to detect vaccine virus. Sequencing later identified a novel mutation in the probe-binding site of the vaccine assay that had arisen after vaccination and resulted in the false-negative PCR test results.\n\n**Keywords:** measles, measles vaccine, measles diagnostic testing\n\n* * *\n\nMeasles, caused by a paramyxovirus, is effectively prevented by vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine. Public health interventions such as post-exposure prophylaxis are indicated only for wild-type infections \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r1), [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r2)\\]. Consequently, differentiation between wild-type measles and rash illnesses following measles-containing vaccine requires additional and time-sensitive testing. The measles virus is serologically monotypic, therefore genotyping by sequencing of the World Health Organization (WHO)-standardised region of the nucleoprotein (N450) has typically been required \\[ [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r3)\\]. All commercially available vaccines contain genotype A viruses, and most were derived from a single lineage, the Edmonston strain, in the 1960s \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r4)\\]. With successful implementation of long-standing vaccination programmes, wild-type genotype A virus no longer circulates \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r5)\\], and available sequence data indicate genetic stability of the vaccine \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r4), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r6)\\], permitting the development and use of PCR assays to identify measles vaccine virus \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r7)- [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r10)\\].\n\nThis case report describes a false-negative result from a vaccine strain-specific PCR assay and outlines the subsequent laboratory investigations.\n\n## Case investigation\n\nA healthy child in Ontario, Canada, presented to an emergency department 48 h after developing a rash, fever and conjunctivitis. The child had received the first dose of measles-containing vaccine using measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV; ProQuad, Merck Canada) 18 days before rash onset. The child had no history of recent travel or contact with travellers, and no known epidemiological link to an ongoing measles outbreak occurring in a neighbouring region of Ontario \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r11)\\].\n\nGiven the increased measles activity in the province, nasopharyngeal (NP) and urine specimens were collected for measles diagnostic testing using a PCR assay that includes three targets (F1, H1 and N3, adapted from Hummel et al. \\[ [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r12)\\]), and serum was collected for diagnostic serology. Measles virus was detected by PCR in both NP and urine specimens (hereafter referred to as positive), with average (across all three targets) quantification cycle (Cq) values of 32.44 and 26.83 respectively ( [Table](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#t1)). Measles serology was IgM-reactive, IgG-non-reactive. At the time of investigation, all PCR-positive measles specimens in Ontario (population 16 million) underwent reflex testing with a vaccine-specific PCR assay that detects measles genotype A virus (MeVA) \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r8)\\] at Public Health Ontario (PHO), the provincial public health laboratory. The vaccine PCR test was reported as ‘not detected’ (hereafter referred to as negative). Given the lack of epidemiological risk factors and the history of recent vaccination, PHO re-tested the urine specimen with both PCR assays to rule out the remote possibility of contamination and confirmed the reproducibility of the original laboratory findings (measles virus PCR test: positive, vaccine-specific PCR test: negative).\n\n### Table.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was attempted using tiling primers (modified from \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r15)\\] using an Illumina DNA Prep kit on an Illumina NextSeq platform) on the two lots of vaccine and the two patient specimens (NP and urine). Coding-complete whole genomes (defined as spanning the start codon of the nucleoprotein gene to the stop codon of the polymerase gene, inclusive) of 15,678 nt in length were obtained for the two vaccine lots and the urine specimen but not for the NP specimen. The two lots of vaccine had median depths of coverage of 1,760 and 1,808 reads with at least 50× coverage for all but the terminal 19 nt, where there were only two or three reads (GenBank accession numbers [PV948899](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PV948899) and [PV948900](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PV948900)). The urine specimen had median depth of 1,747 reads with >250× coverage for all but the terminal 35 nt, which had only four reads (GenBank accession number [PV948898](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/PV948898)). We compared these sequences with the measles WGS that had been previously published for the ProQuad vaccine \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r6)\\] (GenBank accession number [FJ211583](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ211583)) ( [Table](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#t1)). The sequences from both lots of the vaccine were identical to the published sequence. The measles WGS for the urine specimen bore two single nucleotide variations from the published and newly obtained vaccine sequence, both in the nucleoprotein gene at positions 407 and 1245 (numbered from the adenosine of the start codon of the nucleoprotein gene). The first (C407T) occurred in the probe-binding region of the MeVA assay in a central position (position 11 of the 23 nt probe) but not affecting the vaccine-specific nucleotide variation exploited by the assay \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r8)\\] ( [Figure 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#f2)). Targeted Sanger sequencing of both the urine and NP swab specimens confirmed that the C407T measles sequence anomaly was present in both samples. Given its position, it was probably responsible for the false-negative MeVA results. The sequence anomaly at the second position (C1245T) had been identified in the N450 region by Sanger sequencing ( [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#f1)).\n\nThese findings suggest two mutations arose in the vaccine virus within the patient, with one disrupting the probe binding site used in the MeVA assay. Vaccine-specific PCR-based assays targeting other regions of the genome would probably be unaffected. These mutations appear to be novel as identical sequences do not exist in GenBank. Attempts to culture the virus were unsuccessful because of low viral load.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore the genotype A results were available, the public health investigation team considered that the child’s mild clinical presentation, along with low viral load and a history of receiving MMRV vaccine more than 14 days before rash onset, could be consistent with an attenuated (mild), self-limited measles infection in a one-dose vaccinated individual (e.g. a breakthrough case of infection) following an unidentified exposure. The evolving nature of the measles outbreak in Ontario, which by October 2025 has been associated with more than 2,300 outbreak-related cases \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r11)\\], suggested the plausibility of an unrecognised exposure to measles.\n\nThe additional laboratory testing by NML resulted in the unexpected identification of measles vaccine genotype A, and further laboratory investigations were highly suggestive of viral mutation of the measles vaccine virus within the child, after vaccination. Wild-type measles virus is known to accumulate mutations over time as it passes from host to host, and it is through this viral evolution that measles genomic information can greatly support measles outbreak investigation and establish linkages between cases that are not previously apparent to public health investigators \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r5)\\]. Viral evolution among wild-type viruses resulting in nucleotide changes in the probe-binding region of the commonly used measles PCR test developed at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently been identified, raising some concern about the sensitivity of measles PCR assays that involve only a single target and the possibility of false-negative tests \\[ [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r16)\\].\n\nIn contrast, the measles vaccine virus accumulates extremely few, if any, mutations, even after prolonged replication and multiple passages in vitro \\[ [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r17), [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r18)\\]. This genetic stability is critical for ensuring the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. We could not identify other case reports of vaccine virus evolution in the literature or upon review of measles sequences in the public measles sequence repository (GenBank), suggesting the rarity of this event. However, we note as a limitation that systematic collection and sharing of measles genotype A viral sequences does not occur as it is only done for wild-type measles virus.\n\nWe recognise the potential for these findings to be misused by groups promoting vaccine misinformation. It is essential to emphasise that the child experienced only mild symptoms which fully resolved, that there is no evidence that measles vaccine virus is transmissible \\[ [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r19)\\], and that the child gained protection against measles during a period of heightened risk. This event occurred while Ontario was experiencing its largest measles outbreak since Canada achieved measles elimination in 1998 \\[ [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r20)\\]. The Ontario outbreak primarily impacted unvaccinated children and has been associated with significant morbidity and one infant death \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12579314/#r11)\\].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter nearly a decade of MeVA assay use at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), this has been the first documented instance of a false-negative result due to sequence variation, a testament to the stability of the vaccine. While such occurrences appear to be extremely rare, they underscore the importance of robust laboratory protocols. In Canada, measles PCR-positive specimens that test negative by MeVA undergo genotyping by sequencing, enabling identification of genotype A and differentiation from wild-type measles virus infections, which is critical for high quality measles surveillance and appropriate management of cases, particularly in elimination settings.\n\n## Ethical statement\n\nConsent for publication was provided by the patient’s family and in accordance with institutional guidelines. The public health investigation in Ontario was conducted under the legislative authority of _Ontario’s Health Promotion and Protection Act_. All work with clinical materials at the National Microbiology Laboratory was conducted under the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) reference diagnostic services mandate. In addition, laboratory investigations at the NML of the false negative vaccine PCR result does not constitute research as per Article 2.5 of Canada’s Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans – TCPS 2 (2022).\n\n## Use of artificial intelligence tools\n\nNone declared.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThank you to our NML colleagues in the Logistics and Material Services Unit who assisted with getting the vaccine to NML and to colleagues in Manitoba Health who provided the two vaccine lots to NML.\n\n**Authors’ contributions:** Sarah E Wilson: Investigation, Writing – original draft.

Only confirmed cases are reported to the CDC.\n\n# 2\\. THE DISEASE AND ITS EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\n# A. Etiologic Agent\n\nThe measles virus—a single-stranded, RNA-encoded paramyxovirus.\n\n# B. Description of Illness\n\nMeasles is characterized by a generalized maculopapular rash, fever, and one or more of the following: cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis.\n\nMeasles has a distinct prodrome that begins with fever and malaise. Additional symptoms can be conjunctivitis, coryza (sneezing, nasal congestion, and nasal discharge), cough, photophobia, and Koplik’s spots (which are pathognomonic but uncommonly observed). These spots are seen as bluish-white specks on a rose-red background appearing on the buccal and labial (lip) mucosa usually opposite the molars.\n\nTemperatures may exceed $4 0 \\\\mathrm { { } ^ { \\\\circ } C }$ $( 1 0 4 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { F } )$ , and usually fall 2–3 days after rash onset. High fever persisting beyond the third day of the rash suggests that a complication (e.g., otitis media) may have occurred.\n\nThe prodrome generally lasts 2–4 days before the rash occurs. The rash is maculopapular and begins on the head often along the hairline and spreads downward reaching the hands and feet. In severe cases, the lesions usually become confluent, especially on the face and upper body. Diarrhea occurs in $8 %$ of cases.\n\nComplications of measles include otitis media $( 7 % )$ , pneumonia $( 6 % )$ , and encephalitis $( 0 . 1 % )$ . Death occurs in 1–3 per 1,000 cases in the United States.\n\n# C. Measles in Washington\n\nBecause two doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine are now part of the routine childhood immunization schedule, measles is rarely reported in Washington. Most measles in the United States results from or can be linked to importation from areas of the world where measles is still endemic. In most years, fewer than 5 cases are reported in Washington.\n\n# D. Reservoirs\n\nAcutely infected humans.\n\n# E. Modes of Transmission\n\nVirus is spread directly from person to person by inhalation of suspended droplet nuclei or when infectious nasopharyngeal secretions come into contact with the mucous membranes of a susceptible person. Measles virus is sensitive to strong light and drying but remains infectious in aerosol form in air for approximately 2 hours. Measles is one of the most contagious of all infectious diseases, with $5 9 0 %$ attack rates among susceptible close contacts.\n\n# F. Incubation Period\n\nThe time from exposure to onset of fever ranges from 7–21 days (average 10 days), with the rash onset usually occurring within 2–4 days (range of 1-7 days) after the first symptoms appear and up to 21 days after the exposure. For investigation purposes, the “exposure period” is defined as 7–21 days prior to rash onset.\n\n# G. Period of Communicability\n\nMeasles is most communicable from the onset of prodrome through the first 3–4 days of rash. For investigation purposes, the “contagious period” is generally defined as the 4 – 5 days prior to the date of rash onset through at least the 4 days after the date of\n\nrash onset. Immunocompromised persons should be considered contagious for the duration of the illness.\n\n# H. Treatment\n\nNo specific treatment.\n\nThe WHO currently recommends vitamin A for all children with measles and many US experts concur for all children regardless of hospitalization status with measles in the United States.\n\n# I. Immunity\n\nImmunity to measles after natural infection or vaccination is probably life-long in most persons. In a small proportion of people $( \\\\leq 5 % )$ , protection after vaccination may be incomplete.\n\n(See Hickman, et al. J Infect Dis. (2011) 204 (suppl 1): S549-S558)\n\n# 3\\. CASE DEFINITIONS\n\n# A. Clinical Case Definition\n\nAn illness characterized by all the following:\n\n• a generalized rash lasting $\\\\geq 3$ days • a temperature $\\\\geq 1 0 1 . 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { F } \\\\left( \\\\geq 3 8 . 3 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { C } \\\\right)$ cough or coryza or conjunctivitis\n\n# B. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis\n\nIsolation of measles virus from a clinical specimen, or\n\n• Detection of measles-virus-specific nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction, or\n\n• Significant rise in serum measles immunoglobulin G $\\\\mathrm { ( I g G ) }$ antibody level between acute- and convalescent-phase specimens, by any standard serologic assay (see Comment), or\n\n• Positive serologic test for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody. §\n\n# C. Case Classification (2013)\n\nProbable (Not used in Washington State): In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, a case that meets the clinical case definition, has noncontributory or no measles laboratory testing, and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case\n\nConfirmed: An acute febrile rash illness† with:\n\nIsolation of measles virus‡ from a clinical specimen; or\n\n• Detection of measles-virus specific nucleic acid‡ from a clinical specimen using polymerase chain reaction; or\n\n• IgG seroconversion‡ or a significant rise in measles immunoglobulin G antibody‡ using any evaluated and validated method; or\n\nA positive serologic test for measles immunoglobulin M antibody $^ { \\\\ddagger \\\\mathsection }$ ; or\n\n• Direct epidemiologic linkage to a case confirmed by one of the methods above.\n\n† Temperature does not need to reach $\\\\ge 1 0 1 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { F } / 3 8 . 3 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { C }$ and rash does not need to last ${ \\\\ge } 3$ days.\n\n‡ Not explained by MMR vaccination during the previous 6-45 days.\n\n$\\ S$ Not otherwise ruled out by other confirmatory testing or more specific measles testing in a public health laboratory.\n\n# D. Comment\n\n• A surveillance case definition is a set of uniform criteria used to define a disease for public health surveillance.\n\n• All classifications are reported to CDE but only confirmed cases are reported to CDC.\n\n# E. Epidemiologic Classification of Internationally Imported and U.S-Acquired\n\nMeasles is no longer considered endemic in the United States. Measles cases are classified as either internationally imported or U.S.-acquired. An internationally imported case is one in which measles results from exposure to measles virus outside the United States as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period (7–21 days before rash onset) occurring outside the United States and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering the United States and there is no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time. All other cases are considered U.S.-acquired. U.S. acquired cases are further subclassified into four mutually exclusive groups: Import-linked cases, Imported-virus cases, Endemic cases, and Unknown source cases. Further information about these subclassifications can be found in the 2013 measles case definition at: [https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/measles-2013/](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/measles-2013/)\n\n# 4\\. DIAGNOSIS AND LABORATORY SERVICES\n\n# A. Laboratory Diagnosis\n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of measles is most often made by detection of measles RNA by RT-PCR. RNA A negative PCR does not rule out measles because this method is affected by the timing of specimen collection and the quality and handling of the clinical specimens.\n\nA measles diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating a significant rise in measles IgG antibody level in acute and convalescent sera, two serum specimens are always required. The first specimen should be drawn as soon after rash onset as possible, ideally within the first three days. The second specimen should be drawn 10–30 days later. The tests for IgG antibody should be conducted on both specimens using the same test at the same time. The specific criteria for interpreting such a test depend on the test used. Seroconversion from negative $\\\\mathrm { I g G }$ to positive IgG using specimens as described above confirms the diagnosis of measles. Demonstrating a rise in measles $\\\\mathrm { I g G }$ or seroconversion is not necessary when measles has been confirmed by another method. ( [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html#](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html#)\n\nMeasles IgM can be done in addition to PCR. Approximately $80 %$ of measles cases have detectable IgM antibody within 72 hours of rash onset. Serologic tests can result in falsenegative results when serum specimens are collected too soon after rash onset. If a negative result is obtained from a specimen drawn less than 72 hours after rash onset, another specimen will be required.\n\nFalse positive IgM results can occur, particularly when testing is being performed in a low prevalence population (i.e., people who do not meet the clinical case definition or people with no obvious risk factors for measles). False-positive IgM results for measles may be due to the presence of rheumatoid factor in serum specimens. In such instances, when a positive IgM result is obtained, the result should be interpreted with caution. Further testing is recommended.\n\nAlthough rarely done, the diagnosis can also be made by isolation of measles virus from a clinical specimen. Contact the receiving reference lab for timing of collection, shipping and storage instructions. A negative culture for measles does not rule out the diagnosis.\n\nNote: If viral testing results are noncontributory, additional testing can be performed for highly suspicious cases at CDC laboratories. Please call Communicable Disease Epidemiology (CDE) to discuss the timing of collection or the need for further testing. A small percentage of individuals who have previously been exposed to measles antigen (i.e., vaccinated for or had measles disease) can subsequently become infected by wildtype measles virus. Such persons may have a modified disease presentation, as well as a blunted or transient production of IgM. Therefore, a negative IgM test in vaccinated persons suspected of having measles should not be used to rule out the case. RT-PCR may be the best method to confirm such cases.\n\n# B. Services Available at the Washington State Public Health Laboratories (PHL)\n\nPHL performs measles polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Please contact an epidemiologist at CDE before sending specimens to PHL. Testing can be performed after hours and on the weekends if needed but would need to be specifically discussed and requested.\n\nNote that PHL requires all clinical specimens have two patient identifiers, a name and a second identifier (e.g., date of birth) on the specimen. Due to laboratory accreditation standards, specimens will be rejected for testing if not properly identified. As well as specimen source and collection date.\n\n# C. Specimen Collection and Submission\n\nWith LHJ approval, collect specimens for PCR (Preferred) as soon as possible after rash onset (maximum 9 days after rash onset). Send PCR specimens to the WA PHL. Day 0 is rash onset date:\n\nDay 0-72 hours of rash: Nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP)/throat swab Day $\\\\ge 7 2$ hours -10days of rash: NP/OP/throat swab plus a urine sample (urine may not be positive until ${ > } 4$ days after symptom onset)\n\nMeasles IgM can be done in addition to PCR but should not be the only method used as false positives are common.\n\n• Serum should be collected as soon as possible after onset Send serum for measles IgM to your facility’s usual reference lab, refer to their specific collecting, packaging and transporting instructions.\n\nMeasles-specific IgM antibody may not be present until 72 hours or more after rash\n\nonset.\n\n• For additional information regarding collection, storage and shipping of specimens for testing, see: [https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/public-health-laboratories/lab-testmenu?combine=measles](https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/public-health-laboratories/lab-testmenu?combine=measles)\n\nFor additional specimen shipping guidance, refer to the Measles Shipping Guide.\n\n# 5\\. ROUTINE CASE INVESTIGATION\n\nInterview the case and others who may be able to provide pertinent clinical information.\n\n# A. Evaluate the Diagnosis\n\n1. Review the clinical presentation, physical exam findings, travel history and other risk factors during the likely exposure period (7–21 days prior to the onset of rash), and immunization status of the patient to determine the likelihood of the diagnosis. Sources of immunization data might include medical records, parent immunization cards, school/childcare records and Child Profile. Names of vaccine products used outside the United States can be found in Appendix B of the Pink Book or online at: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/appendix/appdx-b.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/appendix/appdx-b.html)\n\n2. Determine whether to test for measles.\n\n\na. Testing should be performed on all unimmunized persons who meet the clinical case definition and have a known measles exposure or were in a high-risk setting during the likely exposure period (7–21 days prior to the rash onset).\n\nb. Testing is discouraged if a patient’s clinical presentation is not consistent with measles and the patient has no known increased risk for exposure to measles. This is true regardless of immunization status. Testing in these situations will increase the likelihood of obtaining a false positive result.\n\nc. All other situations will require clinical judgment. Although the clinical case definition only includes a generalized rash, fever $\\\\geq 1 0 1 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { F }$ , and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis, there are aspects of the clinical presentation which can increase the suspicion for measles. A measles rash usually starts on the head or face and spreads downward and the fever is generally still present at the time the rash begins. The source of acquisition for $1 1 %$ of measles cases reported in the United States during January–July 2008 could not be determined (MMWR 2008;57(No. 33):893); therefore, persons with a clinical presentation suspicious for measles who lack a known risk factor for measles exposure should still be tested, particularly if they are known to be susceptible.\n\nd. The occurrence of measles-like illness in recently vaccinated persons can pose difficulties: Fever and rash are known to occur 6-12 days post-vaccination in a small percent of vaccinated persons. A positive measles $\\\\mathrm { I g M }$ test cannot be used to confirm the diagnosis of measles in persons with measles-like illness who received measles vaccine 6-45 days before onset of rash due to the measles IgM antibody response to the vaccine. Vaccine strains can be distinguished from wild-type viruses by real-time RT-PCR. In the absence of strain typing to confirm wild type infection, cases in persons with measles-like illness who received measles vaccine 6-45 days before\n\nonset of rash should be classified as confirmed cases only if:\n\n1. they meet the clinical case definition, and\n2. they are epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case.\n\ne. A small number of individuals that were previously exposed to measles (more than 45 days before the onset of rash) may still become infected by wild-type measles virus and are likely to have a modified disease presentation. These cases are usually detected during an outbreak or after a known exposure to a confirmed measles case. In rare instances, such cases can occur without a known exposure or other risk factor. If modified measles in a previously vaccinated person is suspected, call Communicable Disease epidemiology to discuss.\n\nf. Consider differential diagnosis: fifth disease, roseola, rubella, scarlet fever (also called scarlatina), adenovirus infections, influenza, certain vector-borne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and antibiotic reactions.\n\n3. Collect selected specimens at the first clinical encounter.\n\n4. A positive IgM result from a commercial laboratory and the person has symptoms consistent with measles, consult WA DOH for further instructions.\n\n\n# B. Identify Potential Sources of Infection\n\nUsing a guide such as the “Measles Worksheet Part A” (see Appendix A), evaluate the activities of the case during the likely exposure period (7–21 days prior to the onset of rash). Identify situations where the case might have been at increased risk of exposure to measles. Collect the following information:\n\n1. contact information for any household member, playmate, or other contact who had a rash illness during the likely exposure period\n2. any travel outside of the United States or to an area of the United States where measles has recently occurred\n3. any contact with visitors from outside the United States or an area of the United States where measles has recently occurred\n4. any visit to a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital (find out exact time\\[s\\], date\\[s\\], name of the clinic\\[s\\], duration of visit\\[s\\], and areas of the facility visited)\n5. any indoor group activities attended (e.g., church, theaters, tourist locations, public or commercial travel, parties, athletic events, family gatherings) and contact information of the person who organized the group or event\n6. any work or volunteer activities in a health care setting, or attendance or work at a school, childcare, college, prison, refugee center, etc.\n\n# C. Identify Exposed, Susceptible Contacts and Potential Sites of Transmission\n\n1. Using the “Measles Worksheet Part B” (Appendix A), evaluate the activities of the case during the contagious period (4–5 days before through at least 4 days after the date the rash started). Because measles is so contagious, anyone with direct contact with the case is exposed along with anyone who was in the same room with a case for even a few minutes. Measles virus lingers in the air, so anyone who enters a room within 2 hours after a measles case should also be considered exposed.\n\n2. Consider initiating a “Measles Contact Tracking Form” (Appendix B) for each contact identified.\n\n3. Determine measles immune status of exposed contacts. Persons are considered immune to measles if they [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html)\n\n\na. were born before January 1, 1957 (except for health care workers who should consider receiving at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine), or\n\nb. have documentation of health care provider-diagnosed measles, or c. have laboratory evidence of immunity to measles, or d. have written documentation of adequate vaccination to measles that includes the date of administration (self-reported doses or parental history of vaccination alone are not acceptable).\n\nPreschool children: one MMR given after 12 months of age\n\nK–12 and adults at high risk (i.e., post-high school educational and college students, healthcare personnel, and international travelers): 2 MMR, with the first dose given on or after the first birthday and with a minimum of 28 days between the first and the second dose.\n\n• All other adults born during or after 1957: history of having received at least one dose of live measles virus vaccine on or after the first birthday\\*\n\n\\\\* Persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine that was available from 1963-1967, and have not been re-vaccinated, may however be at risk for measles.\n\n4. Alert health care facilities visited by the case during the contagious period and make recommendations regarding management of susceptible contacts (see Section 7B and Appendix E: Algorithm for assessment and management of persons with definite exposure to measles and public callers with possible exposure to measles at a public site)\n\n5. If transmission may have occurred in a public place and potentially exposed individuals cannot be identified, a press release may be the best way to inform the public. The press release should include information about the time and place of exposure, susceptibility, symptoms of measles and ways people can protect themselves.\n\n\n# D. Enhance Surveillance for Additional Cases\n\nAlert health care providers, hospital emergency rooms, and student infirmaries of the potential for additional cases; encourage health care providers to consider measles in persons with a rash illness, take appropriate infection control precautions, and report suspected cases to public health. See Appendix D for a sample health alert.\n\n# 6\\. CONTROLLING FURTHER SPREAD\n\n# A. Infection Control Recommendations/Case Management\n\nIn addition to Standard Precautions, hospitalized patients should be cared for using Airborne precautions until 4 days have passed since the onset of the rash, onset of rash considered to be Day 0 (or for the duration of illness if the patient is immunocompromised).\n\nPersons suspected to have measles should be advised to do the following during the contagious period, onset of rash considered to be Day 0 (until 4 days have passed since the onset of the rash) or for the duration of illness if the patient is immunocompromised:\n\n• stay home and not go to childcare, school, work, public places or social activities. prohibit contact with susceptible children (particularly infants), susceptible pregnant women, and immunosuppressed individuals. avoid contact with susceptible family members and visitors; and\n\navoid exposing other people at health care facilities by calling ahead and making special arrangements to prevent contact with others.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html)\n\n# B. Contact Management\n\nUse the “Measles Contact Tracking Form” in Appendix B or a similar form to track all persons potentially exposed to the case. The algorithm in Appendix E outlines strategies that can be used for assessment and management of persons with definite exposure to measles versus public callers with possible exposure to measles at a public site.\n\n# 1\\. Symptomatic Contacts\n\nAny contact with a rash illness compatible with measles should be referred to a healthcare provider for assessment.\n\n• Susceptible contacts with respiratory symptoms or fever should stay home and call their local health jurisdiction.\n\nIf a contact goes a healthcare provider for evaluation of possible measles, the patient or public health should call ahead to ensure that facility personnel are aware of the specific reason for referral so that special arrangements can be made to keep them out of areas used by other patients.\n\n• Persons with possible measles should avoid contact with others until the diagnosis is known.\n\n# 2\\. Active Immunization with Measles Vaccine (persons 12 months of age or older)\n\n• Vaccinating susceptible contacts within 72 hours of exposure may prevent disease. If 72 hours has passed since the exposure, vaccination is unlikely to prevent disease due to the exposure. Vaccination is still recommended to prevent future infection but should be done after at least one incubation period has passed to avoid complications with diagnosis of true measles versus vaccine reaction should the person become symptomatic. Susceptible, previously unimmunized persons should receive their first MMR and persons who have received one dose should receive a second dose, if indicated. See Section 8 for recommendations and contraindications for vaccination.\n\nWhenever possible, persons without documentation of immunity should have blood drawn and tested for measles IgG prior to being vaccinated. Exclusion will not be necessary if the person is found to be immune.\n\n• Public health may need to arrange special clinics to vaccinate susceptible contacts and\n\nothers from the community.\n\n# 3\\. Passive Immunization with Immune Globulin (IG)\n\nIG can prevent or attenuate infection with measles if given within 6 days after exposure. IG is recommended primarily for susceptible household contacts and other close contacts who are at increased risk of severe infection (e.g., children $< 1$ year old, pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity, and severely immunocompromised persons). IG is not recommended for close contacts who have received one dose of vaccine on or after the first birthday unless they are immunocompromised.\n\n• Patients should be warned that IG may modify but not prevent measles infection and may also increase the incubation period to 28 days.\n\nThe recommended dose for IG administered intramuscularly (IGIM) is $0 . 5 0 \\\\mathrm { m l / k g }$ (maximum dose $1 5 \\\\mathrm { m l }$ ) and for IG given intravenously (IGIV) is $4 0 0 \\\\mathrm { m g / k g }$ . To be effective, IG must be administered as soon as possible but not more than 6 days after exposure. The recommended methods of IG administration for the groups at increased risk are as follows:\n\no Infants $\\\\mathbf { < 1 }$ year old. IGIM should be administered to all infants aged $^ { < 1 2 }$ months who have been exposed to measles. For infants aged 6 through 11 months, MMR vaccine can be administered in place of IG if administered within 72 hours of exposure.\n\no Pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity. IGIV should be administered to pregnant women without evidence of measles immunity who have been exposed to measles. IGIV is recommended to administer doses high enough to achieve estimated protective levels of measles antibody titers.\n\no Immunocompromised patients. Severely immunocompromised patients who are exposed to measles should receive IGIV prophylaxis regardless of immunologic or vaccination status because they might not be protected by the vaccine.\n\nSeverely immunocompromised patients include patients with severe primary immunodeficiency; patients who have received a bone marrow transplant until at least 12 months after finishing all immunosuppressive treatment, or longer in patients who have developed graft-versus-host disease; patients on treatment for ALL within and until at least 6 months after completion of immunosuppressive chemotherapy; and patients with a diagnosis of AIDS or HIV-infected persons with severe immunosuppression defined as CD4 percent $< 1 5 %$ (all ages) or CD4 count $< 2 0 0$ lymphocytes $/ \\\\mathrm { m m } 3$ (aged ${ > } 5$ years) and those who have not received MMR vaccine since receiving effective ART. Some experts include HIV-infected persons who lack recent confirmation of immunologic status or measles immunity.\n\n• Unless known to be susceptible to measles (i.e. unvaccinated and with no history of measles disease) persons without documentation of immunity should have blood drawn prior to administration of IG, if possible, to test for the presence of measles IgG (prior immunity). However, administration of IG should not be delayed past 72 hours when results of immunity testing are pending.\n\nSusceptible contacts who received IG for measles prophylaxis should subsequently be immunized against measles no earlier than 6 months after IGIM administration or 8 months after IGIV administration provided the person is then aged ${ \\\\ge } 1 2$ months and the vaccine is not otherwise contraindicated.\n\nDavid W.

Exclusion\n\nSusceptible, previously unimmunized contacts should obtain IgG titers to determine immunity. Home quarantine while awaiting results; if IgG negative, avoid all public settings from 7 days after the first date of exposure until 21 days after the last date of exposure regardless of whether or not they received vaccine within 72 hours or IG within 6 days of exposure.\n\nContacts who had received one dose of measles-containing vaccine prior to the exposure and who now receive a second dose following the exposure do not need to be excluded from public settings. However, they should be educated about symptoms of measles and told to isolate themselves and notify the local health jurisdiction if symptoms develop.\n\n5. Contacts who had received one dose of measles-containing vaccine prior to the exposure that choose not to receive a second dose of vaccine after exposure should be told to avoid public settings until 21 days after the last possible date of exposure to the case, educated about symptoms of measles, and instructed to notify the local health jurisdiction if symptoms develop.\n\n# 6\\. Education\n\nAll exposed persons regardless of immune status should be told to watch for symptoms of measles until 21 days after the last exposure to the communicable person. If suggestive symptoms develop, they must isolate themselves and call the local health department as soon as possible.\n\nIf exposure has occurred among a large group or in a public setting, consider educating potentially exposed persons and making recommendations via letters or press release.\n\n# C. Management of Other Exposed Persons\n\nPersons potentially exposed to the same source as the case or present in the same highrisk setting during the likely exposure period should be told to watch for symptoms of measles particularly during the 7 to 21 days following exposure regardless of immune status.\n\n# D. Environmental Measures\n\nNone. If a person communicable with measles is examined in a health care facility, the examination room should be cleaned and closed to use for up to 2 hours.\n\n# A. Cases among Employees or Attendees at School/Childcare Facility\n\n1. Exclude persons with suspected measles from school or childcare until 4 days have passed since rash onset (that is they can return on the $5 ^ { \\\\mathrm { t h } }$ day after the day of rash onset) if not immunocompromised.\n\n2. All students and school staff born in or after 1957 who cannot provide adequate evidence of immunity should be vaccinated. Vaccine should be offered, if possible, to those who are not up to date with age-appropriate vaccination. A first dose should be given to those who are unvaccinated. Recommend a second MMR to persons who have previously received only one MMR as long as 28 days have passed since the first dose.\n\n3. Identify all persons at the school who were potentially exposed to the case.\n\n\na) Recommend that susceptible, unimmunized persons receive the MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure (or if immunocompromised, pregnant or under one year of age, immune globulin (IG) within 6 days). Exclude all exposed persons who were susceptible and unimmunized at the time of exposure regardless of whether or not they have received post exposure vaccine or IG.\n\nb) Exposed persons who had received one dose of measles-containing vaccine prior to the exposure can return to school or childcare after they receive their second dose of MMR but should be educated about symptoms of measles and told to stay home if symptoms develop.\n\nc) Susceptible, unimmunized persons and partially immunized persons (i.e. persons who had received only one prior dose of MMR) who continue to refuse the recommended measles vaccination(s) following exposure to measles should be excluded from the school or childcare until 21 days after rash onset in the last cases of measles.\n\n4. Maintain daily active surveillance of all school or childcare contacts to assess for prodromal signs and symptoms of rash illnesses compatible with measles for 21 days from the last possible exposure in the school.\n\n# B. Case in a Medical Setting\n\n1. To prevent measles outbreaks in health care settings, health care workers (volunteers, trainees, nurses, physicians, technicians, receptionists, and other clinical support staff) should have documented immunity to measles before exposure, ideally as a condition of employment. Health care facilities should maintain readily available documentation of immunity. Acceptable evidence of immunity to measles in health care workers includes:\n\nDocumented administration of 2 doses of live measles virus vaccine given on or after the first birthday (inactivated measles vaccines were in use from 1963– 1967), or Laboratory evidence of immunity, or • Born before January 1, 1957 – Healthcare facilities should consider recommending measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination for unvaccinated workers born before 1957 without a history of measles disease or laboratory evidence of immunity, or\n\n• Documentation of health care provider-diagnosed measles.\n\n2. If a person with measles is treated in a health care setting during the contagious period, identify potentially all exposed health care workers, volunteers and other staff and assess the status of their immunity to measles.\n\n3. If an exposed healthcare worker has had only one documented dose of measlescontaining vaccine, give an additional dose of vaccine. If the second dose can be given with 72 hours of exposure, consider the person immune. If vaccine cannot be administered within 72 hours, send a specimen for measles IgG serology, and consider the person immune if the test is positive for measles specific IgG.\n\n4. If the exposed healthcare worker was born on or after January 1, 1957, and has no documented evidence of immunity, a dose of measles-containing vaccine should be given immediately and no more than 72 hours after exposure. A serologic test for measles IgG should be done to verify immunity. If immunity to measles is not serologically confirmed, the person must be excluded from day 5 after the first exposure to day 21 after the last exposure.\n\n5. If the exposed healthcare worker was born before January 1, 1957, and has no documented evidence of immunity, a serologic test for measles IgG should be considered to verify immunity. If immunity is not confirmed, the person must be furloughed from day 5 after the first exposure to day 21 after the last exposure.\n\n6. If the exposed healthcare worker has had two documented doses of measles vaccine given on or after the first birthday and at least 28 days apart, consider the person immune.\n\n7. In summary, exposed susceptible health care workers should be immunized immediately and no more than 72 hours after exposure, and furloughed from day 5 after the first exposure to day 21 after their last exposure. This includes healthcare workers born in 1957 or later who have no documented evidence of immunity, and workers born in 1957 or later with only one previous dose of measles-containing vaccine documented who did not receive a second dose within 72 hours of exposure. (If furloughing of this second group is not possible due to large numbers exposed, these staff should have their temperatures taken and be assessed for prodromal symptoms when they come to work on the ${ \\\\bar { 5 } } ^ { \\\\mathrm { t h } }$ through $2 1 ^ { \\\\mathrm { s t } }$ day after the exposure. Anyone with a fever, cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis should be furloughed for the duration of symptoms and assessed for measles if a rash develops. This screening procedure must be followed rigorously to prevent staff members with prodromal measles from infecting others. Link to Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Measles in Healthcare Settings: [https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/healthcare-personnel-epidemiologycontrol/measles.html](https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/healthcare-personnel-epidemiologycontrol/measles.html)\n\n8. Healthcare workers who develop measles must avoid patient contact until 4 days have passed since the rash onset.\n\n9. Only health care workers with documented immunity to measles should enter the room of a suspected measles patient.\n\n10. Exposed patients should likewise have their immune status assessed and be given vaccine if they are not immune; school and work restrictions of unimmunized contacts apply.\n\n\n# A. Immunization Recommendations\n\nRoutine immunization with MMR is recommended during childhood; the first dose of MMR is recommended at 12–15 months of age with a second dose recommended at 4–6 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine are also recommended for students attending college and other post-high school institutions, international travelers, and healthcare personnel. Persons born in 1957 or later should receive at least one dose of MMR if they do not have evidence of immunity to these three diseases. Approximately $9 5 { - } 9 8 %$ of susceptible persons develop measles antibodies after a single dose of vaccine. After two doses of vaccine, $9 9 %$ of persons develop serologic evidence of measles immunity.\n\nBefore any international travel, infants 6 months through 11 months of age should have 1 dose of measles vaccine. Infants who received 1 dose of measles vaccine before their first birthday should get 2 additional doses of the vaccine (one dose at 12 through 15 months of age and another dose at least 28 days later).\n\nIn certain outbreak settings, health officials may recommend the MMR vaccine be given to infants younger than 12 through 15 months of age, sometimes even to children as young as 6 months of age. However, since the decision to vaccinate children less than 12 months of age has vaccine supply implications for the state, the decision to implement this recommendation at the local level should include a prior discussion between the local health jurisdiction, CDE, and the WA DOH Immunization Program.\n\nContraindications to vaccine include:\n\na history of a severe allergic reaction (i.e., hives, swelling of the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, shock) following a previous dose of measles vaccine or vaccine components (e.g., neomycin, gelatin) (MMR can be given to egg-allergic persons) pregnancy significant immunosuppression • recent receipt of antibody-containing blood products\n\nModerate or severe acute illness is a precaution, not a contraindication, and vaccination should be considered during an outbreak.\n\nFor more information about MMR vaccine schedules, adverse reactions and contraindications please see the current Pink Book.

In countries such as the United States where endemic circulation of measles has been eliminated, most suspected cases are not measles, rash and fever are more likely due to other rash-causing illnesses.\n\nTo minimize false positive test results that can occur in low prevalence settings, it is important to limit testing to those patients who meet both the measles clinical case definition and epidemiological risk.\n\n# Measles clinical case definition:\n\nAn illness characterized by all the following:\n\na generalized rash lasting greater than or equal to 3 days\n\na temperature greater than or equal to $1 0 1 . 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { F }$ (greater than or equal to $3 8 . 3 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathrm { C }$ )\n\ncough, coryza, or conjunctivitis\n\nSometimes the characteristic rash does not develop in immunocompromised patients\n\n# Epidemiological risk factors in the past 21 days:\n\n• Known contact with a measles case or an ill person with fever and a rash\n\n• Contact with an international visitor who arrived in the U.S.\n\n• Travel outside the U.S.\n\n• Domestic travel through an international airport\n\n• Visited a U.S. venue popular with international visitors such as a large theme park • Lives in or visited a U.S. community where there are measles cases\n\n# Specimens for RT-PCR testing (preferred)\n\nDetection of measles RNA in a clinical specimen can provide laboratory confirmation of infection. Throat, nasopharyngeal (NP) Urine and swab are the preferred specimen types. For detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RNA detection is more likely to be successful when samples are collected on the first day of rash through 3 days following onset of rash. With the greatest diagnostic sensitivity when specimens are collected at first contact with a suspected case.\n\n# Specimen(s) for viral isolation: (rarely used for the diagnosis of measles)\n\nContact the commercial laboratory for collection and submission instructions.\n\n# Specimens for serology\n\nIgG: IgG testing for acute measles requires demonstration of a rise in level of antibody against measles virus Because tests for IgG require two specimens, and because a confirmed diagnosis cannot be made until the second specimen is obtained, IgM tests are generally preferred serology.\n\nIgM: Detection of specific IgM antibodies in a serum specimens collected within the first few days of rash onset can provide presumptive evidence of a current or recent measles virus infection. No assay is $100 %$ specific, serologic testing of non-measles cases using any assay will occasionally produce false positive IgM results. Serum specimens are collected too early with respect to rash onset may result in false negative results.\n\nMeasles IgM is not available at the WA PHL. However, for highly suspect or indeterminate cases, WA PHL may request a serum sample to forward to CDC for testing.\n\n![](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/images/e9c56b39e65298ce2da7b5e67e0d099efb0acfb899d8f7b6f787f50c478c78ad.jpg)\n\n# APPENDIX E: INTERPRETATION OF SEROLOGY RESULTS\n\nThe person’s immune status plays a role in deciding which serologic tests should be ordered and in the interpretation of the results. Here is a quick overview:\n\n# On an unimmunized person\n\nSpecimen collected less than 72 hours after the date of rash onset: Test for IgM. IgM positive $=$ measles confirmed IgM negative $=$ cannot rule out measles Collect another specimen 72 hours or more after rash onset\n\nSpecimen collected 72 hours or more after the date of rash onset: Test for IgM and IgG IgM positive/IgG positive or negative $=$ measles confirmed IgM negative/IgG negative $=$ measles ruled out\n\nOn a person with unknown immunization history or on a person with documented history of one or more doses of measles-containing vaccine\n\nSpecimen collected less than 72 hours after the date of rash onset: Test for IgM and IgG IgM positive/IgG positive or negative $=$ measles confirmed IgM negative/IgG negative $=$ cannot rule out measles Collect another specimen 72 hours or more after rash onset Did not respond to vaccination or was never vaccinated IgM negative/IgG positive $=$ measles ruled out Demonstrates previous immunity to measles due to either prior vaccine or previous diseas\n\nDemonstrates previous immunity to measles due to either prior vaccine or previous disease\n\nPlease note: False positive IgM results for measles are not uncommon. False- positive IgM results may be due to the presence of rheumatoid factor in serum specimens. Serum specimens from patients with other rash illness, such as parvovirus B19, rubella, and roseola, have been observed to yield false-positive reactions in some IgM tests for measles. False-positive tests may be suspected when thorough surveillance reveals no source or spread of cases, when the case does not meet the clinical case definition, or when the IgG result is positive within 3 days of rash onset. When a laboratory IgM test result is suspected of being false-positive, additional tests may be performed following consultation with WA DOH Communicable Disease Epidemiology.\n\nLast Revised: January 2025\n\nPage 22 of 26\n\n# APPENDIX F: HEALTH ALERT TEMPLATE\n\nInsert LHJ logo here\n\n# Measles Alert for \\[LHJ\\] Health Care Providers and Clinic Directors\n\nDate: \\[Insert Message Date\\]\n\nThis is a Provider Alert from the \\[insert LHJ/Jurisdiction Name\\]:\n\nCurrent Situation in Washington:\n\nEXAMPLE: ###confirmed cases of measles (rubeola) have occurred in (number) residents of (county) did these people have international travel, communal living? or exposed to someone who did, are they immunized is there a known exposure?

Usually cold symptoms precede the onset of the rash by two to four days, fever and the rash the typically overlap, a measles case will often feel ill enough to seek medical care BEFORE rash onset. If a patient has presented with coryza, light sensitivity, or cough with high fever and has a possible history of\n\nLast Revised: January 2025\n\nPage 23 of 26\n\nhaving been present at one of the events mentioned above, please consider measles a possibility and notify the health department immediately. The red rash usually begins on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Koplik spots appear inside the mouth on the buccal mucosa and look like grains of sand. (Absence of Koplik spots does not rule out measles). Complications of measles can include otitis media, bronchopneumonia, laryngotracheobronchitis, diarrhea, and encephalitis.\n\n# Diagnosing measles:\n\nControl measures are more effective when applied as early as possible. If you suspect measles, contact \\[LHJ\\] immediately. During regular business hours call \\[phone number\\]. After hours call our answering service after hours at \\[phone number\\] to have the physician on call paged. We will assist you with collection of specimens and rapid testing at a public health laboratory. Do not wait for laboratory confirmation before reporting. Control measures are most effective if public health can contact those exposed within 72 hours of exposure.\n\nAPPENDIX G: Algorithm for assessment and management of persons with definite exposure to measles and public callers with possible exposure to measles at a public site\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Immunization | Birth before 1957 | 2 doses | 1 dose& | 0 doses | Unknown |\n| Status → Risk assessment: | Presumed immune | Presumed immune | ~95% effective | Susceptible! | Presume susceptible |\n| Prophylaxis: | None | None | MMR within 72 hours of exposure | MMR within 72 hours of exposure; Consider IG (if indicated') within 6 days | MMR within 72 hours of exposure; Consider IG (if indicated') within 6 days |\n| Recommendations: | No recommendations | No recommendations | Second MMR recommended even if | of exposure\\* Close Contacts (Asymptomatic) | Public Callers# (Asymptomatic) | of exposure\\* Close Contacts (Asymptomatic) | Public Callers# (Asymptomatic) |\n|  | Yes | or restrictions Yes | >72 hours after exposure (but MMR within 72 hours preferred) Yes | Do not vaccinate if too late for prophylactic MMR (i.e. >72 hours after exposure)2 Yes | Get a dose of MMR | Draw blood for serum IgG titer and then give a dose of MMR.

It is considered one of the most highly communicable infectious diseases, with an attack rate of $90 %$ in susceptible, exposed individuals in a close contact setting. Measles is rare in the United States; however, it is still common in many areas of the world, and sporadic cases and outbreaks of measles in the U.S. often involve individuals who recently traveled to measles-endemic regions or who were exposed to imported cases of measles. Most measles cases in the United States occur in people who are not vaccinated against measles.\n\nThis document consolidates measles guidance from different CDC resources for use by health department staff and other partners involved in measles case investigations and outbreak response. The recommendations in this document are intended to provide general guidance. Measles cases and outbreaks should be evaluated individually to determine the appropriate steps for measles prevention and control.\n\nQuestions regarding this document can be directed to: Maryland Department of Health Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Outbreak Response Bureau 201 W. Preston St. Baltimore, MD 21201 Ph (410) 767-6700\n\n# I. Measles Overview\n\n# Disease Description\n\nMeasles is typically characterized by a prodrome of high fever, malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. Tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin, followed by a maculopapular rash that appears 3-5 days after first symptoms. The rash usually starts at the hairline and spreads downward to the trunk and lower extremities. Fever often progresses through the early stages of the illness and is typically highest when the rash appears. The rash persists for 5-6 days and then fades in order of appearance.\n\nWhile measles is usually a mild or moderately severe illness, it can result in complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Certain individuals are at greater risk of experiencing complications from measles infections, including:\n\nChildren younger than 5 years of age Adults older than 20 years of age Pregnant people People with weakened immune systems\n\n# INCUBATION PERIOD\n\n​ 11 to 12 days from exposure to onset of prodromal symptoms $\\\\mathrm { ~ \\\\mathsf ~ { ~ O ~ } ~ }$ Exposure to rash onset averages 14 days with a range of 7 to 21 days\n\n# MODE OF TRANSMISSION\n\nPerson-to-person via large respiratory droplets Airborne in closed areas for up to 2 hours\n\n# INFECTIOUS PERIOD\n\n4 days before rash onset through 4 days after\n\n# Measles Infection Timeline:\n\n# DAY O: Rash Onset\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| EXPOSUREWINDOW | INFECTIOUS PERIOD | RESOLUTION |\n| Day | -21 -7 | -4 0 | 45+ |\n| Illness | The average incubation period for measles is 11-12 days (from exposure to onset of prodrome). The rash typically appears ~14 days after exposure, with a range of 7-21 days. | The prodrome typically begins 3-5 days before the appearance of the rash. The infectious period starts 4 days prior to rash onset and ends 4 days after. | Symptoms typically start resolving 5-6 days after the rash onset. The rash fades in order of appearance. |\n| Health Dept. Actions | Identify potential exposures that the case had during this timeto determine the likelysourceof infection. Gather information on ill contacts, including a description of illness, testing results or diagnoses, and the nature of contact. Ask about travel history, including travel locations, travel dates, and mode of transportation. | Ensure isolationof thecase.ldentify contactsofthecase duringthe infectious period. Determine the immune statusof contactsand recommend PEP,exclusion ofnonimmunecontacts,and/orsymptom monitoring, as appropriate. | Ensure the exclusion of nonimmune contacts, as indicated. Symptomatic contacts should be evaluated for measles infection. |\n\n# Prevention\n\n# VACCINATION\n\nVaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles infection.\n\nChildren should routinely get two doses of MMR vaccine: one at age 12-15 months and a\n\nsecond at 4-6 years $\\\\mathrm { ~ \\\\mathsf ~ { ~ O ~ } ~ }$ This can be administered as MMR or MMRV vaccine\n\nChildren can receive the second dose of MMR vaccine earlier than 4-6 years of age if it is at\n\nleast 28 days after the first dose\n\nA second dose of MMRV vaccine can be given 3 months after the first dose, up to 12 years\n\nof age\n\nCDC recommends that separate MMR and varicella vaccines be given for the first dose in\n\nchildren aged 12-47 months; however, MMRV may be used if parents or caregivers express\n\na preference\n\nAdults and teens should be up to date on MMR vaccinations with either one or two doses\n\n(depending on risk factors) unless they have other presumptive evidence of immunity (see\n\nbelow) ○​ MMR vaccination (or other evidence of immunity) is especially important for healthcare professionals, international travelers, college students, close contacts of immunocompromised people, people with HIV infection, adults who got inactivated measles vaccine, and groups at increased risk during measles outbreaks\n\n●​ Any clinically significant events, unexpected events following vaccination, and/or events listed on the vaccine manufacturer’s package insert should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nFor more information on measles vaccination, go to CDC Measles Vaccine Recommendations\n\n# Laboratory Tests and Specimen Collection\n\nIndividuals for whom measles is suspected due to clinical presentation and exposure history should be tested for measles.\n\n○​ PCR and serology are the preferred testing methods for measles diagnosis.\n\nA nasopharyngeal (NP) or throat (OP) swab should be collected for PCR testing. A sample for serologic testing should also be collected.\n\nIdeally, upper respiratory specimens should be collected within 3 days of rash onset, but specimens collected after that time may still be tested. IgM is most sensitive $^ { 3 + }$ days after rash onset and may not be detected in specimens collected earlier in the illness.\n\nMDH epidemiologists must approve measles testing before specimens are submitted to the MDH Laboratory. To obtain approval, call 410-767-6700 during business hours. For urgent matters after hours, call 410-795-7365.\n\nSee Table 1 below for more information on specimen collection and submission to the MDH Lab.\n\nTesting asymptomatic persons, including those identified as close contacts of a case, should be avoided as it increases the likelihood of obtaining false positive results.\n\nTable 1: MDH Laboratory Testing for Measles - PCR and Serology\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | PCR | Serology (lgM with IgG) |\n| Time of specimen collection | ldeally,within 3 days of rash onset, but up to 10 days after onset of rash is acceptable. | IgM is most sensitive 3+ days after rash onset and may remain positive for 6-8 weeks; specimens collected <3 days after rash onset may be negative. |\n| Site of specimen collection | Posterior nasopharynx (NP swab) or throat (OP swab) | Serum |\n| Method of collection | NP/OP specimen on Dacron TM swab in viral transport media | 5 mLof whole blood or 4 mL of serum in red-top or gold-top vacutainer |\n| Comments | N/A | IgG can be detected 2+ weeks after vaccination or infection;an lgG-only test may provide evidence of immunity but should not be used (alone) for diagnosing acute measles infection. |\n| Specimen ldentification | Specimens should be labeled with the patient's first and last name,address,and DOB,as well as specimen type/source and the date and time of collection.

Cases must be excluded from school, daycare, healthcare facilities, and workplaces. Cases should remain at home and limit exposure to others.\n\nSuspect measles cases should be isolated until measles has been ruled out or until their presumed infectious period is over.\n\nSuspect or confirmed cases requiring medical attention should notify the healthcare facility prior to arrival so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nCases in healthcare settings must be placed in airborne and standard precautions.\n\n○​ Airborne precautions include isolation in a negative air pressure isolation room, also\n\nknown as airborne infection isolation (AII) or airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). In clinic settings where a negative air pressure isolation room may not be available, a single room with the door closed and away from susceptible contacts may be used when evaluating persons for whom measles is suspected. Suspect or confirmed measles patients should be asked to wear a medical mask.\n\n# IDENTIFICATION OF EXPOSED SUSCEPTIBLE CONTACTS\n\nIndividuals potentially exposed to the case-patient during the infectious period (from four days before rash onset through four days after) should be quickly identified. Note that in a closed setting, the measles virus has been reported to have been transmitted by airborne or droplet exposure up to two hours after the measles case occupied the area. All contacts should be assessed for presumptive evidence of immunity. If the criteria for presumptive evidence of immunity is not met, these individuals should be considered susceptible.\n\n# PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF IMMUNITY\n\nPresumptive evidence of immunity can be established in any of the following ways:\n\nWritten documentation of one or more doses of a measles-containing vaccine administered\n\non or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not considered high-risk\n\nWritten documentation of two doses of measles-containing vaccine for school-age children\n\nand adults at high risk, including students at post-high school secondary educational\n\ninstitutions, healthcare personnel (HCP), and international travelers\n\nLaboratory evidence of immunity\n\nLaboratory confirmation of disease\n\nBirth before 1957\n\nNOTE: Verbal reports of measles vaccination or measles infection without written documentation should not be accepted as presumptive evidence of immunity.\n\nNOTE: Although birth before 1957 is considered acceptable evidence of immunity for HCP in routine circumstances, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating HCP born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. During a measles outbreak, two doses of measles virus-containing vaccine are recommended for all HCP, regardless of year of birth.\n\n# POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nProphylaxis of susceptible household contacts should occur immediately and should not be delayed because of pending laboratory results.\n\nWaiting for laboratory confirmation of measles infection prior to prophylaxis of\n\nnon-household contacts (e.g., schoolmates) may be reasonable in some situations; however, this should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nUse of MMR Vaccine as PEP\n\n○​ Measles vaccine should be provided to exposed susceptible persons who do not have a contraindication to MMR vaccine.\n\n○​ Measles vaccine should be given as soon as possible after the first exposure, and mightbe effective as prophylaxis if given up to 72 hours of the last exposure to measles.\n\n○​ However, vaccine should be administered to susceptible individuals regardless of time since exposure in order to provide protection against subsequent measles exposures.\n\nUse of Immune Globulin (IG) as PEP\n\n○​ If the vaccine cannot be given, IG might be effective as a prophylaxis if administered to susceptible persons within 6 days of their last exposure.\n\n# EXCLUSION OF CONTACTS\n\nAsymptomatic contacts who demonstrate presumptive evidence of immunity do not need to be excluded. For all others:\n\nContacts lacking presumptive evidence of immunity who do not receive appropriate\n\npostexposure prophylaxis within the appropriate time must be excluded from school,\n\nchildcare, healthcare facilities, and workplaces until at least 21 days after the last\n\nexposure to a case during the infectious period:\n\n$\\\\mathrm { ~ \\\\mathsf ~ { ~ O ~ } ~ }$ From schools and childcare until at least 21 days after the onset of rash in the last case identified\n\n○​ From medical settings from the 5th day after first exposure through the 21st day aft last exposure\n\nFor contacts who are HCP and lack presumptive evidence of immunity:\n\n○​ HCP with no prior documented doses of MMR should be offered the first dose of MMR vaccine and should be excluded from work from day 5 after their first measles exposure through day 21 following their last exposure.\n\n○ HCP who received a single dose of MMR vaccine prior to exposure may remain at work and should receive the second dose of MMR vaccine at least 28 days after the first dose.\n\n○ HCP who receive IG as PEP should be excluded from work from the 5th day after their first exposure through the 21st day after their last exposure Contacts who lack presumptive evidence of immunity and who receive vaccine PEP within 72 hours of exposure can be immediately readmitted to childcare, school, or non-healthcare work.\n\nContacts who lack presumptive evidence of immunity and receive IG PEP should be excluded from settings where transmission risk is high (e.g., settings with a large number of susceptible persons or infant care settings). Exclusion should last at least 21 days, and ideally 28 days, following the last exposure to a case during the infectious period.\n\nContacts who develop signs or symptoms of measles, regardless of evidence of immunity or receipt of PEP, should be excluded from school, childcare, healthcare facilities, and workplaces, until evaluated further.\n\n# SYMPTOM MONITORING\n\nAll contacts (regardless of evidence of immunity or receipt of PEP) should monitor for\n\nmeasles signs and symptoms for at least 21 days after the last measles exposure. ○​ Individuals who receive IG PEP should monitor for 28 days after last measles exposure (because receipt of IG PEP may prolong the duration of the incubation period of measles)\n\nNote that previously vaccinated individuals may have a modified disease presentation.\n\nIf signs or symptoms develop, contacts should be instructed to contact their local health department by phone. If the individual requires an in-person medical evaluation, the local health department should call ahead to alert the healthcare facility.\n\n# Outbreaks\n\nA measles outbreak is defined as two or more epidemiologically linked cases occurring within a 42-day period, AND at least one case is laboratory-confirmed. During a measles outbreak, follow the investigation steps and control measures for each identified case. Further response measures (e.g., facility-wide or public communications, additional vaccination, and exclusion recommendations) will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nActive surveillance should be maintained for at least two incubation periods (42 days) after the last reported confirmed case to ensure that all cases are identified before the outbreak investigation closes.\n\n# References\n\n1.​ American Academy of Pediatrics.

This is followed by a red rash that may look like small bumps and last for 5-6 days. The rash usually begins on the head and then spreads to the neck, torso, arms, and legs. The rash usually appears 14 days after a person is exposed.\n\nMeasles is spread through the air and can even be spread in a closed area (e.g., a classroom) up to two hours after the person with measles has left the area. A person with measles can spread the disease from four days before a rash appears until four days after the rash appears. There is no specific treatment for measles.\n\nPersons suspected of having measles must stay home from school/daycare/work for 4 days after the rash appears. Exposed, unvaccinated students and staff should receive a dose of vaccine as soon as possible. Those unvaccinated students and staff who receive a measles-containing vaccine will be allowed back to school immediately. Unvaccinated students and staff who do not receive a measles-containing vaccine due to medical or religious reasons will be excluded from school/work until 21 days after the onset of rash in the last case of measles.\n\nMeasles can be prevented with appropriate vaccination. Please check with your healthcare provider to make sure your/your child’s shots are up to date.\n\nAttached is a Measles Fact Sheet. If you/your child experience(s) measles symptoms during the next several weeks, please contact your healthcare provider and let them know about a possible exposure to measles before going into the office to be evaluated. If you/your child has been seen by a healthcare provider and been diagnosed with measles, please notify us and stay home. If you or your healthcare provider has any questions, please contact (POC at facility/school/daycare) at (###-###-####) or the (local health department) at (###-###- ####).\n\nSincerely, Name of Facility/School/Childcare and LHD",
