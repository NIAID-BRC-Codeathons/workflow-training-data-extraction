Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSubjective Cognitive Decline Among Adults Aged 45 Years  United States, 20152016 Christopher A. Taylor, PhD1; Erin D. Bouldin, PhD1, 2; Lisa C. McGuire, PhD1 Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the self-reported expe - rience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss within the previous 12 months (1, 2) and one of the earliest noticeable symptoms of Alzheimers disease (Alzheimers), a fatal form of dementia (i. e. , a decline in mental abilities severe enough to interfere with everyday life) (1) . Alzheimers is the most common form of dementia, although not all memory loss results from Alzheimers (3) . To examine SCD, CDC analyzed combined data from the 2015 and 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. Overall, 11. 2% of adults aged 45 years reported having SCD, 50. 6% of whom reported SCD-related functional limitations. Among persons living alone aged 45 years, 13. 8% reported SCD; among persons with any chronic disease, 15. 2% reported SCD. Adults should discuss confusion or memory loss with a health care professional who can assess cognitive decline and address possible treatments and issues related to chronic disease management, medical care, and caregiving. BRFSS is a state-based, random-digitdialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years in all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and several U. S. territories. * The six-question cognitive decline module (optional for states in 2015 and 2016) examines how SCD affects the life of respondents aged 45 years, including difficulties performing activities or caring for themselves. Overall, 49 states (all except Pennsylvania), Puerto Rico, and DC administered the module in one or both years. For five states that administered the module in both years, only 2016 data were included in this analysis. For the BRFSS surveys in 2015 and 2016, the overall combined landline and cellular * https: //www. cdc. gov/brfss. telephone response rates among states, Puerto Rico, and DC ranged from 30. 7% to 65. 0% (median = 47. 1%) .  Respondents who answered affirmatively to the question During the past 12 months, have you experienced confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting worse? were classified as having SCD. Respondents with SCD were asked if SCD caused them to give up day-to-day activities such as cooking, cleaning, taking medications, driv - ing, or paying bills; how often they needed and could receive necessary assistance with those activities; how often SCD interfered with their ability to work, volunteer, or engage in social activities; and whether they had discussed SCD with a health care professional.

Data were examined by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, edu - cation level, veteran status, employment, and living alone. Chronic disease status was ascertained by history of heart disease; stroke, or cerebrovascular disease; asthma; lung dis - ease; cancer (other than skin); arthritis; or diabetes. Data were analyzed using statistical software and methods that accounted for the complex survey design and weighted data. Prevalence rates were unadjusted. Among adults aged 45 years, 11. 2% reported SCD, 50. 6% of whom reported SCD-related functional difficulties (Table 1) . SCD prevalence increased with age, from 10. 4% among adults aged 4554 years to 14. 3% among those aged 75 years and was lower among college graduates (7. 0%) than among those with less than high school education (18. 2%) . The prevalence of SCD-related functional difficulties among college graduates (30. 8%) was half that of those without a high school diploma (64. 9%) . Among persons living alone, 13. 8% reported SCD; 55. 7% of those reported SCD-related functional difficulties (Table 1) . The prevalence of SCD varied by state (Table 2) . The lowest prevalence of SCD was reported in South Dakota (6. 0%), and the highest was reported in Nevada (16. 3%) . Nearly twice the percentage of persons reporting SCDrelated functional limitations had talked to a health care professional (58. 1%) compared with those without functional limitations (30. 4%) (Table 3) . Among persons with a func - tional difficulty, 81. 1% reported having given up household activities or chores because of SCD, and 73. 3% reported that SCD interfered with their ability to work, volunteer, or engage in social activities. Discussion SCD can be a symptom of early-stage dementia conditions, including Alzheimers (1, 2) . Not everyone who reports SCD will develop dementia, but some studies have shown that half of older adults with subjective memory complaints go on to develop more severe cognitive decline within 718 years (1, 4, 5) . Even without progression to more severe cognitive impairment, SCD might signify a decreased ability for self-care. Inability to perform activities important to daily living such as preparing meals or managing money affect the ability to live independently and might also affect the ability to socialize or remain fully employed. These findings are similar to those from an analysis of per - sons aged 60 years in 21 states from the 2011 BRFSS survey, which found a 12. 7% prevalence of SCD (6) . In that study, the highest prevalence was among Hispanics (16. 9%) and the lowest was among non-Hispanic blacks (11. 8%), in contrast to the current study, which found the highest prevalence among non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives (19. 6%) and the lowest among non-Hispanic Asians or Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders (6. 8%) .

In both 2011 (6) and 20152016, a higher SCD prevalence was found among adults aged 75 years than among those aged 4574 years. This is similar to the prevalence of Alzheimers, according to 2018 data from the Alzheimers Association, which found an estimated 3% of persons aged 6574 years, 17% of persons aged 7584 years, and 32% of persons aged 85 years had Alzheimers (1, 7) . This analysis found a higher prevalence of SCD and related functional limitations in per - sons with less formal education, similar to previously reported patterns of higher dementia prevalence in persons with less formal education (8) . Younger adults might be more likely to attribute limitations in their lifestyle to SCD or might be more sensitive to its effects. Conversely, older adults might be less aware of the effects of SCD or consider it a normal part of aging. Among persons aged 4554 years, 10. 4% reported SCD, and 59. 8% of those persons reported SCD-related limitations that affected work, household chores, or social activities. Although Alzheimers is rare in persons aged <65 years, the finding of SCD and related functional limitations among younger adults could indicate early symptoms of cognitive decline that can be a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 756 MMWR / July 13, 2018 / V ol. 67 / No. 27 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 2.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a form of impairment in which more frequent or worsening confusion or memory loss can affect the ability to care for oneself. What is added by this report? Among adults aged 45 years, 11. 2% reported SCD, including 10. 4% of adults aged 4554 years. Among all persons who reported SCD, only 45. 4% had discussed it with a health care professional. What are the implications for public health practice? Adults with confusion or memory loss should talk to a health care professional who can assess cognitive decline and address possible treatment of symptoms, management of other co-occurring chronic health conditions, advance care planning, and caregiving needs, and who ensures that the patient receives appropriate information and referrals. precursor to memory disorders and dementia like Alzheimers. These functional limitations might have important health and economic impacts. Adults aged 4554 years are in their prime working years, when salaries peak, workers are most produc - tive, and when workers contribute to their retirements and consume goods and services (9) . An inability to work during these years might have financial implications for these adults and their families. Persons with SCD-related functional limi-tations might have to reduce their time working or leave the workforce entirely; in this study, nearly three fourths of those with a functional difficulty reported that SCD interfered with their ability to engage in activities outside the home, includ-ing working. Fewer than half (45. 4%) of respondents with SCD reported speaking to a health care professional about it. More than half of those with SCD-related functional limitations reported speaking to a health care professional about SCD compared with fewer than one third of persons without such limitations, suggesting that limitations in ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living might prompt discussion with a health care professional. Persons might incorrectly believe that cogni - tive decline is an inevitable part of aging, which could discourage them from consulting a health care professional. CDC encourages persons with confusion or memory loss to talk to a health care professional. After evaluation, even if treatment of symptoms is not an option, early assessment of cognitive issues can facilitate addressing potential safety issues, discussion of advanced care planning, including the need for caregiving, and ensuring receipt of appropriate information and referrals (10) . Early assessment is important because memory issues can affect a persons ability to manage their health; among those reporting other chronic health conditions, 15. 2% also had SCD.

Always, usually, or sometimes.  By definition. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data on SCD are self-reported. Whereas the SCD module was cognitively tested, it is not administered alongside an objective measure of cognitive performance. Therefore, the accuracy of the reports of SCD is unknown. Second, response bias might affect response to SCD questions and might underestimate SCD prevalence. Finally, BRFSS is not administered to persons with known cognitive problems who might not generate reliable data. In addition, BRFSS is only administered to noninstitutionalized adults, excluding adults living in long-term care facilities, where a proportion of residents have SCD. Therefore, these results cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of SCD across all U. S. populations. Cognitive decline is an important public health issue affect - ing older adults, their families, and their caregivers, as well as the economy and health care system. As a precursor to dementia, including Alzheimers, SCD can impair a persons ability to care for themselves by limiting their ability to work, particularly those adults who report SCD in their prime working years (i. e. , 4554 years) . Estimating the prevalence of SCD might allow states to plan for those who might develop dementia in the future.

To examine trends in youth hyper - tension and the impact of the new guideline on classification of hypertension status, CDC analyzed data from 12, 004 par - ticipants aged 1219 years in the 20012016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) . During this time, prevalence of hypertension declined, using both the new (from 7. 7% to 4. 2%, p<0. 001) and former (from 3. 2% to 1. 5%, p<0. 001) guidelines, and declines were observed across all weight status categories. However, because of the new percentile tables and lower threshold for hypertension (4), application of the new guideline compared with the for - mer guideline resulted in a weighted net estimated increase of 795, 000 U. S. youths being reclassified as having hypertension using 20132016 data. Youths who were older, male, and those with obesity accounted for a disproportionate share of persons reclassified as having hypertension. Clinicians and public health professionals might expect to see a higher prevalence of hypertension with application of the new guideline and can use these data to inform actions to address hypertension among youths. Strategies to improve cardiovascular health include adoption of healthy eating patterns and increased physical activity (3) . NHANES is a nationally representative survey of noninsti - tutionalized persons in the United States. The survey includes an in-person examination with up to three brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings taken by certified examiners. Mean SBP and DBP values were used.  Among 13, 523 participating youths during * https: //www. nhlbi. nih. gov/files/docs/peds_guidelines_sum. pdf.

A maximum of thr ee blood pressure readings were measured for each participant in the Mobile Examination Center under a standard protocol. For participants with only a single BP reading, that measurement was used in place of an average. https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/Phys_Exam_ Manual_2013. pdf. 20012016, those missing SBP or DBP (999), or body mass index (BMI [kg/m2]) (136) were excluded. In addition, youths classified as underweight (BMI-for-age <5th percentile; 384) were excluded because of insufficient sample size, leaving 12, 004 persons aged 1219 years in the analytic sample. Elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension were defined according to age-specific thresholds established in both the former and new guidelines. To apply the former guideline, among those aged 1217 years, elevated BP (formerly prehy - pertension) was defined as BP 90th to <95th percentile or 120/80 mmHg to <95th percentile; hypertension was defined as BP 95th percentile (using 2004 age, sex, and height-specific percentile tables) or reported antihypertensive medication use (only available for persons aged >15 years) (Supplementary Table 1, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/56579) . Among persons aged 1819 years, elevated BP was defined as SBP 120 mmHg to <140 mmHg or DBP 80 mmHg to <90 mmHg; hypertension was defined as BP 140/90 mmHg or reported antihypertensive medication use. The new guideline used new percentile tables (from a refer - ence population excluding youths with overweight/obesity) . To apply the new guideline, among adolescents aged 1217 years, elevated BP was defined as BP 90th to <95th percentile or SBP 120 mmHg to <95th percentile; hypertension was defined as BP 95th percentile, BP 130/80 mmHg, or reported antihypertensive medication use. For persons aged 1819 years, elevated BP was defined as SBP 120 mmHg to <130 mmHg and DBP <80 mmHg; hypertension was defined as BP 130/80 mmHg or antihypertensive medication use. The new guideline thresholds for persons aged 1819 years align  From NHANES Prescription Medication dataset, unpublished. The definition of hypertension used in this analysis did not include medications identified as being antihypertensives in the Prescription Medication dataset (in which interviewers asked to see all prescription medication containers for medications that the participant had taken within 30 days), because some of these medications might not have been taken for the purpose of controlling hypertension. Hypertension in this analysis only included self-reported antihypertensive use from the Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Module (e. g. , Because of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you ever been told to take prescribed medicine?) . However, use of medications identified as being antihypertensives in the Prescription Medication dataset increased from 2001 to 2014, the last year for which this dataset was available.

D uring 19992006, certain groups, including Mexican Americans, were oversampled, while the number of non-Mexican American Hispanics in the NHANES sample was too small for reliable estimates. Because of these sampling differences and sample size concerns, it is not recommended to examine all Hispanics from years before 2007. Hispanics other than Mexican Americans were included in the other category. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/ data/nhanes/analyticnote_2007-2010. pdf. 2016, population-level estimates of the number of youths classified as having hypertension were calculated. Bootstrap methodology with 1, 000 resamples was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals for the percentage of the population reclas - sified as having hypertension. All analyses used exam sample weights and statistical procedures for complex surveys, and all tests were two-sided. Population characteristics were mostly consistent from 2001 to 2016, although the prevalence of obesity increased from 17. 8% (20012004) to 21. 8% (20132016) (p = 0. 016), as did the prevalence of severe obesity (5. 7% to 8. 8%, p = 0. 003) (Table 1) . During 20012016, the prevalence of hypertension declined, according to both the new (from 7. 7% to 4. 2%, p<0. 001) and former (from 3. 2% to 1. 5%, p<0. 001) guidelines (Figure) (Supplementary Table 2, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/ cdc/56580) . This decline occurred across all BMI categories, although the prevalence of hypertension was consistently highest among persons with obesity and severe obesity. During 20132016, using the new guideline, the prevalence of elevated BP was approximately 10%, and the prevalence of combined elevated BP or hypertension was nearly 15% (Figure) . Compared with the former guideline, the new guideline classified fewer youths with elevated BP and more youths as having hypertension (Figure) . Using data from 2013 to 2016, an additional 2. 6% of U. S. youths aged 1219 years would be reclassified as having hypertension, which translates to a net increase of approximately 795, 000 persons (Table 2) .

Nearly half of the net increase in new diagnoses of hypertension among youths would be among those with obesity (Table 2), although less than one quarter of U. S. youths have obesity (Table 1) . Discussion According to the criteria of the 2017 AAP Clinical Practice Guideline, approximately one in seven U. S. youths aged 1219 years had elevated BP or hypertension during 2013 2016. Prevalence of hypertension varied by weight status, ranging from 2% among healthy-weight youths to nearly 14% among those with severe obesity. The new guideline used a lower threshold of hypertension and new percentile references, and compared with the former guideline, the new guideline would reclassify 2. 6% of U. S. youths, or nearly an additional 800, 000, as having hypertension. The application of the new guideline results in a net increase in the number of persons aged 1219 years classified as having hypertension. Early screening (3) and intervention should be encouraged. Hypertension among youths is associated with increased risk for hypertension and other markers of cardio - vascular risk during adulthood (1, 2); however, if children with hypertension can achieve normal BP by adulthood, this risk might be reduced (1) . Despite significant increases in the prevalence of obesity and severe obesity from 20012004 to 20132016, the prevalence of hypertension declined signifi - cantly (3. 5 percentage points) across this time. This decline in adolescent hypertension is consistent with other reports (6, 7), and might be related to improved diet quality or improved screening and earlier lifestyle or pharmacologic intervention (8, 9) . Increases in antihypertensive medication use, and subse - quent decreases in BP, might have partially contributed to the observed declines in hypertension. Information on medication use was not available for participants aged 1215 years and thus could not be included in the definition of hypertension for this age group. In addition, there appeared to be an increase in antihypertensive medication use based on review of the participants actual medications, both among youths who self-reported medication use for BP control and were collected in the definition of hypertension, and among youths who did not self-report medication use for BP control and were not included in the definition of hypertension. Although antihypertensive, or BP-lowering, medications are primarily used to manage hypertension, they can also be used for other cardiovascular conditions, migraines, or anxiety.

Those classified as underweight are excluded.  Indicates relative standard error >30%. hypertension prevalence should be interpreted with caution, as the underlying causes of the decline are uncertain (7) . The findings in this report are subject to at least three addi - tional limitations. First, surveys such as NHANES are subject to selection and response bias, which might affect the accuracy of national estimates, despite use of weights and survey pro - cedures. Second, multiple BP measurements were taken on a single day, rather than spread over two or more visits as is recommended for diagnosis (3) . Finally, self-reported medica - tion use data are subject to recall bias. Reducing hypertension prevalence among youths is a Healthy People 2020 objective (HDS-5. 2) .  Lifestyle interventions for youths with elevated BP or hypertension include increased physical activity and adoption of healthy eating pat - terns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (3) . Sodium reduction in the food supply and promotion of physical activity in communities and schools are population strategies for improving cardiovascular health  https: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/heart-diseaseand-stroke/objectives. (10) . Pediatricians, family physicians, public health profession - als, policy makers, parents, and schools can all be involved in efforts to address hypertension in the adolescent population. Summary What is already known about this topic? Elevated blood pressure during adolescence is associated with cardiovascular risk in adulthood. In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a new guideline that changed the criteria for diagnosing hypertension. What is added by this report? Using the new guideline, an estimated 800, 000 additional youths aged 1219 years (especially older youths, males, and those with obesity) would be reclassified as having hypertension during 20132016, compared with using the former guideline. What are the implications for public health practice? Clinicians and researchers transitioning to the new guideline might expect more youths to be classified as having hyperten - sion. Efforts to address hypertension in youths include lifestyle and environmental strategies that promote cardiovascular health.

Lafferty, PhD3; Robert Thiboldeaux, PhD2; Carrie Tomasallo, PhD2; Barbara Grajewski, PhD2; Ryan Wozniak, PhD2; Jonathan Meiman, MD2 On May 9, 2017, Public Health Madison & Dane County contacted the Wisconsin Division of Public Health for assis - tance with investigation of mercury exposure among workers at a fluorescent lamp recycling facility. Public Health Madison & Dane County had been contacted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources as part of an investigation of potential environmental contamination at the facility. Fluorescent lamps are composed of a phosphor-coated glass tube containing mercury vapor and argon. During the recy - cling process, lamps are crushed, releasing mercury vapor and mercury-containing dusts. State and county health officials, in collaboration with Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, conducted an investigation of mercury exposure of workers and an environmental assessment of the facility, surrounding areas, and worker vehicles. All five workers who were tested had urine mercury levels exceeding the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) biologic exposure index of 20. 0 g/g creatinine, and two had tremor on physical exam. Workers wore inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) . Mercury levels in indoor air var - ied within the building, with a maximum of 207. 4 g/m 3 at floor level on the crushing platform, approximately eightfold higher than the ACGIH threshold limit value of 25 g/m 3 (1) . Mercury also was found in workers vehicles, indicating risk for take-home exposure. Workers at risk for mercury exposure need to have access to and consistently wear National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) -approved respi - ratory protection for mercury vapor, nitrile or other suitable gloves to prevent contact exposure, and disposable suits with booties and change shoes before leaving the worksite to prevent take-home exposures. On May 12, 2017, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, Public Health Madison & Dane County, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducted a facility site visit to assess the work environment, interview workers, and perform environmental monitoring. Workers were advised to be tested for mercury exposure, and spot urine testing was offered at the time of the site visit. A case of mercury exposure was defined as a urine spot mercury level above the ACGIH biologic exposure index of 20. 0 g/g creatinine in a facility worker. T wenty-fourhour urine samples were not obtained because of potential contamination at the work site during urine collection. Workers who received a diagnosis of mer - cury exposure were referred to an occupational health clinic for further evaluation. All workers were asked to participate in a survey that included employment history, symptoms of mercury toxicity, PPE use, and medical and social history. The 6, 000square-foot lamp recycling facility consisted of a large storage area with offices and kitchenette at the front and a break room at the back. A processing area with a drum-type crusher was located on one side of the storage area, and a bay door opened from the outside into the storage area on the opposite side. Ambient air sampling of the facility was conducted using a Lumex RA-915+ mercury vapor analyzer (Ohio Lumex Co. , Inc.) . Because of the timing of the unan-nounced visit, sampling was conducted when the facility was not processing; the bay door was open during sampling. Mercury vapors were measured just above floor level to assess spilled mercury and phosphor powder and at breathing height (approximately 45 feet above floor level) to assess worker exposure levels. The processing platform was approximately 4-feet high. All areas of the facility were sampled, including the facility entrance, reception area, office, kitchenette, hallways, bathroom, lockers, break room, and processing floor. Potential for take-home mercury exposure was assessed by wipe-sampling workers vehicle foot pedals on June 20. All workers declined assessment of their homes for mercury contamination. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources sampled water and fish from two nearby ponds on May 25 and June 19 to evaluate potential contamination from the facility. Seven persons worked at the facility, including the owner-man - ager and six persons who worked in processing, administration, or as drivers. Workers mean age was 35 years (range = 2350 years), six of seven workers were male, and mean duration of employ - ment at the facility was 2 years (range = 05 years) . Five workers had worked at the facility for a previous owner who had been cited by OSHA for elevated air mercury levels and failure to use respirators after an investigation on September 2, 2016. Appropriate respirators with mercury vapor cartridges were provided to workers after that investigation. Spot urine samples were obtained from four of the seven workers; a fifth workers spot urine sample was obtained 1 week later. T wo workers declined testing. All five tested workers met the case definition for mercury exposure; the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 764 MMWR / July 13, 2018 / V ol. 67 / No. 27 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionaverage urine mercury/creatinine ratio was 49. 6 g/g creatinine (range: >23. 871. 2 g/g creatinine) . Follow-up during June September 2017 for three workers evaluated at an occupational health clinic and one evaluated at a primary care clinic included repeat spot urines and 24-hour urine collections (Table 1) . Repeat testing showed a decrease in mercury levels in urine, blood, or both for two workers and indeterminate results in one worker. One worker continued to have elevated blood and urine mercury levels indicative of continued exposure. Four workers completed the survey. The symptom most commonly reported was breathing difficulty (reported by all four workers), followed by memory loss, irritability, insomnia, headaches, and weakness (three of four) . No worker reported difficulty walking. One worker reported tremor, and another reported muscle twitches. T wo of three processing workers wore rubber gloves, respira - tors, goggles, and disposable coveralls only while processing; the third wore only cloth gloves. Only one worker wore booties. One worker said he only started wearing PPE within the past month. No workers changed clothes or shoes before leaving the facility. Three workers attended an occupational health appointment with a physician during the 5 months after the initial investigation. One patient had no physical findings of mercury toxicity, one had tremor of the hands and head, and one had tremor of the fingers and a Mini Mental Status Exam score of 27/30 (normal >24/30) . No prior Mini Mental Status Exam score was available for comparison. Spot air sampling found mercury vapor concentrations of 0. 26. 8 g/m 3 outside of processing areas, with differences of up to 1 g/m3 between ground level and breathing height measurements; higher mercury levels at the ground were reported, compared with breathing height (Table 2) . Inside the processing area, mercury levels were 9. 0 g/m 3 at the entrance and reached a maximum of 207. 4 g/m3 on the floor of the processing platform and 99. 7 g/m3 at breathing level on the processing platform ramp. Wipe samples from the cars of two workers determined the presence of mercury, indicating a risk for take-home exposure. Samples of water and fish from two nearby ponds found mer - cury levels consistent with regional freshwater mercury levels. Discussion Workers at the lamp recycling facility were exposed to mercury in the air, had elevated urine mercury levels, and experienced signs and symptoms of mercury toxicity. Previous investigations have reported that 33% of mercury is released from bulbs in the first 8 hours after breakage (2), and that processing in an open area decreases exposure (3) . According to a U. S. Department of Energy report, approximately 3. 8 billion fluorescent lamps were installed in the United States during 2010 (4) . Recycling used fluorescent lamps prevents release of mercury and other metals into the environment and allows reclamation of materials for reuse. Wisconsin state law requires businesses and institutions to recycle used fluorescent bulbs (5) . The risk for mercury exposure in the manufacturing of fluorescent lamps has been known since the first investigation of a fluorescent lamp manufacturer in 1965 reported elevated urine mercury levels among glass blowers who made and repaired lamps (6) . However, risks associated with fluorescent lamp recycling have not been well documented. A case study reported membranous nephropathy and elevated mercury levels in two workers at a fluorescent lamp recycling facility TABLE 1.

(7), and two studies have demonstrated levels of mercury vapor exceeding OSHA permissible exposure limit during processing of fluorescent lamps using drum-type crushers (3, 8) . In this investigation, environmental measurements likely underestimated workers exposure to mercury because pro - cessing was suspended during the site visit and the bay door was open during sampling. Although the spot environmental mercury vapor concentrations measured in this investigation cannot be directly compared with the time-weighted averages used in OSHA (9), NIOSH (10), and ACGIH (1) guidelines, this investigation indicates increased risk for adverse health effects from mercury exposure to workers in fluorescent lamps recycling facilities, with potential for take-home exposure and environmental contamination. Despite changes implemented after the 2016 OSHA investigation that included access to correct respirators, workers did not consistently use PPE and had elevated mercury levels. To mitigate risks to workers, employers need to implement engineering control technology and housekeeping (mercury appropriate vacuum, regular clean - ing of surfaces with correct disposal of cleaning equipment) to reduce mercury contamination at their facilities. A clear protection program policy needs to be provided, and workers Summary What is already known about this topic? The risk for mercury exposure from manufacture of fluorescent lights has been known for many years; risks for exposure from recycling are not well documented. What is added by this report? An investigation of environmental contamination at a fluorescent light recycling facility in Wisconsin in 2017 found elevated mercury levels among five of seven workers and clinical signs of mercury toxicity in two. Use of personal protective equipment was inconsistent, and mercury levels for inside air exceeded recommended thresholds. What are the implications for public health practice? Employers at fluorescent light recycling facilities need to implement control technology, housekeeping, and exposure monitoring, and provide recommended PPE and training to their workers to reduce mercury exposures at their facilities. need to receive training in PPE and wear the PPE needed for their task. In addition to reducing mercury exposure with engineering and administrative controls, regular mercury control housekeeping needs to be used. Periodic monitoring can be considered to ensure employee exposures remain within existing recommended limits.

Matthew Gladden, PhD1; Christine L. Mattson, PhD1; Mbabazi Kariisa, PhD1 Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are increasingly involved in opioid overdose deaths, and new fentanyl analogs continue to be identified (1) . Carfentanil, the most potent fentanyl analog detected in the United States, is intended for sedation of large animals and is estimated to have 10, 000 times the potency of morphine (2) . It has recently been reported in an alarming number of deaths in some states. Ohio reported nearly 400 carfentanil-involved deaths during JulyDecember 2016, and Florida reported >500 such deaths for all of 2016 (3, 4) . CDC funds 32 states and the District of Columbia (DC) to abstract detailed data on opioid overdose deaths from death certificates and medical examiner and coroner reports through the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) . T welve states began reporting in August 2017, and 20 states and DC will begin reporting in August 2018. * CDC analyzed trends in overdose deaths testing positive for carfen - tanil and other fentanyl analogs during July 2016June 2017 in 10 SUDORS states (Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) .  States abstract data on all substances (both opioids and nonopioids) that contributed to death, as well as all substances for which the decedent tested positive. * CDC s Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) program funded 12 states through a competitive application process in fiscal year 2016 and an additional 32 states and the District of Columbia in fiscal year 2017. States are funded to collect and share data on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. The State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) is the component of ESOOS that collects data on fatal opioid overdoses. https: //www. cdc. gov/drugoverdose/foa/state-opioid-mm. html.  D ata for the period from July 2016 through June 2017 were collected only by the 12 states that began reporting in August 2017 (Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) . At the time of reporting, data for Missouri and Pennsylvania were not complete and were therefore excluded.  SUDORS estimates of opioid-inv olved overdose deaths might differ from those of the National Vital Statistics System because SUDORS uses preliminary death certificate data and collects additional information from medical examiner and coroner reports, which are abstracted within 8 months of death. In SUDORS, an opioid-involved overdose death either was identified through review of the medical examiner/coroner report or had International Classification of Disease, T enth Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X4044 (unintentional) or Y10Y14 (undetermined) and multiple cause-of-death codes of T40. 0, T40. 1, T40. 2, T40. 3, T40. 4, or T40. 6 on the death certificate. Data for this report were downloaded on April 25, 2018, and might differ from reports using earlier data. During July 2016June 2017, among 11, 045 opioid over - dose deaths, 2, 275 (20. 6%) decedents tested positive for any fentanyl analog, and 1, 236 (11. 2%) tested positive for carfentanil. Fourteen different fentanyl analogs were detected. Among overdose deaths with fentanyl analogs detected, the analogs were determined by medical examiners or coroners to have contributed to the death in >95% of deaths. During the first half of 2017, the number of deaths with any fentanyl analog detected (1, 511) nearly doubled, compared with the number during the second half of 2016 (764); deaths with carfentanil detected increased 94%, from 421 to 815. The pro - portions of deaths with any fentanyl analog or with carfentanil detected nearly doubled during this period. Ohio reported the largest numbers and most substantial increases in deaths with any fentanyl analog detected, including carfentanil (Figure) . The number of carfentanil deaths in Ohio initially peaked in September 2016 (86 deaths), decreased dur - ing October 2016February 2017, and peaked again in April 2017 (218 deaths) . Changes in the number of deaths with any fentanyl analog detected mirrored changes in deaths with carfentanil detected, except during October 2016February 2017, when deaths with carfentanil decreased. During this period, the number of deaths with any fentanyl analog detected instead increased, mainly driven by acrylfentanyl (202 deaths) and furanylfentanyl (192 deaths) . The number of deaths with carfentanil present in other states followed a similar pattern, with peaks occurring slightly after those in Ohio. During the first half of 2017, seven states reported detecting carfentanil in overdose deaths, compared with three during the second half of 2016; the number of counties in which overdose deaths with carfentanil present occurred increased from 54 to 77. In 2015, CDC issued a nationwide public health advisory about increases in fentanyl-related overdose deaths in multiple states (5), and in 2016 issued an update to that advisory to warn about increasing availability of fentanyl and fentanylrelated substances being pressed into counterfeit pills, and the potential for broad distribution across the United States (6) . In response to findings in SUDORS data, on July 11, 2018, CDC issued a second update highlighting the emerging  F entanyl analogs detected in at least one death: 3-methylfentanyl, 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl, 4-fluorofentanyl, 4-fluoroisobutyrfentanyl, acetylfentanyl, acrylfentanyl, butyrylfentanyl, carfentanil, cyclopropylfentanyl, cyclopentylfentanyl, furanylethylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, isobutyrylfentanyl, and tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl. Decedents might have tested positive for more than one analog, as well as for other opioid and nonopioid substances. Multiple substances could have been used separately or mixed together, either with or without the decedents knowledge.

Growing outbreaks associated with fentanyl ana - logs are occurring at a time when sharp increases in fentanyl overdose deaths are already straining the capacity of medical examiner and coroner offices and public health departments. The increasing array of fentanyl analogs highlights the need to build forensic toxicological testing capabilities to identify and report emerging threats and to enhance capacity to rapidly respond to evolving drug trends. The highly potent nature of many analogs, particularly carfentanil, might warrant mul - tiple administrations of the effective opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone.

Lynch, PhD3; Maulik Shah, MD4; Craig G. Smollin, MD1, 2; Paul D. Blanc, MD1, 5 During the early morning of October 10, 2017, a California man aged 24 years was noted to be lethargic with slurred speech; at 2: 30 p. m. , he was found unresponsive. Emergency medical services transported him to an emergency depart - ment. The patient had a 2-year history of tianeptine misuse. Tianeptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant that enhances serotonin uptake, increases dopamine signaling, modulates glutamate signaling, and stimulates mu () and delta () opioid receptors (1, 2) . Tianeptine is taken for its anxiolytic, mood-enhancement, and euphoric effects (3) . The patient had recent concomitant misuse of phenibut (-Phenyl--aminobutyric acid), a central nervous system depressant. Neither tianeptine nor phenibut is licensed in the United States; both were pur - chased online. The patients medical history included sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (treated with methylphenidate) . He occasionally misused prescription benzodiazepines and opiates, reportedly taken from family members. Upon hospitalization, the patient was comatose but with intact brainstem reflexes and was intubated because of a low respiratory rate. An initial urine toxicology screen was positive only for marijuana. T wo days after admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated diffuse white matter dam - age characteristic of toxic leukoencephalopathy. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care facility. On October 15, repeat MRI imaging confirmed leukoencephalopathy involv - ing almost the entire supratentorial white matter. The patients neurologic status deteriorated with development of prolonged extensor and flexor posturing and loss of brainstem reflexes; he died 19 days after his initial admission. Serum from October 10 was tested for a range of exogenous substances by liquid chromatographyhigh resolution mass spectrometry. The tianeptine level was 3, 000 ng/mL (therapeu - tic range = 278366 ng/mL) (3); phenibut was undetectable. Benzodiazepines and their metabolites within therapeutic ranges included clonazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, midazolam, and alpha-hydroxymidazolam. Also detected were the central nervous system stimulant methylphenidate; tetrahydrocan-nabinol (THC) (the psychoactive constituent of cannabis); and its metabolite, hydroxyl-THC. The comprehensive blood testing and the initial urine screen were negative for opiates. Given the role of tianeptine in this patients outcome, and its potential for public health impact, an adverse event report has been filed with the Food and Drug Administration. Tianeptine overdose fatalities are associated with serum concentrations ranging from 4, 000 to 18, 000 ng/mL (4) . Tianeptine dependence and a withdrawal syndrome of anxiety, sweating, myalgias, chills, and depression have been described (2) . This is the first known case of toxic leukoencephalopathy reported associated with tianeptine. Toxic leukoencephalopa - thy can be distinguished from leukoencephalopathy associated with hypoxia by delayed onset and by radiographic features. Other illicit toxicants have been associated with acute toxic leu - koencephalopathy, including inhalation of heroin combustion byproducts (chasing the dragon) (5) . The patients tianeptine use, with a blood concentration an order of magnitude higher than therapeutic levels, implicates it in this patients acute illness and findings although this does not confirm causality. The absence of supratherapeutic levels of other pharmaceuti - cals reduces the likelihood that they directly led to leukoen - cephalopathy although drug interactions cannot be excluded as contributors. The negative urine and blood testing for opiates and the absence of a history of heroin inhalation make this an unlikely etiology for the leukoencephalopathy in this case. Other pharmaceuticals have been implicated in toxic leuko - encephalopathy, further precluding any definitive etiological conclusion based on a single observation. Nevertheless, this case highlights the potential of tianeptine misuse to emerge as a public health issue, whether used alone or in the context of polysubstance use. Health care providers should be aware of tianeptine misuse, including its potential link to severe adverse outcomes.

The percentage of men told by a health professional that their cholesterol was high who were taking lipid-lowering medications increased from 36% in 20052006 to 50% in 20152016 among those aged 60 years but not among those aged 2039 years (1% to 2%) or 4059 years (16% to 17%) . The percentage taking lipid-lowering medications also increased (from 33% to 38%) among women aged 60 years but not among women aged 2039 years (1% to 0. 7%) or 4059 years (from 13% to 11%) . For each survey year from 20052006 to 20152016, the percentage of both men and women with high cholesterol taking lipid-lowering medications was higher among those aged 60 years than those in younger age groups.
