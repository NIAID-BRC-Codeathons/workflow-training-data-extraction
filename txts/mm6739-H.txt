{"extracted text":"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Weekly / Vol. 67 / No. 39 Oct ober 5, 2018 World Arthritis Day 2018 and National Mental Illness Awareness Week World Arthritis Day* is October 12, 2018, and National Mental Illness Awareness Week is October 713, 2018. World Arthritis Day encourages organizations and individuals to work toward increas - ing awareness about arthritis and other rheumatic con - ditions worldwide. National Mental Illness Awareness Week seeks to educate the public, combat stigma, and provide support to those affected by mental illness. A report in this issue found that adults with arthritis had higher prevalences of symptoms of anxiety (22. 5%) and depression (12. 1%) compared with adults without arthritis (1) . Community-delivered self-management educational programs, such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program,  can increase self-efficacy (confidence) and physical activity (e. g. , walking), improve self-rated health, and reduce depression, fatigue, and pain (2) . CDC works with national and state partners to disseminate these edu - cational programs in communities. References 1. Guglielmo D, Hootman JM, Boring MA, et al.

Remington, MD, MPH Carlos Roig, MS, MA William Schaffner, MDaddress these knowledge gaps, CDC analyzed 20152017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data* to estimate the national prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression among adults aged 18 years with arthritis. Among adults with arthritis, age-standardized prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depression were 22. 5% and 12. 1%, respectively, compared with 10. 7% and 4. 7% among adults without arthritis. Successful treatment approaches to address anxiety and depression among adults with arthritis are mul-tifaceted and include screenings, referrals to mental health professionals, and evidence-based strategies such as regular physical activity and participation in self-management educa - tion to improve mental health. NHIS is an ongoing, in-person, cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U. S. population. CDC analyzed combined NHIS data from 2015, 2016, and 2017 from the Sample Adult component of the survey, in which one adult is randomly selected from each family for whom additional information is collected. Response rates for the 3 years of surveys ranged from 53. 0% to 55. 2% and produced a 3-year sample of 93, 442 participants. A randomly selected subset of approximately half of the sample adults (46, 742) completed the Adult Functioning and Disability supplement over the 3-year period. Having arthritis was defined as a yes response to the question Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health * https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nhis/data-questionnaires-documentation. htm. care professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia? The Adult Functioning and Disability supplement included questions about symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents were classified as having symptoms of anxiety or depression if they reported the respective symptoms daily or weekly and responded that the last time they experienced symptoms, the intensity was a lot or in between a little and a lot.  These definitions identified adults whose symp - toms would likely meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) diagnostic criteria and also would be clinically managed, which are referred to in this report as clinically relevant, although these definitions are not clini - cal diagnoses. , The final unweighted sample sizes for those  Respondents were classified based on a frequency question (anxiety: How often do you feel worried, nervous or anxious? and depression: How often do you feel depressed?) and an intensity question (anxiety: Thinking about the last time you felt worried, nervous or anxious, how would you describe the level of these feelings? and depression: Thinking about the last time you felt depressed, how depressed did you feel?) . Respondents were classified as having symptoms if they responded daily or weekly to the frequency question and a lot or in between a little and a lot to the intensity question. Respondents were classified as not having symptoms if they responded daily or weekly to the frequency question and a little to the intensity question, or if they responded monthly, a few times a year, or never to the frequency question. For each symptom, the remaining respondents were excluded from the analysis because their symptom status could not be identified.  https: //dsm. psychiatryonline. org/doi/full/10. 1176/appi. books. 9780890425596. dsm04.  https: //dsm. psychiatryonline. org/doi/full/10. 1176/appi. books. 9780890425596. dsm05.

Analyses accounted for the complex survey design, including the use of supplement file sampling weights so that weighted estimates derived from the sample were nationally representative. Age-standardized prevalences (using the 2000 projected U. S. population for persons aged 1844, 4564, and 65 years) ** of symptoms of anxiety and depression were calculated for adults with and without arthritis and groups of those with arthritis who had selected sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Prevalences of speaking with a mental health professional in the past 12 months and currently taking medications for symptoms of anxiety and depression  also were calculated. T-tests were performed to assess statistical significance (p<0. 05) when comparing differences. During 20152017, age-standardized prevalences of symp - toms of anxiety and depression among adults with arthritis were 22. 5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20. 824. 3) and 12. 1% (CI = 10. 813. 4), respectively. Prevalences among adults without arthritis were 10. 7% (CI = 10. 211. 2) and 4. 7% (CI = 4. 45. 0), respectively (Figure 1) . When weighted esti - mates were applied, among adults with arthritis, an estimated 10. 3 million reported symptoms of anxiety or depression; 4. 9 million reported symptoms of anxiety only, 1. 3 million reported symptoms of depression only, and 4. 1 million reported symptoms of both. Among adults with arthritis, age-specific prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depression were higher among adults aged 1844 years than among those aged 65 years; preva - lence of symptoms of anxiety was also higher among adults with arthritis aged 1844 years than adults with arthritis aged 4564 years (Table) . Age-standardized prevalences of symp - toms of anxiety and depression were higher among women than among men; among those who were unemployed, unable to work, or disabled compared with employed adults; and among adults who reported their sexual identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other than among those who reported being heterosexual. Symptom prevalences were lower among adults with higher educational and income-to-poverty ratios. Higher symptom prevalences were reported by adults with chronic pain and arthritis-attributable activity limitations, and prevalences increased with the number of co-occurring chronic conditions, increasing psychological distress, and declining self-rated health. Adults with arthritis who reported aerobic physical activity had lower anxiety and depression symptom prevalences than did inactive adults. Symptom prevalences ** https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20. pdf.  Medication use for each of the anxiety or depression symptoms was ascertained from the question, Do you take medication for these feelings? also were higher among current cigarette smokers than among those who had never smoked. Taking medications was less common among arthritis patients who had anxiety symptoms (44. 3%; CI = 40. 448. 3) than among those with symptoms of depression (57. 7%; CI = 52. 462. 9) (Figure 2) . Speaking with a mental health professional in the past 12 months was reported by 34. 3% (CI = 30. 338. 1) of arthritis patients with anxiety symp - toms and 42. 8% (CI = 37. 748. 1) of those with symptoms of depression. Discussion This report presents national estimates of clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression among U. S. adults with arthritis. In the United States, an estimated 10. 3 million adults with arthritis reported symptoms of anxiety, depres - sion, or both. Prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depres - sion were substantially higher among adults with arthritis than among those without arthritis, and among adults with FIGURE 1.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1086 MMWR / O ctober 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAmong adults with arthritis and chronic pain, symptoms of anxiety and depression were reported among 31. 2% and 18. 7%, respectively. A potential link exists between chronic pain and anxiety or depression, which might complicate physical and mental health management for persons with arthritis (7) . Having arthritis has been associated with reduced adherence to treatment for depression (8), and in 20002001, nearly one in five surveyed persons with arthritis and major depression reported suicidal ideation within the past year (9) . In clinic-based rheumatic disease studies, both anxiety and depression were associated with reduced response to treatment (10) and poorer quality of life (4) . In addition, the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that only half of persons with a mental health condition receive treatment; the current analysis suggests that treatment prevalence among adults with arthritis might be similar or lower, especially for anxiety. The occurrence of widespread anxiety and depression symp - toms among adults with arthritis points to an unmet need that health care providers can address. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends depression screening for all adults***; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration encourages screening persons of all ages for anxiety and depression; and The Guide to Community Preventive Services recommends collaborative care for depres - sion. The National Pain Strategy encourages addressing chronic pain conditions like arthritis with integrated care and self-management education.  Health care providers can refer their arthritis patients to evidence-based programs like the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, which has benefits including sustained reductions in depression, fatigue, and pain, and increases in aerobic activity, self-efficacy, and self-rated health. ****, Providers can also suggest physical activity, which can improve symptoms of clinical anxiety and depression and can be as effective as medication or therapy for anxiety and depression.  Even those who do not meet the full recommended federal guidelines can still receive physical and psychological benefits from physical activity.   https: //www. nimh. nih. gov/health/statistics/index. shtml. *** https: //www. uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/ RecommendationStatementFinal/depression-in-adults-screening1.  https: //www. integration. samhsa. gov/clinical-practice/screening-tools#bmb.  https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/mental-health-and-mental-illness-collaborative-care-management-depressive-disorders.  https: //iprcc. nih. gov/sites/default/files/HHSNational_Pain_Strategy_508C. pdf. **** https: //www. selfmanagementresource. com/programs/.  https: //www. cdc. gov/arthritis/docs/ASMP-executive-summary. pdf.  https: //health. gov/paguidelines/second-edition/report/pdf/PAG_Advisory_Committee_Report. pdf.  https: //health. gov/paguidelines/guidelines/chapter4. aspx. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, NHIS data are self-reported, and some characteristics might be susceptible to recall and social desirability biases and underreporting because of potential stigma. Second, symptoms of anxiety and depression are not equivalent to clinical diagnoses; the questions ascertain-ing symptoms have no time frame, the intensity question only refers to the most recent episode, and cases cannot be validated. Finally, NHIS data are cross-sectional, so the temporal sequence of arthritis, anxiety, and depression, and other characteristics cannot be determined. FIGURE 2.

S. population aged 18 years using three groups (1844 years, 4564 years, and 65 years) .  Respondents were classified as having arthritis if they responded yes to the question Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia?  Respondents were classified based on a frequency question (anxiety: How often do you feel worried, nervous or anxious? and depression: How often do you feel depressed?) and an intensity question (anxiety: Thinking about the last time you felt worried, nervous or anxious, how would you describe the level of these feelings? and depression: Thinking about the last time you felt depressed, how depressed did you feel?) . Respondents were classified as having symptoms if they responded daily or weekly to the frequency question and a lot or in between a little and a lot to the intensity question. Respondents were classified as not having symptoms if they responded daily or weekly to the frequency question and a little to the intensity question, or if they responded monthly,  a few times a year,  or never to the frequency question. For each symptom, the remaining respondents were excluded from the analysis because their symptom status could not be identified.  Spoke with a mental health pr ofessional in the past 12 months was defined by the question During the past 12 months, have you seen or talked to a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker? ** Taking medications was defined as responding yes to the question Do you take medication for these feelings? (anxiety) or Do you take medication for depression? Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 1087 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? In adults with arthritis, anxiety and depression are associated with poorer overall health and quality of life. What is added by this report? Among adults with arthritis, 22. 5% reported symptoms of anxiety and 12. 1% reported depression. Anxiety and depression symptoms were more common among younger adults, those with chronic pain or comorbid chronic conditions, and those unable to work or who were disabled. What are the implications for public health practice? The high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression among adults with arthritis warrants awareness, screening, and subsequent treatment of these conditions. Health care provid-ers can refer patients to mental health professionals and self-management education programs, and encourage physical activity to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms and improve quality of life. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common among U. S. adults with arthritis. Whereas groups of adults with arthritis who have the highest prevalences of symptoms of anxiety and depression might be high treatment priorities, the high overall prevalence of each indicator compared with those among adults without arthritis suggests that all adults with arthritis would benefit from mental health screening. Health care providers can help their arthritis patients by screening and considering treating or referring adults with symptoms to mental health professionals or self-management education pro - grams, and encouraging physical activity, which is an effective nonpharmacologic strategy that can help reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression, improve arthritis symptoms, and promote better quality of life.

Hennessy, MPH1, 2; Julia A. Schillinger, MD1, 2 Congenital syphilis occurs when syphilis is transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus; congenital syphilis can be prevented through screening and treatment during pregnancy. T ransmission to the fetus can occur at any stage of maternal infection, but is more likely during primary and secondary syphilis, with rates of transmission up to 100% at these stages (1) . Untreated syphilis during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and early infant death. During 20132017, national rates of congenital syphilis increased from 9. 2 to 23. 3 cases per 100, 000 live births (2), coinciding with increasing rates of primary and secondary syphilis among women of reproductive age (3) . In New York City (NYC), cases of primary and secondary syphilis among women aged 1544 years increased 147% during 20152016. To evaluate measures to prevent congenital syphilis, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) reviewed data for congenital syphilis cases reported during 20102016 and identified patient-, provider-, and systems-level factors that contributed to these cases. During this period, 578 syphilis cases among pregnant women aged 1544 years were reported to DOHMH; a congenital syphilis case was averted or other - wise failed to occur in 510 (88. 2%) of these pregnancies, and in 68, a case of congenital syphilis occurred (eight cases per 100, 000 live births) . * Among the 68 pregnant women associ - ated with these congenital syphilis cases, 21 (30. 9%) did not receive timely (45 days before delivery) prenatal care. Among the 47 pregnant women who did access timely prenatal care, four (8. 5%) did not receive an initial syphilis test until <45 days before delivery, and 22 (46. 8%) acquired syphilis after an initial nonreactive syphilis test. These findings support recommenda - tions that health care providers screen all pregnant women for syphilis at the first prenatal care visit and then rescreen women at risk in the early third trimester. * The number of live bir ths come from NYC Vital Statistics data. https: //a816healthpsi. nyc. gov/epiquery/Birth/index. html. The 2009 U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendation Statement and 2015 CDC Sexually T ransmitted Disease T reatment Guidelines recommend sero - logic syphilis screening for all women at first prenatal care visit and additional testing at 2832 weeks gestation and at delivery for women at high risk (4) . Whereas the USPSTF outlines specific groups which might be considered at high risk and recommended for testing during third trimester and at delivery (i. e. , uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex work - ers, illicit drug users, women diagnosed with another sexually transmitted disease, and other women residing in communities with high syphilis morbidity), CDC recommends additional screening for communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and for women at high risk for infection (4) . New York State mandates syphilis screening at the first prenatal care examination  and at delivery (5) and recommends repeat testing throughout pregnancy for women at high risk.  In NYC, the Health Code requires electronic reporting of reactive syphilis tests, as well as an indicator of pregnancy (known or probable) . Women with reactive syphilis serologic tests who are known or suspected to be pregnant are the highest priority for investigation and are monitored throughout pregnancy.  The 2009 USPSTF recommendation statement (G rade A) recommended screening all pregnant women for syphilis at the first prenatal care visit. The recommendation included an additional consideration to test women at high risk for syphilis again during the third trimester and at delivery and specifies groups at increased risk as uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex workers, illicit drug users, women diagnosed with another sexually transmitted disease, and women residing in communities with high syphilis morbidity. https: //www. uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/ClinicalSummaryFinal/syphilis-infection-in-pregnancy-screening. The 2018 USPSTF reaffirmation statement recommends screening all pregnant women when they first present to care and includes a consideration to rescreen women at high risk for syphilis in early third trimester and at delivery. In the 2018 recommendation, women at high risk include those living in communities or geographic areas with higher prevalence of syphilis, those living with HIV, and those with a history of incarceration or commercial sex work. https: //www. uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/Recommendation StatementFinal/syphilis-infection-in-pregnancy-screening1.  New York Public Health Law Section 2308 mandates syphilis screening at the first prenatal care examination. https: //www. nysenate. gov/legislation/laws/ PBH/2308.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 1089 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDOHMH reviewed records of all pregnant women with reported syphilis (any stage) during 20102016, and all con - genital syphilis cases that met surveillance case definitions for confirmed congenital syphilis, probable congenital syphilis, or syphilitic stillbirth. ** The probable congenital syphilis definition includes infants with clinical findings suggesting congenital syphilis (infant criteria), infants born to women who received a diagnosis of syphilis during pregnancy and did not initiate penicillin-based treatment 30 days before delivery (maternal criteria), or both. Data on patients with congenital syphilis and their mothers were abstracted from DOHMHs surveillance and case management registry and reviewed to determine whether prenatal care, syphilis screen - ing, and treatment occurred early enough to prevent congenital syphilis. Both prenatal care and testing were defined as timely if received 45 days before delivery, the assumption being that 15 days is sufficient time for providers and DOHMH to follow up on reactive serology results and ensure treatment initiation 30 days before delivery, thereby preventing a prob-able congenital syphilis case. During 20102016, a total of 578 syphilis infections were reported among women aged 1544 years who were noted to be pregnant: six (1. 0%) primary, 15 (2. 6%) secondary, 126 (21. 8%) early nonprimary nonsecondary, and 431 (74. 6%) unknown duration or late. A total of 510 syphilis infections (88. 2%) were not known to result in a congenital syphilis case. During this period, 68 congenital syphilis cases were reported. A median of eight cases were reported per year, with an increase to 19 cases in 2014 that was not sustained. Half of the 68 women who delivered an infant with congenital syphilis were aged 2029 years, 53 (77. 9%) were non-Hispanic black or Hispanic, and 31 of 56 (55. 4%) with known country of origin were born outside the United States (Table 1) . Among these 68 mothers, 21 (30. 9%) did not receive pre - natal care or a syphilis test 45 days before delivery (Figure) . Although DOHMH does not routinely record the reason why pregnant women with syphilis do not access prenatal care, 16 (76. 2%) of 21 women had documented obstacles to accessing health care, such as substance use, mental health disorders, recent arrival in the United States, or unstable housing. During case investigation, five (23. 8%) women cited lack of health care coverage as a reason for not seeking prenatal care. Four (5. 9%) of the 68 women received timely prenatal care but were not tested for syphilis 45 days before delivery ** During 20102016, cases of congenital syphilis were categorized in accordance with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definitions. https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nndss/conditions/congenital-syphilis.

In alignment with local area-based poverty guidelines, five-year American Community Survey poverty data from 2011 to 2015 were used to divide zip code tabulation areas into four categories indicating the percentage of residents living below the federal poverty limit: low (<10 %), medium (10 to <20%), high (20% to <30%), and very high (30%) . Pregnant women were assigned to a zip code tabulation area based on zip code of residence at the time of reporting.  Calculation of the percent of pregnant women by country of birth excludes women for whom country of birth was unknown.  Calculation of the percentage of pregnant women by syphilis stage excludes two pregnant women who did not meet the maternal criteria for reporting a congenital syphilis case. CDC case definitions were used to assign a syphilis stage to each pregnant woman (https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nndss/conditions/syphilis/case-definition/2018/) .  STIs reported before pregnancy include confirmed cases of syphilis (all stages), chlamydia, and gonorrhea reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene before each pregnant womans estimated last menstrual period. ** STIs reported during pregnancy include confirmed cases of chlamydia reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene between each pregnant womans estimated last menstrual period and delivery date. No pregnant woman in this investigation was reported with gonorrhea during this time.

Box d includes two pregnant women who had stable nontreponemal titers during pregnancy (and therefore did not meet maternal criteria for reporting a congenital syphilis case), but who delivered an infant with signs and symptoms that met the infant criteria for a probable congenital syphilis case. (Figure) . Investigation revealed informatics errors as the reason two of these women were not screened (e. g. , syphilis serologies were not included when programming a prenatal lab order set into a new laboratory ordering system) . These errors occurred in different health systems. One of these womens infant died shortly after birth. Among the 68 women, 22 (32. 4%) had a time-appropriate, nonreactive test and subsequently acquired syphilis during pregnancy (Figure) . Among these women, 15 (68. 2%) did not have a documented syphilis test during the early third trimester (Figure), including 12 (80. 0%) who had at least one characteristic indicating risk for syphilis: 10 lived in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 1091 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhigh-morbidity neighborhood, 11 resided in a high-poverty neighborhood, one received a diagnosis of chlamydia during pregnancy, and two had syphilis before pregnancy. One woman who had a nonreactive test in the second trimester was not screened again until delivery, despite being seen in an emergency department with syphilis symptoms during the third trimester; her infant was stillborn. The remaining 21 (30. 9%) women had a reactive syphilis test 45 days before delivery. Six (28. 6%) of these women had inadequate maternal treatment (Figure) because treatment was initiated too late or not at all. For one woman with inadequate treatment, investigation was delayed because pregnancy status was not known to DOHMH; for another woman, a provider advised delaying treatment, and the woman was not treated until <30 days before delivery. The remaining 15 (71. 4%) initiated treatment 30 days before delivery but had stable or increasing nontreponemal titers consistent with reinfection or persistent infection close to delivery (Figure) . Among the 68 congenital syphilis cases were one syphilitic stillbirth (1. 5%) and another confirmed case (1. 5%) in an infant who later died. The remaining 66 congenital syphilis cases were probable; two (3. 0%) met only infant criteria, 19 (28. 8%) met both infant and maternal criteria, and 45 (68. 2%) met only maternal criteria (Table 2) . Many of the 45 infants who met only maternal criteria lacked documentation of a thorough congenital syphilis examination, 25 (55. 6%) lacked long-bone radiograph results, and 26 (57. 8%) lacked cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count and protein analysis findings. Discussion Approximately 88% of syphilis infections among NYC women noted to be pregnant during 20102016 did not result in congenital syphilis, presumably because of early screening and treatment, underscoring the critical role that provider and public health systems play in preventing congenital syphilis. Nevertheless, 68 congenital syphilis cases were reported during this period, and analysis of these cases provides insight into factors contributing to these preventable infections.  Pregnant women were assigned to one of the 42 United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhoods in NYC and also to a zip code tabulation area based on their zip code at the time of report. UHF neighborhoods are ranked on an annual basis according to the case rate of early latent syphilis among females. Pregnant women were defined as living in a high morbidity neighborhood if they resided in a UHF neighborhood that ranked among the 10 neighborhoods with the highest early latent syphilis case rates among females (top 23. 8% neighborhoods) in the year of their syphilis diagnosis.  Neighborhood poverty categories were assigned in alignment with local areabased poverty guidelines. Pregnant women were defined as living in a high poverty neighborhood if they resided in a zip code tabulation area that was categorized as having high or very high poverty. https: //www1. nyc. gov/assets/ doh/downloads/pdf/epi/epiresearch-SES-measure. pdf. In approximately one third of congenital syphilis cases, the major contributing factor was late initiation of prenatal care; lack of health care coverage was often cited by patients as a bar - rier to seeking care. Citywide in 2015, 83. 2% of new mothers initiated prenatal care during the first trimester,  reflecting the expanded health insurance options available to pregnant women in New York, regardless of immigration status, through Medicaid and the New York health insurance marketplace. *** Absent or late prenatal care among mothers of infants with congenital syphilis suggests that pregnant women with syphi - lis might be unaware of available services or face barriers to obtaining prenatal care; this might be particularly applicable for women born outside the United States.  Data on health insurance coverage and prenatal care come from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, an ongoing population-based survey of new mothers in NYC designed to monitor maternal experiences and behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy. These data are representative of NYC resident women who had a live birth in 2015. *** Information on expanded health insurance options for pregnant women in New York. https: //www1. nyc. gov/site/ochia/find-what-fits/pregnant. page.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1092 MMWR / O ctober 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCDC identified improvement of electronic medical records as an essential area for reversing increases in congenital syphilis. This investigation found two women with timely prenatal care who were not screened for syphilis because of errors in electronic systems, one of whose pregnancy resulted in an infant death. These cases emphasize the importance of data system functionality, such as clinical decision support tools and automated ordering of prenatal laboratory test panels aimed at ensuring syphilis screening in early pregnancy. Testing all pregnant women early in pregnancy and retesting women at high risk at 2832 weeks gestation and at delivery is recommended by CDC (4) and the USPSTF. In this inves - tigation, few mothers of infants with congenital syphilis who acquired syphilis after an initial nonreactive test were screened in the early third trimester, despite that most (80%) could be considered at increased risk for syphilis. This finding points to the need for local guidance and provider training regarding characteristics that indicate a high risk for infection and a need for third-trimester screening. To encourage early detection of syphilis in pregnant women, some states have mandated screening at the first prenatal care examination and during the early third trimester. Universal third-trimester screening effectively prevented most congenital syphilis cases in Florida and Louisiana (6); however, this strategy might not be costeffective in low-morbidity areas (7) . Finally, only two cases met the definition for a confirmed case or syphilitic stillbirth. Among probable cases, most met the surveillance definition solely by maternal criteria and had minimal signs of disease. These cases highlight the challenges inherent in both defining and diagnosing congenital syphilis. The surveillance definition for congenital syphilis intentionally values sensitivity at the expense of specificity, with the goal of maximizing identification of infants potentially infected with syphilis, an important compromise given that the laboratory and radiologic tests required for diagnosis might not be col - lected, and infants might be asymptomatic at birth (8) . The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, data came from DOHMHs surveillance registry, and some are missing or incomplete. Second, NYC has a relatively small number of congenital syphilis cases  and a syphilis epidemic that is largely driven by men who  Ensuring that electronic medical records support syphilis screening is included in CDC Call to Action: Lets Work Together to Stem the Tide of Rising Syphilis in the United States. https: //www. cdc. gov/std/syphilis/ syphiliscalltoactionapril2017. pdf.  The rate of congenital syphilis in NYC in 2016 was 9. 2 per 100, 000 liv e births, which is less than the national congenital syphilis rate in 2016 of 16. 2 per 100, 000 live births. https: //www1. nyc. gov/assets/doh/downloads/ pdf/std/std-quarterlyreport2017-4. pdf. have sex with men (9), and results might not be generalizable to other jurisdictions. Although no sustained increase in congenital syphilis occurred in NYC during 20102016, analysis of 68 cases identified areas where prevention measures might be enhanced. Syphilis screening during pregnancy is critical to preventing congenital syphilis. Health care systems can support screening by ensuring that syphilis tests can be electronically ordered, tracked, received, and flagged for review when results are missing or reactive. In addition, clear guidance regarding third-trimester screening could help identify and treat pregnant women who acquire syphilis during pregnancy.

Summary What is already known about this topic? Cases of congenital syphilis are increasing in the United States and often represent missed opportunities for prevention. What is added by this report? During 20102016, 578 New York City women with syphilis infection were noted to be pregnant, and in 510 (88. 2%) pregnancies congenital syphilis did not occur. In the majority of the 68 congenital syphilis cases, maternal syphilis diagnosis occurred too late to prevent congenital syphilis. What are the implications for public health practice? Provider and public health systems play a critical role in preventing congenital syphilis through screening and treating pregnant women for syphilis; these systems need to be maintained and strengthened.

Occupational risk factors for CTS include engaging in work activities that require forceful, repetitive tasks, prolonged use of the hands or wrists in an awkward posture, or vibration (1) . To assess trends and identify high-risk industries and occupations for CTS, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) analyzed California workers compensation claims for CTS by industry (20072014) and occupation (2014) and cal - culated rates per full-time equivalent (FTE) worker. During 20072014, a total of 139, 336 CTS cases were reported (incidence = 6. 3 cases per 10, 000 FTE) in California work - ers; the rate among women (8. 2) was 3. 3 times higher than that among men (2. 5) . Industries with the highest rates of CTS were textile, fabric finishing, and coating mills (44. 9), apparel accessories and other apparel manufacturing (43. 1), and animal slaughtering and processing (39. 8) . Industries with high rates of CTS should consider implementing intervention measures, including ergonomic evaluations and development of tools and instruments that require less repetition and force and that correct awkward postures. In California, workers compensation insurance companies are required to electronically report to the Department of Industrial Relations all workers compensation claims for occupational injuries or illnesses that cause lost time beyond the day of injury or medical care beyond first aid. During 20072014, an average of 637, 672 workers compensation claims were submitted annually (2) . CDPH previously iden - tified probable and possible CTS cases among these claims during 20072008 but undertook no further analysis of demographics or risk factors (3) . For this analysis, all CTS cases with a date of injury during 20072014 were assigned a 2010 Census Industry Code by trained industry coders. CTS cases in 2014 were assigned a 2010 Census Occupation Code as a pilot of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System computer-assisted auto-coder. * Industryand occupation-specific rates were calculated using data from the * https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/niosh-nioccs/. California sample of the American Community Survey for FTE workers overall and by age group and sex.  An FTE is equal to the total number of hours worked divided by 2, 000 hours, which is equivalent to 50 work weeks at 40 hours per week. This accounts for different patterns of part-time work and overtime in different industries or occupations and is a measure of the risk for injury per hours worked. Changes over time were measured using rate ratios comparing industry rates during 20072010 and 20112014. The CDPH identified 139, 336 probable and possible cases of CTS; the overall rate of CTS among workers was 6. 3 cases per 10, 000 FTE (Table 1) . The rate decreased during the study period from 6. 7 during 20072010 to 5. 9 during 20112014. The rate of CTS was highest among persons aged 4554 years (8. 4); the rate among women (8. 2) was 3. 3 times higher than that among men (2. 5) . Among the 20 industries with the highest rates of CTS (Table 2), three industries had CTS rates approximately six times the average rate: textile, fabric finishing, and coating mills (44. 9); apparel accessories and other apparel manufacturing (43. 1); and animal slaughtering and processing (39. 8) . Among industries with high rates of CTS, the largest numbers of CTS claims were in public administration (8, 713 cases), insurance carriers (4, 836), grocery stores (4, 630), wired and wireless com - munication (3, 412), and employment services (2, 763) . Seven industries had higher rates during 20112014 compared with 20072010; the industries with the highest relative risks during 20112014 compared with 20071010 were commercial and service industry machinery manufacturing (3. 6) and knitting fabric mills (2. 4) . The occupation categories with the highest CTS rates were production (14. 0), material moving (13. 4), and office and administrative support (13. 0) (Table 3) . The Census Occupation Codes with the highest rate of CTS were tele - phone operators (90. 3); cafeteria, food concession, and coffee shop counter attendants (66. 0); and electrical, electronics, and electromechanical assemblers (46. 2) .  https: //www. census. gov/programs-surveys/acs/.

Discussion In this examination of statewide trends in demographic and occupational risk factors for CTS during 20072014 using Californias workers compensation claims, the overall incidence of CTS was 6. 3 per 10, 000 FTE, and the rate was approximately three times higher in women than in men. The rate decreased over time; however, this trend also mir-rors a decrease in all-cause workers compensation claims and could be related to delayed diagnosis and reporting of CTS to workers compensation insurers or insurers misclassification of workers compensation CTS claims. Improved workplace ergonomic designs and employment demographic shifts might have contributed to this trend. Industries with high rates of CTS included those that manufacture apparel, process food, and perform administrative work. The occupation groups with the highest rates included production workers, material mov - ing workers, and office and administrative support workers. Workers in these occupations are often required to perform forceful or repetitive tasks with their hands (e. g. , sewing cloth - ing, butchering meat, or repeatedly lifting heavy items), or maintain an awkward posture on the job (e. g. , driving a motor vehicle, working on a production line, or computer work), all known risk factors for CTS. These findings are consistent with those previously reported using data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, which estimated that the prevalence of CTS was higher among women, and that the highest ratios of CTS cases to percent - age of workforce were among production, office and admin - istrative support, and personal care and service occupations (2. 5%, 1. 66%, and 1. 53%, respectively) (4) . A study using Washington State workers compensation claims reported an annual decrease of 6. 2% CTS incidence during 20022013, similar to the decrease in this analysis (5) . A pooled analysis of six prospective cohorts documented CTS incidence among 50 workgroups of 2. 3 cases per 100 person-years, which is higher than the incidence estimates in this analysis (6) . This could indicate that CTS is underdiagnosed or underreported by TABLE 2.

Costs for CTS medical care are estimated to be $2 billion annually in the United States, primarily from surgical releases; nonmedical costs (e. g. , for mental or psychological health treatment, loss of earnings and productivity, and costs for legal services) are estimated to be much higher (7) . These results suggest that workers compensation claims data can be a useful tool to identify industries and occupa - tions where workers are at risk for developing CTS. Workers compensation data can help describe work-related injuries like CTS that might be underreported in other systems and provide case-level demographic and risk factor data that might not be available from other estimates (8) . Workplace ergonomic interventions that modify tasks, workstations, tools, and equipment can decrease known ergonomic hazards and prevent workplace injuries, including CTS. However, it is not known whether ergonomic interventions were implemented or maintained within the industries with high rates of CTS during the study period. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, inconsistent industry coding and lack of standard occupation coding create difficulties in identifying risk factors within workers compensation systems. As noted, the NIOSH Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System auto-coder, first released for public use in December 2012, facilitated the occupation coding used in this analysis. As auto-coding algorithms improve, more rapid identifica - tion of industries and occupations will be possible. Second, because the California workers compensation claims system does not collect race and ethnicity data, it was not possible Summary What is already known about this topic? Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is an important contributor to work-related disability. What is added by this report? Workers compensation claims of CTS in California during 20072014 overall were 6. 3 per 10, 000 full-time equivalent workers. Female workers and workers in industries that manufacture apparel, process food, and perform administrative work were at highest risk for CTS. The highest rates of CTS were among telephone operators; cafeteria, food concession, and coffee shop counter attendants; and electrical, electronics, and electromechanical assemblers. What are the implications for public health practice? Industries with high rates of CTS should consider implementing intervention measures, including ergonomic evaluations and development of tools and instruments that require less repetition and force and correct awkward postures. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 1097 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionto calculate rates for these important demographic variables. Third, California does not collect the number of employees hours worked by industry, so the American Community Survey was used to calculate FTEs. Using FTEs is a more accurate representation of the risk in these industries than number of workers because it includes time at risk for injury similarly in industries with different percentages of part-time and overtime workers. These three limitations present challenges to analyz-ing a data set designed for administrative rather than public health surveillance use. Finally, only 1 year of data (2014) was occupation coded because of the time and resources necessary to code occupation, even with the assistance of the NIOSH Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System. Whether the occupations at risk for CTS changed over time is not addressed by this analysis. Analysis of workers compensation records is helpful for understanding the industries and occupations that are at a higher risk for CTS and for determining allocation of limited resources for prevention. Industries and occupations identi - fied with high rates of CTS should consider implementing intervention measures, including ergonomic evaluations and development of tools and instruments that require less repeti-tion and force and correct awkward postures. States could use their workers compensation data to identify cases of CTS and use this information to target prevention activities.

In recent years, salmonellosis outbreaks have been caused by foods not typically associated with Salmonella. On May 2, 2017, PulseNet, CDCs national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, identified a cluster of 14 Salmonella Chailey isolates with a rare pulsed-field gel electro - phoresis (PFGE) pattern. On May 29, Canadian health officials informed CDC that they were also investigating a cluster of five Salmonella Chailey infections in British Columbia with the same PFGE pattern. Nineteen cases were identified and investigated by CDC, U. S. state health departments, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. Isolates from all cases were highly related by whole genome sequencing (WGS) . Illness onset dates ranged from March 10 to May 7, 2017. Initial interviews revealed that infected persons consumed various fresh foods and shopped at grocery chain A; focused questionnaires identified precut coconut pieces from grocery chain A as a common vehicle. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a traceback investigation that implicated a single lot of frozen, precut coconut as the outbreak source. Grocery chain A voluntarily removed precut coconut pieces from their stores. This action likely limited the size and scope of this outbreak. Epidemiologic Investigation A case was defined as infection with Salmonella Chailey with the outbreak PFGE pattern with illness onset during March 10May 7, 2017, and highly related by WGS to other cases. Nineteen cases were identified: 14 in seven U. S. states (one case each in Colorado and Kansas, two each in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Washington, and four in Texas) and five cases in British Columbia, Canada (Figure) . Infected per - sons ranged in age from <1 to 87 years (median = 57 years), including two aged <5 years; nine persons were female. Among 17 persons for whom information on hospitalization was known, three were hospitalized; no deaths occurred. Infected persons in the United States were initially inter - viewed using state-developed questionnaires or CDCs National Hypothesis Generating Questionnaire; both col - lected information on foods consumed and locations where food was purchased during the 7 days before illness onset. Review of data collected using these questionnaires revealed that among nine persons with information on grocery stores, seven reported shopping at grocery chain A, which comprises health food stores. Other commonly reported foods consumed included oranges (six persons), strawberries (five), tomatoes (four), kale, tuna, zucchini, almonds (three each), and shrimp (two) . The tuna and other seafood exposures were noteworthy because a strain with the outbreak PFGE pattern had been isolated from yellowfin tuna imported from Indonesia in 2010. Because of the strong fresh-foods signal from the initial information, open-ended interviews were conducted to obtain more information about foods purchased from grocery chain A and other fresh foods that were not included on the stan - dard National Hypothesis Generating Questionnaire (2) used during the initial interviews. Open-ended, iterative interviews were conducted by a single interviewer to gather more detailed information about foods persons ate before they became ill. Interviews were completed for eight persons, including five who had already been interviewed with a standard question-naire. One person reported eating precut coconut pieces from grocery chain A, two persons reported drinking coconut water, two reported eating sushi, seven reported eating oranges, and three reported eating seaweed snacks. Because open-ended interviews did not identify a single food item of interest, a focused questionnaire was developed. The focused question - naire included detailed, open-ended questions about food items purchased from grocery chain A, as well as specific questions asking about consumption of coconut, coconut water, other fruits, vegetables, nuts, seaweed, sushi, and other fish. At the same time, Canadian investigators used a centralized interviewer approach to interview all five infected persons in Canada using a modified version of CDCs focused question - naire. All five persons reported shopping at grocery chain A locations in Canada and consuming precut coconut pieces purchased there. Eleven infected persons in the United States were reinterviewed with the focused questionnaire, and six reported eating precut coconut pieces from grocery chain A. In total, 16 persons in the United States and Canada were reinterviewed, and 11 reported consuming precut coconut pieces from grocery chain A.

Because grocery chain A did not have a shopper card program, consenting persons were asked to share the purchase dates, total purchase dollar amounts, store location, and the first six digits and last four digits of the credit card used at time of purchase. Grocery chain A used this information to retrieve receipts. Seven persons provided information to retrieve receipts from six grocery chain A locations in British Columbia, Oregon, and Texas. Receipts were retrieved for all seven persons, four of whom (one person in the United States, who initially did not report coconut exposure, and three persons in Canada) had precut coconut pieces listed on their receipts (purchase dates March 715, 2017) . Another person who did not provide information to retrieve receipts reported purchasing precut coconut pieces on April 13. A total of 12 persons reported eat - ing precut coconut pieces or had receipts verifying the purchase of precut coconut pieces from grocery chain A. Laboratory Investigation Clinical isolates were characterized by WGS. Whole genome, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (hqSNP) analysis* indicated that the 19 clinical isolates differed by 04 hqSNPs, indicating high genetic relatedness. An additional * Whole genome, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was performed using the Lyve-SET hqSNP pipeline. https: //github. com/lskatz/ lyve-SET. two Salmonella Chailey isolates with the same PFGE pattern from persons in the United States and Canada with illness onset dates consistent with this outbreak were excluded, as they differed from the rest of the isolates by approximately 100 hqSNPs. The isolates from yellowfin tuna imported from Indonesia in 2010 were 19 hqSNPs different from the clinical isolates and were also considered to be not closely related genetically. Inspections and Traceback Canadian officials conducted an inspection at a location of grocery chain A and reported that frozen, vacuum-packed coconut pieces were received at the store every other day. These were thawed at the store and repacked into smaller plastic tubs for sale in the produce area, with a 5-day shelf life applied. Grocery store A headquarters communicated to U. S. officials that all of their stores thaw and repack this product in the store. FDA visited three U. S. -based, FDA-regulated firms associated with the import and repackaging of this product and identified no objectionable conditions. CFIA and FDA conducted a traceback investigation for nine persons in the United States and Canada who all reported consuming precut coconut pieces sold by grocery chain A. These locations received product from three distribution cen - ters located in three states that obtained frozen precut coconut pieces from the same U. S. firm. Records collected by FDA and CFIA at grocery chain A locations, distribution centers, and the processor suggested that a single lot of frozen precut coconut pieces imported from Indonesia was the outbreak source. FDA tested environmental and coconut samples from processing and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1100 MMWR / O ctober 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondistribution centers, but no Salmonella was detected. However, coconut from the suspected lot was not available for testing. Public Health Response Based on the results of the epidemiologic investigation, grocery chain A voluntarily removed thawed, precut coconut pieces from store shelves, which included all precut coconut pieces from the lot identified by the traceback investigation. No public communication was issued, given that this action, combined with the 5-day shelf life of thawed precut coconut pieces, made it unlikely that contaminated precut coconut pieces were still available for purchase or in customers homes. Discussion International collaboration on the epidemiologic and labo - ratory investigation was important for identifying that the Canadian and U. S. cases were part of the same cluster. This allowed investigators to focus on food purchased at grocery chain A and to identify frozen precut coconut pieces as the outbreak source. Early communication and collaboration with grocery chain A assisted the investigation through the collection of detailed purchase history information and facilitated a rapid removal of precut coconut from stores. The timely action of grocery chain A likely limited the size and scope of this outbreak. In recent years, salmonellosis outbreaks have been caused by foods not typically associated with Salmonella. This was the first time that coconut has been associated with an outbreak of Salmonella in the United States or Canada (3) . Cases were reported throughout the United States and Canada that were associated with different grocery chain A locations, supplied by different distribution centers. The single lot of imported, precut coconut pieces was processed over many months but remained frozen and minimally manipulated once in the United States. Therefore, contamination likely occurred in the country of origin, Indonesia. Furthermore, the frozen yellowfin tuna with the same PFGE pattern was imported from Indonesia in 2010, providing support for the hypothesis that a food product from Indonesia could be the source of the outbreak. This was a complicated investigation, and it required consid - erable time and effort by investigators in two countries to iden - tify the food product ultimately responsible for the outbreak. Although no coconut from the suspected lot was available for laboratory sampling, epidemiologic and traceback information indicates that frozen precut coconut pieces were the source of the outbreak. In light of this finding, public health officials might consider raw coconut in investigations of Salmonella outbreaks among consumers of fresh foods.

Foodborne salmonellosis causes an estimated one million U. S. illnesses and 400 deaths annually. What is added by this report? During MarchMay 2017, an outbreak of 19 cases of Salmonella Chailey associated with precut coconut pieces from a single grocery store chain occurred in the United States and Canada. The chain voluntarily recalled precut coconut pieces. This was the first time that coconut has been associated with a Salmonella outbreak in the United States or Canada. What are the implications for public health practice? In recent years, salmonellosis outbreaks have been caused by foods not typically associated with Salmonella. Raw coconut should now be considered in investigations of Salmonella outbreaks among fresh food consumers. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 5, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 39 1101 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNotes from the Field Multiple Cyclosporiasis Outbreaks  United States, 2018 Shannon M. Casillas, MPH1; Carolyne Bennett, MPH1; Anne Straily, DVM1 Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal illness caused by the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis through ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water. Symptoms of cyclosporiasis might include watery diarrhea (most common), loss of appetite, weight loss, cramping, bloating, increased gas, nausea, and fatigue. Typically, increased numbers of cases are reported in the United States during spring and summer; since the mid-1990s, outbreaks have been identified and investigated almost every year. Past outbreaks have been associated with various types of imported fresh produce (e. g. , basil, cilantro, and raspberries) (1) . There are currently no validated molecular typing tools* to facilitate linking cases to each other, to food vehicles, or their sources. Therefore, cyclosporiasis outbreak investigations rely primarily on epidemiologic data. The 2018 outbreak season is noteworthy for multiple outbreaks associated with different fresh produce items and the large number of reported cases. T wo multistate outbreaks resulted in 761 laboratory-confirmed illnesses. The first out - break, identified in June, was associated with prepackaged veg - etable trays (containing broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots) sold at a convenience store chain in the Midwest; 250 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in persons with exposures in three states (illness onset mid-Maymid-June) (2) . The supplier voluntarily recalled the vegetable trays (3) . The second mul-tistate outbreak, identified in July, was associated with salads (containing carrots, romaine, and other leafy greens) sold at a fast food chain in the Midwest; 511 laboratory-confirmed cases during MayJuly occurred in persons with exposures in 11 states who reported consuming salads (4) . The fast food chain voluntarily stopped selling salads at approximately 3, 000 stores in 14 Midwest states that received the implicated salad mix from a common processing facility (5) . The traceback investigation conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not identify a single source or potential point of contamination for either outbreak. In addition to the multistate outbreaks, state public health authorities, CDC, and FDA investigated cyclosporiasis clusters * CDC scientists ar e currently working to develop and validate genetic typing markers for Cyclospora; such markers could facilitate linking cases of cyclosporiasis to each other and to food vehicles and their sources. associated with other types of fresh produce, including basil and cilantro. T wo basil-associated clusters (eight confirmed cases each) were identified among persons in two different states who became ill during June. Investigation of one cluster, for which the state health department conducted an ingredient-specific case-control study, found consumption of basil to be significantly associated with illness. A formal analytic study was not conducted for the other cluster, but all patients reported consuming basil. Three clusters associated with Mexican-style restaurants in the Midwest have resulted in reports of 53 con - firmed cases in persons who became ill during MayAugust. Analytic studies were conducted for two clusters; consumption of cilantro was found to be significantly associated with illness in both. Although a formal analytic study was not possible for the third cluster, all 32 identified patients reported consum - ing cilantro at the restaurant. FDA traceback of the basil and cilantro from these clusters is ongoing. Additional clusters associated with Mexican-style restaurants were identified in multiple states; but investigations to determine a single vehicle of infection were unsuccessful because of small case counts, limited exposure information, or because fresh produce items (including cilantro) were served as components of other dishes (e. g. , in salsa) . Many cases could not be directly linked to an outbreak, in part because of the lack of validated molecular typing tools for C. cayetanensis. As of October 1, 2018, a total of 2, 299 laboratory-confirmed cyclosporiasis cases  have been reported by 33 states in persons who became ill during May 1August 30 and did not have a history of international travel  during the 14 days preceding illness onset. Approximately one third of these cases were associated with either the convenience store chain outbreak or the fast food chain outbreak (Figure) . The median patient age was 49 years (range = <1103 years) and 56% were female (1, 288 of 2, 285) . At least 160 patients were hospitalized; no deaths have been reported. The 2, 299 domestically acquired, laboratory-confirmed cases reported in persons who became ill during MayAugust 2018 are markedly higher than the numbers of cases reported for the same period in 2016 (174) and 2017 (623) . This increase might be due, in part, to changes in diagnostic testing practices, including increased use of gastrointestinal molecular testing  For 2018, the numbers of cases reported by states might change as investigations are finalized.  International travel was defined as travel outside of the United States or Canada.

CDC is working with state public health partners to determine whether and to what extent changes in testing practices might have contributed to increased case detection and reporting. Consumers should continue to enjoy fresh produce as part of a well-balanced diet. To reduce risk from most causes of foodborne illness and other contaminants, CDC recommends washing fresh fruits and vegetables with clean running water; however, washing, including use of routine chemical disinfec - tion or sanitizing methods, is unlikely to kill C. cayetanensis. Persons with diarrheal illness that lasts >3 days or who have any other concerning symptoms should see a health care provider if they think they might have become ill from eating contaminated food.

Casillas, yqj1@cdc. gov, 404-718-1057 Historically, the standard laboratory method used for diagnosing Cyclospora infection was an Ova and Parasite (O&P) examination; routine O&P examination typically does not detect Cyclospora, so health care providers must specifically request testing for the parasite. In 2014, the first FDA-cleared gastrointestinal polymerase chain reaction panel with a target for Cyclospora became commercially available; this testing method is more sensitive than traditional O&P examination and has the potential to improve case detection. 1Parasitic Diseases Branch, Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Center for Global Health, CDC.

Jackson, MD1, 2; Gregory A. Burr2; Carol R. Braun3; Marie A. de Perio, MD2 Lead is toxic to all human organ systems, resulting in adverse health effects that include impaired kidney function, elevated blood pressure, and neurologic health effects (1) . Lead primar - ily enters the body through inhalation and ingestion, but direct absorption through the skin can occur (2) . According to 2014 national lead surveillance data, >94% of the 3, 616 U. S. adults with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) whose exposure source was known were exposed at work (3) . Because of concerns about employees occupational lead exposures, a Missouri bullet manufacturing company that melts lead ingots and casts them into bullets asked CDCs National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to conduct a health hazard evaluation. In October 2017, NIOSH visited the worksite to determine the routes and extent of lead exposure among employees and the prevalence of elevated BLLs and to assess controls in place to protect employees from lead exposure. Full-shift personal air samples and blood specimens for lead were collected from 10 of 11 employees. All 11 employees were interviewed and provided lead hand wipe samples before lunch and at the end of their work shift after washing their hands. Work practices and conditions were also observed. An elevated BLL was defined as 5 g/dL, the CDC adult blood lead reference level (3, 4) . Lead air sample results were compared with occupational exposure limits. Among 10 tested employees, the median BLL was 8. 5 g/dL (range = 435 g/dL) . Of these employees, nine had an elevated BLL, including packaging and shipping employees. The three employees with the highest BLLs worked in the casting and coating areas. All lead air concentrations were below the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit of 50 g/m 3 of air. Lead air concentrations measured in the casting and coating areas were the highest. All employees had lead on their hands after washing them. Interviews revealed inconsistent glove use and handwashing with lead removal soap and lack of clothes or shoes dedicated only to use at the worksite, as well as reports of dry sweeping the floors. Food and beverages were observed in work areas. Skin lesions were observed on the arms of casting area employees, who reported that these lesions were caused by molten lead. Almost all employees at this worksite had elevated BLLs. Although personal airborne lead exposures were below the OSHA permissible exposure limit, lack of a workplace lead control program likely resulted in employee lead exposures through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption. Education and training to improve work practices are needed to reduce employee lead exposures. Such improved work practices would include consistently wearing disposable nonlatex gloves in bullet production areas and handwashing with lead removal soap; using HEPA-filtered vacuums for surface cleaning; elimi - nating food and drink storage and consumption from bullet production areas; and wearing heat-resistant gloves, sleevelets, or both in the casting area to protect skin. The company was also advised to start a comprehensive lead program that incorporates elements of the OSHA lead standard, including training of workers and medical surveillance (5) .

Byrd, PhD1; Carl J. Williams, DVM2; J. Erin Staples, MD, PhD3; Kristen L. Burkhalter3; Harry M. Savage, PhD3; Michael S. Doyle, MS2 La Crosse virus (LACV) is the most common cause of pediatric arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) encephalitis in the United States (1) . It is a California serogroup bunyavi - rus primarily transmitted by the eastern tree-hole mosquito (Aedes triseriatus) (2) . LACV encephalitis is a reportable condition in North Carolina and is a nationally notifiable disease. In North Carolina, LACV encephalitis is the most common endemic arboviral disease reported in humans, with seven west - ern counties accounting for approximately 80% of confirmed cases since 2003 (3) . The fatality rate for LACV encephalitis is <1%, with most patients recovering without overt clinical sequelae; however, long-term neurologic sequelae reported in some patients include recurrent seizures, hemiparesis, and cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities (4) . In August 2017, the North Carolina Department of Public Health (NCDPH) was notified of a suspected LACV encephali - tis case in a boy aged 2 years from western North Carolina. The following day, NCDPH was notified that the patients brother, aged 11 years, was also ill with symptoms consistent with viral meningoencephalitis. Laboratory testing confirmed that both siblings had evidence of recent LACV infection (Table) . An interagency environmental assessment team who visited the siblings residence identified multiple risk factors associ-ated with increased risk for LACV transmission (5) . Water-filled artificial containers containing Aedes mosquito larvae (Ae. triseriatus, Ae. albopictus, and Ae. japonicus) were found on the premises, multiple windows and doors lacked effective screens, and the yard was within close proximity (<50 m) to a mixed hardwood forest. Additional mosquito samples (adult mosquitoes collected by large-bore aspirator and mosquitoes reared from eggs collected by ovitraps) were obtained; mos - quitoes from egg collections were tested for LACV infection by real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (6) and adult mosquitoes were tested by virus isola - tion attempts in cell culture; no virus was detected (7) . The sibling pair was known to play outdoors daily and received mos - quito bites during the expected incubation period (515 days) before disease onset. To identify additional LACV patients among two or more persons residing at the same location, 331 confirmed or prob - able LACV case reports meeting the case definition* were reviewed in the North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System. Three additional coincident patient pairs (two sibling pairs and one caregiver/child pair), linked spatially by place of residence and occurring during the same or sequential epi-demiologic weeks, were identified (Table) . In addition, three instances of confirmed LACV encephalitis were identified in children residing at the same residence, but during different years (spatially linked noncoincident cases) . In one instance, the patients had no familial relationship but were linked by residence (residence F) after a change in home ownership. Three additional cases (one coincident sibling pair and one noncoincident case) were linked by residence within the same multibuilding apartment cluster (residence C) . These identified cases indicate that LACV disease risk can occur coincidently or noncoincidentally in time in persons at the same physical residence and further support surveillance data indicating that the disease is highly focal, occurring in a limited geographic area (8) . This finding suggests that environ - mental assessments and modifications (e. g. , filling tree holes, installing and repairing window or door screens, and removing water-filled containers) at locations where cases occur could help reduce the risk for this disease. In addition, persons living at the residence of a patient with a newly identified case of LACV disease or in an area where the virus is known to occur should be advised of the risk and measures to reduce risk, such as using Environmental Protection Agencyregistered and recommended insect repellents, reducing time outdoors when mosquitoes are active, appropriate environmental modi - fications, and wearing clothing that prevents mosquito bites. Finally, health care providers should be aware of the potential clustering of LACV disease at a specific location and routinely advise their patients about mosquito prevention measures they can take to lower their risk.

Participants were classified as having undiagnosed diabetes if they did not report a diagnosis of diabetes by a health care provider, and their fasting (824 hours) plasma glucose was 126 mg/dL or their hemoglobin A1C was 6. 5%. Total diabetes was the combined prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes.  Current criteria from the American Diabetes Association were applied to define diabetes for all current and previous years of data. Backward calibration equations were used to adjust for changes in laboratory techniques and procedures over time. All estimates for adults are age-adjusted by the direct method to the projected 2000 U. S. Census population using age groups 2039, 4059, and 60 years. From 19992000 to 20152016, the prevalence of total diabetes increased from 9. 0% to 12. 9%. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased from 6. 2% to 10. 0%. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 2. 8% in 19992000 and 2. 9% in 20152016 with no significant change over this period.
