Croft, PhD1; Anne G. Wheaton, PhD1; Yong Liu, MD1; Fang Xu, PhD1; Hua Lu, MS1; Kevin A. Matthews, MS1; Timothy J. Cunningham, ScD1; Yan Wang, PhD1; James B. Holt, PhD1 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) accounts for the majority of deaths from chronic lower respiratory dis - eases, the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2015 and the fourth leading cause in 2016. * Major risk factors include tobacco exposure, occupational and environmental exposures, respiratory infections, and genetics.  State variations in COPD outcomes (1) suggest that it might be more common in states with large rural areas. To assess urban-rural variations in COPD prevalence, hospitalizations, and mortal - ity; obtain county-level estimates; and update state-level varia - tions in COPD measures, CDC analyzed 2015 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare hospital records, and death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) . Overall, 15. 5 million adults aged 18 years (5. 9% age-adjusted prevalence) reported ever receiving a diagnosis of COPD; there were approximately 335, 000 Medicare hospitalizations (11. 5 per 1, 000 Medicare enrollees aged 65 years) and 150, 350 deaths in which COPD was listed as the underlying cause for persons of all ages (40. 3 per 100, 000 population) . COPD prevalence, Medicare hospi - talizations, and deaths were significantly higher among persons living in rural areas than among those living in micropolitan or metropolitan areas. Among seven states in the highest quartile for all three measures, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and West Virginia were also in the upper quartile (18%) for rural residents. Overcoming barriers to prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, and management of COPD with primary care provider education, Internet access, physical activity and self-management programs, and improved access to pulmonary * Leading causes of death reported for 2015 at https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/ nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_05. pdf and for 2016 at https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/ products/databriefs/db293. htm.  https: //www. cdc. gov/copd. rehabilitation and oxygen therapy are needed to improve quality of life and reduce COPD mortality. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties, which uses 2010 U. S. Census population data and the February 2013 Office of Management and Budget designations of metropoli-tan statistical area, micropolitan statistical area, or noncore area (2), was used to classify urban-rural status of BRFSS respon - dents, Medicare inpatient claims, decedents, and populations at risk based on reported county of residence. The six categories include large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, small metropolitan, micropolitan, and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report206 MMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe MMWR series of publications is published by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.

Prevalence of diagnosed COPD was estimated using the 2015 BRFSS survey, an annual state-based, random-digitdialed cellular and landline telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U. S. population aged 18 years  that is conducted by state health departments in collaboration with CDC. In 2015, the median survey response rate for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) was 46. 6% and ranged from 33. 9% to 61. 1%.  Diagnosed COPD was defined as an affirmative response to the question Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis? State analyses included 426, 838 (98. 3%) respondents in the 50 states and DC after exclusions for missing information on COPD or age (Table 1) . Urban-rural analyses included 426, 736 (98. 2%) respondents after excluding those who had missing informa - tion for COPD, age, or county code.  https: //www. cdc. gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2015. html.  Response rates for BRFSS are calculated using standards set by American Association for Public Opinion Research response rate formula 4. The response rate is the number of respondents who completed the survey as a proportion of all eligible and likely eligible persons. http: //www. aapor. org/AAPOR_Main/ media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal. pdf. Response rates in 2015 for individual states are available at https: //www. cdc. gov/brfss/ annual_data/2015/pdf/2015-sdqr. pdf. A multilevel regression and poststratification approach (4) was used to estimate model-predicted COPD prevalence for U. S. counties in 2015. High internal validity was determined by comparing modeled estimates with actual unweighted BRFSS survey estimates in 1, 507 counties with 50 respon - dents (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0. 68; p<0. 001), and with weighted BRFSS survey estimates in 195 counties with 500 respondents and relative standard errors <0. 30 (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0. 74; p<0. 001) . Medicare enrollment records and data from 100% of Part A (inpatient hospital) claims in 2015 were obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Analyses were limited to 30, 212, 024 living Medicare Part A enrollees aged 65 years who were eligible for fee-for-service hospitalizations on July 1, 2015, and all 335, 362 fee-for-service inpatient hospital claims with a first-listed diagnosis of COPD that were submitted in 2015 for Medicare Part A enrollees aged 65 years. COPD was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 490492 or 496 or ICD-10-CM codes J40J44. ** Urban-rural analyses were lim - ited to 335, 102 (99. 9%) hospital claims. ** International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for COPD include 490 (bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic), 491 (chronic bronchitis), 492 (emphysema), or 496 (chronic airway obstruction); ICD-10-CM codes include J40 (bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic), J41 (simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis), J42 (unspecified chronic bronchitis), J43 (emphysema), or J44 (other COPD) . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 207 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionMortality data for all ages were analyzed using CDC WONDER, an interactive public-use Web-based tool. CDC WONDER mortality data from NVSS contain information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and DC. CDC WONDER queries generated numbers of deaths, age-adjusted death rates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and population denominators for groups defined by state and the 2013 NCHS urban-rural classification of decedents. Deaths caused by COPD were defined by ICD-10 codes J40J44, in which COPD was the underlying cause of death on the death certificate. CDC also obtained population estimates for 2015 from CDC WONDER to calculate the percentage of U. S. and state residents who lived in a rural county as classified by the NCHS 2013 urban-rural county classification. Age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed COPD for persons aged 18 years, Medicare hospitalization rate for persons aged  https: //wonder. cdc. gov. Population estimates for groups defined by urban-rural status and state are bridged-race estimates of the July 1, 2015, resident population from the Vintage 2015 postcensal series that were released on June 28, 2016. 65 years, death rate for all ages, and 95% CI for each estimate were calculated by urban-rural classification and state. For BRFSS analyses, statistical software was used to account for the complex sampling design. Differences in COPD preva - lence among rural respondents compared with those of other urban-rural subgroups were determined by t-tests. Urban-rural differences in Medicare hospitalizations and death rates were determined by the Z-test. All two-sided tests were considered statistically significant at a = 0. 05. In 2015, approximately 15. 5 million adults aged 18 years (unadjusted prevalence = 6. 3% and age-adjusted preva - lence = 5. 9%) had self-reported diagnosed COPD. County-level estimates of COPD prevalence ranged from 3. 2% to 15. 6% (Figure) . U. S. counties within the highest quartile of county-level estimates (8. 5%-15. 6%) tended to be located in nonmetropolitan areas of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West Virginia (Figure) . Age-adjusted prevalence of diagnosed COPD among adults aged 18 years increased with less urbanicity from 4. 7% among TABLE 1.

Medicare hospitalizations (per 1, 000 enrollees) for COPD were 11. 4 among enrollees aged 65 years living in large metropolitan centers and 13. 8 among those living in rural areas. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100, 000 population) for COPD as the underlying cause also increased with less urbanicity from 32. 0 for U. S. residents liv - ing in large metropolitan centers to 54. 5 for those living in rural areas. There was a consistent pattern for significantly higher estimates of COPD measures from all three independent data systems among adults living in rural areas than among those living in micropolitan or metropolitan areas. Overall 5. 9% of U. S. residents lived in rural counties in 2015. State-specific percentages of rural residents ranged from zero percent in Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, New Jersey, and Rhode Island to 34. 7% in Montana (Table 2) . State-specific age-adjusted prevalence of COPD among adults aged 18 years in 2015 ranged from 3. 8% in Utah to 12. 0% in West Virginia. State-specific age-adjusted Medicare hospitaliza - tion rates (per 1, 000 enrollees) among enrollees aged 65 years ranged from 3. 7 in Utah to 19. 7 in West Virginia. State-specific age-adjusted death rates (per 100, 000 population) in 2015 ranged from 15. 8 in Hawaii to 64. 3 in Oklahoma. Of the seven states (Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and West Virginia) that were in the highest quartiles for all three measures in 2015, four states (Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, and West Virginia) were also in the highest quartile (18%) for percentage of rural residents. Discussion In 2015, rural U. S. residents experienced higher age-adjusted COPD prevalence, Medicare hospitalizations for COPD as the first-listed diagnosis, and deaths caused by COPD than did residents in micropolitan or metropolitan areas.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 210 MMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionaddition to the major risk factors for COPD, which include tobacco smoke, environmental and occupational exposures, respiratory infections, and genetics, correlates include older ages, low socioeconomic status, and asthma history (5, 6) . Rural populations might have higher COPD risk because these populations have a greater proportion with a history of smoking (3), more secondhand smoke exposure but less access to smoking cessation programs,  and higher proportions of uninsured or lower socioeconomic residents, which might have limited access to early diagnosis, treatment, and management of COPD.  Rural respiratory exposures might include mold spores, organic toxic dust, and nitrogen dioxide, which are associated with COPD risk (7) . COPD management includes efforts to slow declining lung function, improve exercise tolerance, and prevent and treat exacerbations. T reatments include pulmonary rehabili-tation, oxygen therapy, and medications. Smoking cessation programs, routine influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, regular physical activity, and reductions in occupational and environmental exposures are also important. Barriers to health care in rural areas include cultural perceptions about seeking care, travel distance, absence of services, and financial burden (8) . Access to early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and manage - ment of COPD by a pulmonologist is difficult for rural adults with COPD because of limited geographic accessibility to this COPD specialty (9) . Therefore, much of the COPD in rural areas is diagnosed and managed by primary care provid - ers (9) . Level of care and patient-physician communication might vary, given that 27% of adults with COPD symptoms in 2016 reported that they had not talked with their physi - cian about these symptoms (10) . In a primary care physician survey, 71% said that they would use spirometry to assess patients with COPD symptoms, but they also reported that important barriers to diagnosing COPD included patient failure to report COPD symptoms or smoking history, poor treatment adherence, more immediate competing health issues, and diagnostic procedure costs (10) . Whereas 68% of primary care physicians were aware that pulmonary rehabilitation programs were available to their patients, only 38% routinely prescribed this therapy for COPD patients (10) . However, rural areas might have limited availability to these programs. Provision of online health care services (i. e. , telemedicine) in rural areas could reduce some of these barriers by providing health education and support websites to patients and caregiv - ers, appointment assistance, and ability to check assessment results online; however, lack of Internet access is still a barrier in some rural populations (8) .  http: //www. lung. org/assets/documents/research/cutting-tobaccos-rural-roots. pdf.  http: //www. countyhealthrankings. org/reports/key-findings-2016. The findings in this report are subject to at least eight limita - tions. First, self-reported diagnosed COPD in BRFSS cannot be validated with medical records and might be subject to recall and social desirability biases; however, urban-rural variations in prevalence were similar to Medicare claims. Second, the BRFSS study population does not include adults who live in long-term care facilities, prisons, and other facilities; thus, findings are not generalizable to those populations. Third, state BRFSS response rates were relatively low, and response rates cannot be obtained by urban-rural classification. This might have resulted in overestimates or underestimates of COPD prevalence; however, a strength is that BRFSS provides large, stable sample sizes for all six urban-rural classifications. Fourth, the assumption that the six urban-rural classifications reflect consistent types of distinct populations and social environ - ments within and across each state could potentially be incor - rect. Fifth, county-level estimates are modeled and based on population characteristics such as distributions of older adults in the county; furthermore, it is not known how previous or current local interventions (e. g. , tobacco cessation policies and programs) might have affected current COPD prevalence. Sixth, Medicare claims should not be interpreted as unique prevalent cases because some might reflect readmissions; however, these COPD estimates do reflect the actual Medicare burden for hospital facilities, pulmonary rehabilitation services, health care providers, caregivers, and other resources. Seventh, both Medicare hospital claims and death certificates might be subject to reporting preferences for certain diseases as the first-listed or underlying cause if there is a consistent regional or urban-rural preference. Finally, although the data reported here show higher COPD hospitalization and death rates for rural populations, they do not assess whether hospitalization and death rates among patients with COPD vary by urbanicity. Higher burdens of COPD among rural U. S. residents highlight needs for continued tobacco cessation programs and policies to prevent COPD and improve pulmonary function among smokers. Known barriers to care in rural areas suggest a need for improved access for adults with COPD to treatment strategies (pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy) and comprehensive chronic disease self-management programs. Health care providers and community partners who serve rural residents can help adults with COPD increase access to and participation in health care interventions. Federal agencies are promoting collaborative and coordinated efforts to educate the public, providers, patients, and caregivers about COPD and improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COPD.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 211 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and has been diagnosed in 15. 5 million adults in 2015 in the United States. Risk factors include tobacco expo - sure, occupational and environmental exposures, respiratory infections, and genetics. What is added by this report? In 2015, rural U. S. residents had higher age-adjusted prevalence of COPD, of Medicare hospitalizations, and deaths caused by COPD than did residents living in micropolitan or metropolitan areas. Several states with the highest percentages of rural populations also had the highest estimates for all three measures. What are the implications for public health practice? Additional efforts are needed to prevent risk factors and overcome barriers to early diagnosis, and the appropriate treatment and management of COPD. Improving access to such health care might improve quality of life and reduce hospital readmissions among COPD patients and reduce COPD mortality. access to online communities, develop clinical decision tools for primary health care providers, and conduct research to improve access to care for COPD in hard-to-reach areas. Promoting these efforts has the potential to improve quality of life for COPD patients and reduce hospital readmissions and COPD mortality.

Cheryl Baez Ocfemia, MPH1; Richard Dunville, MPH2; Tianchi Zhang, MS1; Lisa C. Barrios, DrPH2; Alexandra M. Oster, MD1 In 2014, persons aged 1329 years represented 23% of the U. S. population, yet accounted for 40% of diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during the same year (1) . During 20102014, the rates of diagnosis of HIV infection decreased among persons aged 1519 years, were stable among persons aged 2024 years, and increased among persons aged 2529 years (1) . However, these 5-year age groups encompass multiple developmental stages and potentially mask trends associated with the rapid psychosocial changes during adolescence through young adulthood. To better understand HIV infection among adolescents aged 1317 years and young adults aged 1829 years in the United States and identify ideal ages to target primary HIV prevention efforts, CDC analyzed data from the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) * using narrow age groups. During 20102014, rates of diagnosis of HIV infection per 100, 000 population varied substantially among persons aged 1315 years (0. 7), 1617 years (4. 5), 1819 years (16. 5), and 2021 years (28. 6), and were higher, but less variable, among persons aged 2223 years (34. 0), 2425 years (33. 8), 2627 years (31. 3), and 2829 years (28. 7) . In light of the remarkable increase in rates between ages 1617, 1819, and 2021 years, and a recent study revealing that infection precedes diagnosis for young persons by an average of 2. 7 years (2), these findings demonstrate the importance of targeting primary prevention efforts to persons * CDCs National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) is the primary source for monitoring HIV trends in the United States. Through NHSS, CDC collects, analyzes, and disseminates surveillance data on HIV infection. aged <18 years and continuing through the period of elevated risk in their mid-twenties. CDC analyzed data on persons aged 1329 years who had HIV infection diagnosed during 20102014 and reported to NHSS through June 2016. Numbers and rates of diagnosed infections were calculated by year of diagnosis and by 2-year and 3-year age groups (ages 1315, 1617, 1819, 2021, 2223, 2425, 2627, and 2829 years) and selected char - acteristics. A single 3-year age group was required because of the odd number of years. All rates (per 100, 000 population) were calculated using data from the U. S. Census Bureau for the denominators. Multiple imputation was used to assign a transmission category to persons reported without an identi - fied risk factor (3) . To assess trends during 20102014, the estimated annual percent change in HIV diagnosis rates was calculated using Poisson regression; changes were considered to be statistically significant if the 95% confidence interval (CI) excluded 0. During 20102014, in 50 states and the District of Columbia, 78, 337 persons aged 1329 years had diagnosed HIV infection (Table 1) . The overall HIV diagnosis rate was 21. 3 per 100, 000 population. By age group, HIV diagnosis rates varied substantially among persons aged 1315 years (0. 7), 1617 years (4. 5), 1819 years (16. 5), and 2021 years (28. 6) . HIV diagnosis rates were higher, but less variable, among persons aged 2223 years (34. 0), 2425 years (33. 8), 2627 years (31. 3), and 2829 years (28. 7), with the highest rate in those aged 2223 years (Table 1) .

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 214 MMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhad infections attributable to male-to-male sexual contact, and among these, males aged 2223 years accounted for the high-est number of diagnoses (12, 275 [20. 6%]) . Among 11, 866 females with diagnosed HIV infection, 10, 462 (88. 2%) had infections attributable to heterosexual contact, and among these, females aged 2627 and 2829 years accounted for the highest numbers of diagnoses (1, 891 [18. 1%] and 1, 904 [18. 2%], respectively) . By region, the South accounted for the highest number and rate of HIV diagnoses among persons aged 1329 years (40, 667 [51. 9%]; 148. 2 per 100, 000 population) . During 20102014, the overall HIV diagnosis rate among persons aged 1329 years remained stable (estimated annual percent change = 0. 4, 95% CI = -0. 1 to 0. 9) (Table 1) . However, by age group, rates per 100, 000 population increased during 20102014 among persons aged 2425 years (from 32. 4 to 35. 4) and 2627 years (from 30. 2 to 33. 9) and decreased among persons aged 1617 years (from 5. 0 to 4. 2), 1819 years (from 17. 7 to 15. 6), and 2021 years (from 30. 1 to 28. 3) (Table 1) (Figure) . Rates remained stable among persons aged 1315, 2223, and 2829 years. Discussion This analysis revealed large differences in rates of diagnosis of HIV infection with increasing age among persons aged 1315, 1617, 1819, and 2021 years. This report also documents trends in diagnoses during 20102014 by narrow age groups, with increasing rates observed among persons aged 2425 and 2627 years and decreasing rates among persons aged 1617, 1819, and 2021 years. Studies focused on adolescents and young adults with HIV infection commonly incorporate broader age ranges (e. g. , 1329 years), obscuring important distinctions that can con-tribute to a better understanding of HIV infections among persons during adolescence and into young adulthood (4) . Adolescence and young adulthood are periods of considerable biologic and physiologic change and represent developmental phases when engagement in high-risk sexual behaviors and alcohol and other drug use peak and the risk for acquiring HIV infection increases (4, 5) . However, few HIV-related studies have taken into account these developmental transitions, and studies rarely include persons aged <18 years (5) . A recent longitudinal study in an urban area with high HIV prevalence among men aged 1620 years who have sex with men found that HIV incidence was just as high among participants aged <18 years as among older participants (5), highlighting the importance of including adolescents aged <18 years in research and prevention efforts, particularly HIV testing. A previous study has also shown delays in diagnosis of HIV infection of an average of 2. 7 years in persons aged 1324 years (2), FIGURE.

Data include persons with a diagnosis of HIV infection regardless of stage of disease at diagnosis. indicating that the period of risk for HIV acquisition begins before age 18 years. To help address the impact of HIV infection among ado - lescents and young adults, especially sexual and racial/ethnic minority populations, two national goals focus on persons aged 1324 years as a priority population at risk to monitor the percentage of young gay and bisexual men who have engaged in HIV acquisition risk behaviors and the percentage of adoles - cents and young adults with diagnosed HIV infection who are virally suppressed (<200 HIV RNA copies/mL) through use of antiretroviral therapy (6) . Unfortunately, adolescents and young adults are least likely to be linked to and retained in HIV care or to achieve viral suppression (7, 8) . In 2014, among men who have sex with men, who account for the majority of persons with HIV infection among persons aged 1324 years, 48% were aware of their infection; awareness of infection is crucial to health and prevention (9) . Among persons aged 1324 years with infection diagnosed in 2014, 68% were linked to HIV medical care within 1 month of diagnosis, and among those living with diagnosed HIV infection at the end of 2013, 55% were retained in care, and 44% were virally suppressed (8) . All of these indicators are well below national targets (9) . Additional studies are needed to identify barriers that affect testing, retention in care, and access to health services, including the use of preexposure prophylaxis, among adolescents and young adults, particularly persons aged <18 years (6, 7) . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 215 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? In 2014, persons aged 1329 years represented 23% of the U. S. population, yet accounted for 40% of diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States during the same year. What is added by this report? HIV diagnoses analyzed by age groups revealed striking differences in rates of diagnosis of HIV infection between ages 1321 years. During 20102014, HIV infection diagnosis rates per 100, 000 population varied substantially with increasing age among persons aged 1315 years (0. 7), 1617 years (4. 5), 1819 years (16. 5), and 2021 years (28. 6) . HIV diagnosis rates were higher, but less variable, among persons aged 2223 years (34. 0), 2425 years (33. 8), 2627 years (31. 3), and 2829 years (28. 7) . What are the implications for public health practice? The findings underscore the importance of using a multifaceted approach and targeting primary prevention efforts to persons aged <18 years and continuing through the period of elevated risk in their mid-twenties. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the data presented reflect diagnoses of HIV infection, which are subject to diagnosis delay when compared with incidence, and are not necessarily representative of all persons with HIV infection. Whereas there are models avail - able to estimate incidence, such approaches typically yield wide confidence intervals and unreliable estimates for narrow age groups. Second, trends in diagnoses of HIV infection might be attributed to changes in testing, transmission, or reporting. Finally, state laws affecting minors consent to care and dispari - ties in access might also affect testing behaviors. These findings underscore the importance of targeting primary prevention efforts to persons aged <18 years, spe - cifically those aged 1617 years, and continuing through the period of elevated risk in the mid-twenties. Much remains to be understood about the factors that affect adolescents and young adults at high risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. CDC supports school districts and state education agencies that promote environments where teens can gain fundamental health knowledge and skills, establish healthy behaviors for a lifetime, connect to health services, and avoid becoming pregnant or infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases (10) . When implementing effective HIV prevention strategies, a multifaceted approach that incorporates the educational, social, policy, and health care systems can help support youths as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood (7) .

Familial ALS, a hereditary form of the disease, accounts for 5%10% of cases, whereas the remain-ing sporadic cases have no clearly defined etiology (1) . ALS affects persons of all races and ethnicities; however, whites, males, non-Hispanics, persons aged >60 years, and those with a family history of ALS are more likely to develop the disease (13) . No cure for ALS has yet been identified, and the lack of proven and effective therapeutic interventions is an ongoing challenge. Current treatments available do not cure ALS but have been shown to slow disease progression. Until recently, only one drug (riluzole) was approved to treat ALS; however, in 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved a second drug, edaravone (4) . This report presents National ALS Registry (Registry) findings regarding ALS prevalence for the period January 1December 31, 2014, and, for the first time, includes Medicare hospice data and ALS prevalence rates by Census region. ALS prevalence did not change from 2013, remaining at 5. 0 cases per 100, 000 persons in 2014. Data collected by the Registry are being used to better describe the epidemiology of ALS in the United States and to facilitate research. In 2008, the U. S. Congress passed the ALS Registry Act, which authorized the creation and maintenance of the Registry by CDC; CDC delegated this responsibility to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (5) . The main goals of the Registry are to better describe the incidence and prevalence of ALS, characterize the demographics of persons living with ALS in the United States, and examine potential risk factors such as environmental and occupational influ - ences. Because ALS is not a notifiable disease in the United States, the Registry employs a novel case-finding approach that uses administrative and self-reported data to identify cases, whereas usual noncommunicable disease registries (e. g. , cancer) typically rely on data reported from health care providers to identify cases. ATSDRs Registry uses a two-pronged approach to identify ALS cases (6) . The first component applies a pilot-tested algorithm that includes elements such as the International Classification of Diseases code for ALS, frequency of visits to a neurologist, and prescription drug use to three large national databases (Medicare, Veterans Health Administration, and Veterans Benefits Administration) . The algorithm categorizes cases as definite ALS, possible ALS, and not ALS; only definite ALS cases are entered into the Registry. Possible ALS cases are evaluated for conversion to definite ALS in subse - quent years. The second component comprises a secure web portal to allow persons with ALS to self-register to facilitate identification of cases not collected through the first compo - nent (7) . Cases from both data sources are then merged and deduplicated. In addition, for this report, Medicare hospice data were included for the first time. Once an ALS case is identified, it remains a case until the person is confirmed as deceased by obtaining death data from the National Death Index. The prevalence of ALS was calculated from the Registry by using the deduplicated total number of persons with ALS identified through administrative data and those who self-identified through the portal as the numerator. The 2014 Census estimate was used for the denominator (8) . A total of 15, 927 persons were identified as having definite ALS across the three national databases and through web portal registration for 2014 (Table) . The estimated prevalence for 2014 was 5. 0 per 100, 000 population, representing no increase from 2013 (5. 0 per 100, 000) . No significant increases were observed across age groups (Figure) . The lowest prevalence (0. 5 per 100, 000 population) was among persons aged 1839 years, and the highest (20. 0) was among persons aged 7079 years. As in 2013, the prevalence in males (6. 3) was higher than that in females (3. 6) (Table) . The ratio of cases in males to those in females was 1. 7: 1. The prevalence in whites (5. 4) was more than twice that in blacks (2. 4) . Prevalence rates were also calculated for the four U. S. Census regions: Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. Rates were highest in the Midwest (5. 7 per 100, 000 population), fol - lowed by the Northeast (5. 5), the South (4. 7), and the West (4. 3) (Table) . Discussion Data sources for the Registry remain unchanged, but the national administrative data now include hospice data from Medicare. The Registrys novel approach of using national administrative databases is the cornerstone for identifying ALS cases because most of the definite ALS cases from 2010 to 2014 originate from this source. Since publication of the first surveillance summary that reported analyzed data for 20102011 (2) and for subsequent Prevalence of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  United States, 2014 Paul Mehta, MD1; Wendy Kaye, PhD1; Jaime Raymond, MPH1; Ruoming Wu, MPH1; Theodore Larson, MS1; Reshma Punjani, MPH1; Daniel Heller1; Jessica Cohen, MPH1; T racy Peters, PhD1; Oleg Muravov, MD, PhD1; Kevin Horton, DrPH1Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 217 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionPrevalence rates by U. S. Census regions are consistent with ALS demographics. Overall, whites have a higher prevalence of ALS than blacks. The higher ALS prevalence in the Midwest and Northeast likely reflects the higher proportion of whites, compared with the South and West (8) . The lowest prevalence in the West Census region is most likely related to the popula - tion diversity in states such as California (8) . The Registry continues to expand ALS research nationally. In January 2017, the National ALS Biorepository (Biorepository), a component of the Registry, was launched. The Biorepository is novel in several ways. First, it obtains samples from Registry enrollees via in-home collection (e. g. , blood, hair, or saliva) and postmortem collection (e. g. , brain, bone, spinal cord, cere - brospinal fluid, muscle, and skin) at no charge to patients or their caregivers. Currently, the few existing ALS biorepositories largely have samples from specific clinics or medical practices, and the samples that are left over from previous clinical trials in the United States. Second, specimens from the National ALS Biorepository are collected from a geographically repre - sentative sample of Registry enrollees. The sample of persons recruited to participate in the Biorepository correlates with the population distribution of the United States and each year will include at least one person from each state. Third, these deidentified samples are paired with completed risk factor survey data (e. g. , occupational and military history) from the Registry. Researchers are currently able to request samples alone or paired with risk factor data. The availabil - ity of additional specimens from a national sample of ALS patients further expands research potential on the genetics, potential biomarkers, environmental pollutants, and etiology for ALS.

These patterns remain unchanged for 2014. It was hypothesized that the prevalence would increase in 2014 with the additional hospice data; how - ever, this was not the case. Additional years of data are needed to determine whether ALS cases are increasing, decreasing, or remaining the same in the United States. The inclusion of Medicare hospice data for the first time in 2014 did not affect estimated ALS prevalence. Many patients identified through hospice data had been previously identified in either Medicare data, Veterans Health Administration data, Veterans Benefits Administration data, or the web portal. The Registry contin-ues to evaluate additional data sources for case identification as well as ways to increase self-registration through the secure web portal to increase case ascertainment. FIGURE.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 218 MMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, ALS is not a notifiable disease, and ensuring that all newly diagnosed and prevalent ALS cases in the United States are collected in the Registry is challenging; therefore, the pos - sibility of underascertainment exists. Second, although every attempt was made to deduplicate the files, differences in fields collected by the different sources, misspellings of names, and data entry errors could have prevented records from merging correctly. However, it is unlikely that this occurred in numbers sufficient to affect the overall conclusions. Third, the calcula - tion of ALS incidence with Registry data is not possible at this time because the date of diagnosis is not collected through the large administrative database approach, and cases without a date of diagnosis account for more than two thirds (68%) of cases in the Registry. Finally, the Registry has been officially active since October 2009 and is still being enhanced. As more persons with ALS enroll and complete surveys, a better understanding of possible risk factors might emerge (2, 3) . Establishment of the National ALS Registry, as well as the newly launched National ALS Biorepository, fills a critical scientific gap by providing estimates of prevalence of this dis-ease and facilitates further study of risk factors and etiology. The National ALS Registry continues to be improved and enhanced, increasing its potential for ALS research and detec - tion of more ALS cases. ATSDR is committed to advancing ALS research and monitoring trends of ALS prevalence in the United States. 1Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, CDC. Corresponding author: Paul Mehta, pum4@cdc. gov, 770-488-0556. Summary What is already known about this topic? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease, is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease. Familial ALS, a hereditary form of the disease, accounts for 5%10% of cases; the remaining sporadic cases have no clearly defined etiology. What is added by this report? A total of 15, 927 persons were identified as having definite ALS across three national databases (Medicare, Veterans Health Administration, and Veterans Benefits Administration) and through web portal registration for 2014. The estimated ALS prevalence for 2014 was 5. 0 cases per 100, 000 population, the same as 2013 estimate. What are the implications for public health practice? Through ongoing enhancements and expanded outreach and promotion, the National ALS Registry has the potential to expand ALS research and detect more ALS cases in the United States. References 1.

The prevalence of hypertension is highest among non-Hispanic blacks, whereas the prevalence of antihypertensive medication use is lowest among Hispanics (1) . Geographic variations have also been identified: a recent report indicated that the Southern region of the United States had the highest prevalence of hypertension as well as the highest prevalence of medication use (3) . Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), this study found minimal change in state-level prevalence of hypertension awareness and treatment among U. S. adults dur - ing the first half of the current decade. From 2011 to 2015, the age-standardized prevalence of self-reported hypertension decreased slightly, from 30. 1% to 29. 8% (p = 0. 031); among those with hypertension, the age-standardized prevalence of medication use also decreased slightly, from 63. 0% to 61. 8% (p<0. 001) . Persistent differences were observed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, and state of residence. Increasing hypertension awareness, as well as increasing hypertension control through lifestyle changes and consistent antihypertensive medication use, requires diverse clinical and public health intervention. BRFSS is a state-based telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years. * Data for this study were taken from the fixed core questions asked every year and the rotating core questions asked every other year. Hypertension awareness ques - tions, included in the rotating core, were asked in odd years. New survey methods were introduced to the BRFSS in 2011; thus, available data from 2011 to 2015 were used for trend analyses. The median state-specific response rates in 2011, 2013, and 2015 were 49. 7% (range = 33. 8%64. 1%), 45. 9% (29. 0%59. 2%), and 47. 2% (33. 9%61. 1%), respectively.  Self-reported diagnosed hypertension was ascertained by an affirmative response to the question Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you have high blood pressure? To determine whether persons with hypertension were being treated, respondents who answered yes were asked Are you currently taking medicine * https: //www. cdc. gov/brfss.  According to the guidelines for the American Association of Public Opinion Research. for your high blood pressure? Hypertension and treatment were assessed by age group (1844 years, 4564 years, and 65 years), sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites [whites]; non-Hispanic blacks [blacks]; Hispanics; non-Hispanic Asians [Asians]; non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders [NH/PIs]; non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Natives [AI/ANs]); and non-Hispanic others [others]), highest level of education attained (less than high school graduate, high school graduate, some college, college graduate or higher), and state of residence. Estimates were directly age-standardized to the 2000 U. S. standard population. Changes over time were assessed using t-tests for the differences from 2011 to 2015. Because of a large difference in the age distribution between persons with hypertension and the general population, both age-standardized and crude estimates were calculated. All analyses were conducted using statistical software to account for the complex sampling design. Overall, 497, 967, 483, 865, and 434, 382 participants were interviewed in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively. After excluding participants who were pregnant (0. 5%0. 6%), missing data for hypertension variables (0. 3%0. 4%) and other covariates (2. 0%2. 8%), the final analytic samples for 2011, 2013 and 2015 were 483, 120 (97% of original sample), 465, 739 (96%), and 418, 317 (96%), respectively. From 2011 to 2015, the overall age-standardized prevalence of self-reported hypertension decreased from 30. 1% to 29. 8% (p = 0. 031) . Hypertension prevalence was higher in 2015 among adults aged 65 years (61. 7%), men (32. 5%), blacks (40. 3%), and persons with less than high school education (35. 1%) compared with younger adults, women (27. 1%), Asians (24. 6%), and persons with higher levels of education (Table 1) . Statistically significant, but minimal, declines in the prevalence of hypertension from 2011 to 2015 were observed among women (28. 1% to 27. 1%), persons aged 65 years (62. 2% to 61. 7%), and persons with some college education (30. 5% to 29. 8%) . In contrast, an increase in hypertension prevalence was observed among persons with less than high school education (34. 1% to 35. 1%) . By state, the age-standardized prevalence of self-reported hyper - tension ranged from 24. 2% in Minnesota to 40. 1% in Mississippi in 2015 (Table 1) . From 2011 to 2015, significant increases in the prevalence of hypertension were observed in five states (Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, North Carolina, and West Virginia) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 220 MMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 1.

In 2015, hypertension prevalence was, in general, higher in the Southern states and lower in the Western states (Figure) . Among participants with self-reported hypertension, the age-standardized prevalences of antihypertensive medication use in 2011, 2013, and 2015 were 63. 0%, 62. 0%, and 61. 8%, respectively (p<0. 001, Table 2) . In 2015, the prevalence of medication use was higher among women (66. 8%), adults aged 65 years (93. 1%), and blacks (60. 7%), and lower among men (58. 5%), adults aged 1844 years (41. 2%), and Hispanics (55. 4%) . From 2011 to 2015, significant decreases in antihy-pertensive medication use among persons with self-reported hypertension were observed among both men and women, persons aged 65 years, whites, and high school graduates, as well as those with any college education. By state, a significant decrease in the prevalence of medication use was observed in Connecticut, Hawaii, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. In 2015, the prevalence of medication use among persons with self-reported hypertension was highest in Louisiana (73. 8%) and lowest in Idaho (51. 1%) . In general, the prevalence of medication use was higher in the Southern states and lower in the Western states (Figure) . Age-standardized estimates were lower than unadjusted estimates for self-reported hypertension (Supplementary Table 1; https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/50226) and substantially lower for antihypertension medication use (Supplementary Table 2; https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/50226) . In addition, statistically significant increases were observed in the unad-justed prevalence of both hypertension (0. 6%), and antihy - pertension medication use from 2011 to 2015; however, the increase in medication use was small in magnitude (0. 1%) . Discussion Among U. S. adults, the age-standardized prevalence of selfreported hypertension and antihypertension medication use changed little from 2011 to 2015. Differences were observed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state of residence. A recent report using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data found no change in the prevalence of hypertension among U. S. adults, from 19992000 (28. 4%) to 20112012 (28. 7%) and 20152016 (29. 0%) (4) . Because of the large number of participants in BRFSS each year, the statistically significant decline in hypertension prevalence from 30. 1% to 29. 8% likely does not represent a meaningful change. However, at the state level, both the age-standardized and unadjusted prevalences of hypertension declined sig - nificantly in Alaska, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Texas and increased in Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, and West Virginia, which suggests that there might be notable changes in hypertension prevalence in these states. The finding that the age-standardized prevalence of antihyper - tensive medication use declined slightly from 2011 (63. 1%) to 2015 (61. 8%) was unexpected, although the trend in unadjusted prevalence had no meaningful change (from 77. 5% to 77. 6%) .

Reduction targets in the prevalence of hypertension and improvements in its management are included in many national initiatives. Healthy People 2020 heart disease and stroke objectives include reducing the proportion of persons in the population with hypertension (target = 26. 9%) and increasing the propor - tion of adults with hypertension who are taking the prescribed medications to lower their blood pressure (target = 69. 5%) .   https: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/ heart-disease-and-stroke. Summary What is already known about this topic? Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Hypertension prevalence and treatment among the U. S. population varies by demographic characteristics and by state. What is added by this report? During 20112015, overall, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension (30. 1% in 2011 to 29. 8% in 2015), as well as the use of antihypertensive medication among persons with self-reported hypertension (63. 0% in 2011 to 61. 8% in 2015), decreased slightly among U. S. adults. However, it is unclear whether these small changes are clinically meaningful. What are the implications for public health practice? Aggressive public health actions to expand existing, effective interventions could enhance improvement in hypertension prevention and management in order to achieve Healthy People 2020 goals. Although improvements have been seen in hypertension management, Healthy People 2020 hypertension targets have yet to be realized. Whereas Healthy People 2020 objectives and targets are set for the United States, data from this report highlighting sociodemographic and geographic differences in the prevalence and treatment of hypertension can be used by state partners to target interventions to improve hypertension management within their populations and communities. Complementary to Healthy People 2020 and other programs, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Million Hearts initiative  seeks to improve hypertension control through diverse, multifaceted interventions (8) . CDC has been working with state and local public health communities to improve hypertension awareness, treatment, and control through multiple strategies within the CDC State Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention programs (9) . In addition to effective, replicable interventions available through these programs, data from this report could be used by public health practitioners to inform hypertension awareness initiatives and management strategies with clinical partners. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, BRFSS data are based on self-report; the lack of direct blood pressure measurement makes it impossible to fully assess hypertension prevalence or control according to cur - rent guidelines. Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the prevalence of awareness among adults with hypertension was 83. 3% during 20112014 (10) . Therefore, nearly 20% of adults with hypertension are unaware of their condition. Second, the representativeness of the BRFSS sample might be affected by median response rates of <50% across the states. Finally, because hypertension is related  https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/partners-progress/champions/index. html.

This report provides the most current self-reported state-level hypertension surveillance data. Hypertension remains a signifi - cant public health problem. Public health and health system interventions might help to improve hypertension awareness and management. A substantial evidence base is available to inform programs at multiple levels and across diverse settings to support improvements in hypertension management. **, Conflict of Interest No conflicts of interest were reported. 1Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 225 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSelf-Reported Receipt of Advice and Action Taken To Reduce Dietary Sodium Among Adults With and Without Hypertension  Nine States and Puerto Rico, 2015 Puthiery Va, DO1, 2; Cecily Luncheon, MD, DrPH2; Angela M. Thompson-Paul, PhD2; Jing Fang, MD2; Robert Merritt, MS2; Mary E. Cogswell, DrPH2 Hypertension is a major cardiovascular disease risk fac - tor (1, 2) . Advice given by health professionals can result in lower sodium intake and lower blood pressure (3) . The 2017 Hypertension Guideline released by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association emphasizes nonpharmacologic approaches, including sodium reduction, as important components of hypertension prevention and treatment (4) . Data from 50, 576 participants in the sodium module of the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in nine states and Puerto Rico were analyzed to determine the prevalence of reported sodium reduction advice and action among participants with and without self-reported hypertension. Among participants with self-reported hyper - tension, adjusted prevalence of receiving sodium reduction advice from a health professional was 41. 9%, compared with 12. 8% among participants without hypertension. Among those with hypertension, adjusted prevalence of reported action to reduce sodium intake was 80. 9% among participants who received advice and 55. 7% among those who did not receive advice. Among participants without hypertension, adjusted prevalence of taking action to reduce sodium intake was 72. 7% among those who received advice and 46. 9% among those who did not receive advice. The provision of advice on sodium reduction by health professionals is associated with respondent action to watch or reduce sodium intake. Fewer than half of patients with hypertension received this advice from their health professionals, a circumstance that represents a substantial missed opportunity to promote hypertension prevention and treatment. BRFSS is an annual state-based, cross-sectional telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years. In 2015, nine states (Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, and Tennessee) and Puerto Rico completed the optional sodium-related behavior mod-ule. Median survey response rate for all states and territories included in this analysis was 51. 3% (range = 42. 6%59. 0%) (5) . Among 63, 955 participants from jurisdictions that implemented the sodium-related behavior module, 55, 857 participants completed it. After 5, 281 participants with missing information on sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body mass index, and reported comorbidities were excluded, data from 50, 576 respondents (90. 5% of all participants) were analyzed. Prevalence of sodium reduction advice and action was estimated by self-reported hypertension status. Hypertension was defined as an affirmative response to the question Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you have high blood pressure? Women who answered yes but only during pregnancy, as well as those who were told that they were borderline high or pre-hypertensive were not included. Receiving health professional advice to reduce sodium intake was defined by an affirmative response to the question Has a doctor or other health professional ever advised you to reduce sodium or salt intake? Action to reduce sodium intake was defined by an affirmative response to the question Are you currently watch - ing or reducing your sodium or salt intake? Descriptive analyses were used to examine population characteristics by hypertension status. Multiple variable logis - tic regression was used to examine characteristics associated with advice and action and to estimate prevalence and 95% confidence intervals using predicted marginals adjusted for selected covariates (6) . Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics (geographic location, sex, age/ethnicity, race, and education) and cardiovascular disease risk factors (smoking, obesity status, and reported associated comorbidities [diabetes, kidney disease, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, or stroke]) . All estimates used sampling weights to account for the complex survey design and nonresponse. Chi-square tests were used to compare prevalence estimates. P-values <0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Participants with self-reported hypertension differed signifi - cantly from participants without hypertension for all charac - teristics examined (p<0. 05 for all characteristics) (Table 1) . Among participants with hypertension compared with those without hypertension, more participants were male (51. 0% versus 48. 6%), aged 65 years (37. 0% versus 11. 9%), non-Hispanic black (13. 9% versus 9. 6%), had less than a high school education (19. 3% versus 11. 6%), were current or for - mer smokers (51. 0% versus 41. 0%), had obesity (45. 1% versus 25. 0%), or reported 1 comorbidity (39. 8% versus 8. 9%) . After adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, the prevalence of having received sodium reduc - tion advice was 41. 9% among participants with hypertension and 12. 8% among those without hypertension (Table 2) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 226 MMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 1.

Obesity defined as body mass index 30 kg/m2. ** Includes self-reported diabetes, kidney disease, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, or stroke. (p<0. 05 for difference overall and in each subgroup) . Among participants with hypertension, the adjusted prevalence of receiving advice varied significantly by geographic location, ranging from 32. 3% (Oregon) to 56. 7% (Puerto Rico), and by sex, race/ethnicity, obesity status, and reported presence of 1 comorbidity, but not by age, level of education, or smoking status. By covariate, receipt of advice was higher, for example, among participants who were female (43. 0%) versus male (40. 8%); non-Hispanic black (54. 1%) and Hispanic (46. 1%) versus non-Hispanic white (39. 1%); who had obesity (46. 6%) versus those who did not have obesity (40. 2%); and who had 1 comorbidity (53. 4%) versus no comorbidity (40. 0%) (Table 2) . Among participants without hypertension, the prevalence of receiving advice ranged from 9. 4% (Oregon) to 22. 0% (Puerto Rico) . Prevalence of receiving advice varied significantly by selected covariate (p<0. 05), except sex. By covariate, the adjusted prevalence of advice was higher among non-Hispanic black (16. 9%) and Hispanic participants (16. 8%) than among non-Hispanic white participants (10. 8%), among participants with a high school diploma (14. 0%) or less than a high school education (14. 9%) than among those with college or more (10. 5%), among current or former smokers (13. 9%) than among never smokers (11. 9%), among those who had obesity (17. 4%) versus those who did not (10. 6%), and among those who reported 1 comorbidity (26. 6%) than among those who did not (10. 0%) (Table 2) . Overall, participants with hypertension who received advice had the highest adjusted prevalence of taking action to reduce sodium intake (80. 9%), followed by those without hyperten - sion who received advice (72. 7%), those with hypertension who did not receive advice (55. 7%), and those without hyper - tension who did not receive advice (46. 9%) (p<0. 05 for overall comparison across the four groups) (Table 3) . Discussion In 2015, fewer than half (42%) of BRFSS participants with self-reported hypertension from nine states and Puerto Rico (range = 32% [Oregon] to 57% [Puerto Rico]) reported receiving sodium reduction advice from a health professional independent of sociodemographic characteristics and car - diovascular disease risk factors. Among respondents without hypertension, 13% reported receiving advice to reduce sodium intake (range = 9% [Oregon] to 22% [Puerto Rico]) . Yet, among participants with hypertension who received advice, 81% reported taking action to reduce sodium, compared with 56% of those with hypertension who did not receive advice. Similarly, among participants without hypertension 73% of those who received advice to reduce sodium intake reported taking action to reduce sodium, compared with 47% of those who did not receive advice. In this analysis, among participants with and without hypertension, receiving sodium reduction advice from a health professional was associated with reported respondent action to watch or reduce sodium intake.

Significant interactions occurred between hypertension status and age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, obesity status, and comorbidities.  Hypertension was defined as an affirmative response to the question Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that you have high blood pressure?  Across all participating locations and selected covariates, a higher prevalence of advice was reported among participants with hypertension compared with those without hypertension (pvalue <0. 05) .  p-value obtained by Wald F test and p-value <0. 05 were used to identify statistically significant differences in prevalence of advice among subgroups with hypertension and without hypertension. ** Obesity defined as body mass index 30 kg/m2.

Despite these differences, results were gener - ally consistent with previous studies that found respondents with hypertension were more likely to receive advice and take action (7) and that the prevalence of taking action was highest among those who received advice (8) . Fewer than half of adults with hypertension in most loca - tions, and even fewer adults without hypertension, reported receiving sodium reduction advice. Geographic patterns of prevalence of receiving advice appears to correspond with the pattern of self-reported high blood pressure diagnosis.

Similar to previous reports, in this study, the prevalence of receiving advice was significantly higher among persons with hypertension and obesity or other cardiovascular diseaseassociated comorbid - ity than among those with hypertension without these other risk factors. However, among adults with an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, but without hypertension, reported advice to reduce sodium intake was <30%. Also consistent with earlier findings, more adults who received advice from a health professional to reduce sodium intake reported watching or reducing their sodium intake, irrespective of hypertension Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / February 23, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 7 229 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Hypertension is a major cardiovascular disease risk factor for which sodium reduction can be beneficial. Provision of sodium reduction advice by health professionals to persons with hypertension reduces their reported sodium intake. What is added by this report? Among participants with self-reported hypertension, the prevalence of receiving advice to reduce sodium intake from a health professional was 42% compared with 13% among participants without hypertension. Among those with hyper - tension, 81% of those who received advice to reduce sodium intake reported taking action to reduce sodium intake, compared with 56% of those with hypertension who did not receive this advice. What are the implications for public health practice? Most patients do not receive clinical advice to reduce sodium intake. Increasing the percentage of patients who receive this advice from their health care provider might provide increased opportunities for hypertension prevention and treatment. status or cardiovascular risk factors (7) . Self-reported action to watch or reduce sodium intake might not result in achieving clinically meaningful sodium reduction (10); however, these findings suggest that a health professionals advice can signifi-cantly affect awareness. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, BRFSS data are self-reported and subject to recall and social desirability bias, which affects prevalence estimates. Second, questions from BRFSS do not provide the extent of health professional advice or verify or detail the types of actions taken by respondents who report actively watching or reducing their sodium intake. Therefore, these questions might serve as a proxy for awareness of the need for sodium reduction rather than a measure of behavior change. Finally, responses were limited to nine states and Puerto Rico that elected to apply the sodium module during the 2015 BRFSS, and where response rates were approximately 50%; therefore, these results might not be generalizable to all U. S. adults and could be subject to response bias. Despite limitations, this report estimates sodium reduction advice and action using the latest BRFSS data and might provide a baseline for current practice as well as demonstrate opportunities for increasing the advice provided. The findings from this analysis indicate that a higher percentage of BRFSS participants who reported receiving sodium reduction advice from a health professional reported taking action, across hypertension status and cardiovascular risk groups, underscoring the importance of health professional advice on potentially influencing sodium reduction aware - ness and behavior. Yet, fewer than half of respondents with self-reported hypertension and fewer respondents without hypertension reported receiving advice. In accordance with the 2017 hypertension guidelines (4) encouraging lifestyle modification, health professionals can encourage healthy food choices and support consumer and population efforts to reduce sodium intake, highlighting a potential opportunity for hypertension prevention and treatment.

Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by HBV, which is transmitted through blood, semen, or other body fluids and is usually an acute, self-limiting illness in adults; however, some infected adults develop chronic HBV infection. HBV infection is pre - ventable by vaccination. The Florida Department of Health (DOH-Florida) confirmed the local surveillance data; although Pasco County has fewer than half a million residents, in 2016, it had the highest number (87) and rate (17. 28 per 100, 000 population) of acute HBV infections among all Florida coun - ties. From 2011 to 2016, the number of acute HBV-infected persons in Pasco County who met the national case definition* increased from 1. 5 to 17. 28 per 100, 000 residents (p<0. 001) . In mid-July 2016, DOH-Florida and Pasco County Department of Health (DOH-Pasco) epidemiologists initi - ated weekly conference calls to discuss strategies for prevent-ing further infections within the county. Epidemiologic case surveillance data were reviewed to determine which risk factors were driving the increases in acute HBV infections. As of February 2017, among 275 cases of acute HBV infec - tion reported in Pasco County during 20112016, risk factor information was ascertained for 221 (80%) patients. Among these, more than half (N = 113; 51%) reported some type of drug use, including 86 (39%) who reported injection drug use in the 6 months preceding symptom onset (Table) and 42 (19%) who reported incarceration for 24 hours during that time. Overall, 55% of reported HBV infections occurred in men and 45% in women. The observed increase in acute HBV infection related to injection drug use in Pasco County was similar to that seen in other Southern urban counties (1) and paralleled national trends in opioid use and overdose deaths (2) . Since September 2016, DOH-Pasco epidemiology staff members have been collaborating with HIV and Sexually T ransmitted Diseases program personnel and clinical staff to establish targeted outreach for testing and hepatitis B * https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nndss/conditions/hepatitis-b-acute/ case-definition/2012/. vaccination programs for persons at risk, including at a metha - done clinic, at free health care clinics, and via a mobile medical unit operated by the Pasco County Public Defenders Office. Law enforcement personnel helped to identify areas where drug users congregate, and DOH-Pasco worked with local jails and hospitals to identify and test persons who are at the highest risk for acquiring HBV infection. These efforts have resulted in administration of >300 hepatitis B vaccine doses in communities with persons at high risk for infection. One local hospital is now sending specimens to CDC for molecular characterization of HBV to delineate transmission networks in the county, using CDCs Global Health, Outbreak, and Surveillance Technology (3) . HBV surveillance data available for JanuaryApril 2017 indicated an 80% decrease in the number of acute cases of HBV infection compared with the same period in 2016. The decline likely represents a saturation of HBV among risk populations, the impact of hepatitis B vaccination and other interventions, or a combination of these factors. Pasco County is continuing enhanced HBV surveil - lance and prevention activities.

Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the noninstitutionalized U. S. civilian population and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey Sample adult component. Percentages were 3-year averages age-adjusted to the projected 2000 U. S. population as the standard population, using three age groups: 6574, 7584, and 85 years.  Based on the survey question, During the past 12 months, have you had a flu vaccination? Annual calendaryear estimates of immunizations differ from seasonal flu immunization totals, which reflect vaccinations obtained during the flu season.  Poverty status is based on family income and family size using the U. S. Census Bureau poverty thresholds. Family income was imputed where missing. During 20142016, 69. 2% of all older adults, aged 65 years, had received an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months. The percentage of older adults with family income 200% poverty level who had received an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months significantly increased from 67. 9% during 19992001 to 72. 2% during 20142016. During the same period, the changes from 55. 7% to 60. 8% among those at the <100% poverty level and from 60. 3% to 62. 9% for those at the 100% to <200% poverty level were not statistically significant. During both periods, older adults with income 200% poverty level were significantly more likely to receive an influenza vaccine compared with those with lower family income.
