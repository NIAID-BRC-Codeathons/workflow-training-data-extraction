U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCurrent Cigarette Smoking Among Adults  United States, 2016 Ahmed Jamal, MBBS1; Elyse Phillips, MPH1; Andrea S. Gentzke, PhD1; David M. Homa, PhD1; Stephen D. Babb, MPH1; Brian A. King, PhD1; Linda J. Neff, PhD1 The U. S. Surgeon General has concluded that the burden of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products (1) . Cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among U. S. adults, and about 480, 000 U. S. deaths per year are caused by cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (1) . To assess progress toward the Healthy People 2020 target of reducing the proportion of U. S. adults aged 18 years who smoke cigarettes to 12. 0% (objective TU-1. 1), * CDC analyzed data from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) . In 2016, the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults was 15. 5%, which was a significant decline from 2005 (20. 9%); however, no significant change has occurred since 2015 (15. 1%) . In 2016, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among adults who were male, aged 2564 years, American Indian/Alaska Native or multiracial, had a General Education Development (GED) certificate, lived below the federal poverty level, lived in the Midwest or South, were uninsured or insured through Medicaid, had a disability/ limitation, were lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB), or had serious psychological distress. During 20052016, the percentage of ever smokers who quit smoking increased from 50. 8% to 59. 0%. Proven population-based interventions are critical to reducing the health and economic burden of smoking-related diseases among U. S. adults, particularly among subpopula - tions with the highest smoking prevalences (1, 2) . NHIS is an annual, nationally representative in-person survey of the noninstitutionalized U. S. civilian population. The NHIS core questionnaire is administered to a randomly selected adult in the household (the sample adult) . In 2016, the NHIS was administered to 33, 028 adults aged 18 years; * https: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/tobacco-use/ objectives. the response rate was 54. 3%. Current cigarette smokers were respondents who reported having smoked 100 cigarettes dur - ing their lifetime and were smoking every day or some days at the time of interview. Former smokers were respondents who reported having smoked 100 cigarettes during their lifetime but were not smoking at the time of interview. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was calculated among daily smokers. Quit ratios were defined as the ratio of former smokers to ever smokers (i. e. , persons who had smoked 100 cigarettes during their lifetime) . Data were weighted to adjust for differences in the prob - ability of selection and nonresponse and to provide nationally representative estimates.

Limitations in performing activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing? Limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctors office or shopping? Any disability/limitation was defined as a yes response pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations listed (e. g. , vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living) . A random sample of half the respondents from the 2016 Person File were asked about disability/limitation. Disability/limitation estimates (%, population estimate) were obtained using the specific adult disability weight.  Starting in 2013, sexual orientation questions were added to NHIS for the first time. To determine sexual orientation, adult respondents were asked, Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself? with a response options of gay (lesbian or gay for female respondents), straight, that is, not gay (not lesbian or gay for female respondents), bisexual, something else, and I dont know the answer.  The six-question K6 scale was developed to identify persons with a high likelihood of having a diagnosable mental illness and associated functional limitations. The K6 scale asked how often during the past 30 days the respondents felt a) so sad that nothing could cheer them up; b) nervous; c) restless or fidgety; d) hopeless; e) that everything was an effort; and f) worthless. Responses were on a five-point Likert scale ranging from none of the time to all of the time. For each question, a value of zero, one, two, three, or four was assigned to the response none of the time, a little of the time, some of the time, most of the time, or all of the time, respectively. Responses to the six items were summed to yield a K6 score between 0 and 24, with a score of 13 or higher indicating serious psychological distress.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 55 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDifferences between groups were assessed using a Wald F test, with statistical significance defined as p<0. 05. Population counts were estimated from extrapolated probability weights, rounded down to the nearest 10, 000 persons. Quit ratios were calculated overall and by age group. Logistic regression was used to assess overall trends in prevalence, cigarettes smoked per day, and quit ratios during 20052016, controlling for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. T-tests were performed to examine differences between 2015 and 2016. In 2016, 15. 5% (37. 8 million) of U. S. adults were cur - rent cigarette smokers (Table) . Overall, smoking prevalence did not change significantly from 2015 (15. 1%) to 2016 (15. 5%) . Current cigarette smoking prevalence was higher among males (17. 5%) than among females (13. 5%) . By age group, prevalence was higher among adults aged 2544 years (17. 6%) and 4564 years (18. 0%) than among those aged 1824 years (13. 1%) or 65 years (8. 8%) . Prevalence was highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives (31. 8%) and lowest among non-Hispanic Asians (9. 0%) . Among adults aged 25 years, prevalence was highest among persons with a GED (40. 6%) and lowest among those with a graduate degree (4. 5%) . Prevalence was higher among persons living below the poverty level (25. 3%) than those at or above this level (14. 3%) . By region, prevalence was higher in the Midwest (18. 5%) and South (16. 9%) than the West (12. 3%) or Northeast (13. 3%) . By insurance status, prevalence was higher among Medicaid enrollees (25. 3%) and uninsured adults (28. 4%) than among those covered by private insurance (11. 8%), Medicare only (10. 2%), or other public insurance (19. 8%) . Prevalence was higher among adults with a disability/limitation (21. 2%) than among those with no disability/limitation (14. 4%) . Prevalence was higher among LGB adults (20. 5%) than among hetero - sexual adults (15. 3%) and among adults with serious psycho - logical distress (35. 8%) than among those without serious psychological distress (14. 7%) . Among current smokers, the proportion of daily smokers was 76. 1% in 2016, which declined from 2005 (80. 8%, p-value for trend <0. 05) (data not shown) . Whereas mean number of cigarettes smoked per day declined from 2005 (16. 7) to 2016 (14. 1) among daily smokers (p-value for trend <0. 05), no change occurred between 2015 (14. 2) and 2016 (14. 1) (data not shown) . During 20052016, increases occurred in the proportion of daily smokers who smoked 19 cigarettes per day (from 16. 4% to 25. 0%) or 1019 (from 36. 0% to 39. 0%) cigarettes per day (Figure 1) . At the same time, decreases occurred in the proportion of daily smokers who smoked 2029 (from 34. 9% to 28. 4%) or 30 (from 12. 7% to 7. 5%) cigarettes per day during 20052016 (p-value for trend <0. 05) . No significant changes in any category of number of cigarettes smoked per day occurred during 20152016. Summary What is already known about this topic? The U. S. Surgeon General has concluded that the burden of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products. Cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among U. S. adults, and about 480, 000 deaths per year are caused by cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. What is added by this report? The proportion of U. S. adults who smoke cigarettes declined from 20. 9% in 2005 (45. 1 million smokers) to 15. 5% in 2016 (37. 8 million smokers), but cigarette smoking prevalence did not change significantly during 20152016. Sociodemographic disparities in cigarette smoking persist. During 20052016, increases occurred in the proportion of adult ever smokers who quit smoking (50. 8% to 59. 0%) . What are the implications for public health practice? Proven population-based interventions, including tobacco price increases, comprehensive smoke-free laws, high-impact anti-tobacco media campaigns, and barrier-free access to tobacco cessation counseling and medications, are critical to reducing cigarette smoking and smoking-related disease and death among U. S. adults, particularly among subpopulations with the highest smoking prevalence. The overall quit ratio increased from 50. 8% in 2005 to 59. 0% in 2016 (p<0. 05) . During 20052016, the largest increase in quit ratios occurred among adults aged 2544 years (from 37. 0% to 48. 9% [p<0. 05]) (Figure 2) . Discussion During 20052016, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among U. S. adults declined from 20. 9% to 15. 5%, and the proportion of ever smokers who had quit increased. However, during 20152016, cigarette smoking prevalence did not change significantly. In 2016, 37. 8 million U. S. adults were current cigarette smokers, and marked sociodemographic differences in smoking prevalence persist. Proven populationbased interventions, including tobacco price increases, compre - hensive smoke-free laws, anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, and barrier-free access to tobacco cessation counseling and medications, are critical to reduce cigarette smoking and smoking-related disease and death among U. S. adults, par - ticularly among subpopulations with the highest prevalences. The observed disparities in smoking prevalence are likely attributable to multiple factors (1) . Racial or ethnic differ - ences might be partly explained by sociocultural influences and norms related to the acceptability of tobacco use and variations in exposure to tobacco marketing, whereas dispari - ties by education might be partly attributable to variations in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 56 MMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE.

Variations in access to evidence-based tobacco ces - sation treatments through insurance coverage might partially explain the differences observed across insurance types (5) . Smoking prevalence was higher among persons with severe psychological distress (6, 7), potentially because of higher levels of addiction and dependence, lack of financial resources, less access to cessation treatments, and stressful living conditions among these persons (6, 7) . Assessing the smoking status of all patients served in psychiatric inpatient and outpatient settings, integrating evidence-based cessation interventions into mental health treatment plans, and implementing tobacco-free cam - pus policies in mental health care facilities could help reduce smoking in this population (6, 7) . During 20052016, an increasing proportion of adults who ever smoked cigarettes had quit smoking. However, following consecutive significant annual declines during 20132014 and 20142015 (8), no change in smoking prevalence was observed between 2015 and 2016. Moreover, longstanding declines in the proportion of daily smokers who smoked 20 cigarettes per day have stalled in recent years. These findings could be the result of multiple factors, including slowed progress in the adoption of proven interventions (9), or increased nicotine dependence from the concurrent use of other tobacco products (1) .

Limitations in performing activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, Does [person] have difficulty dressing or bathing? Limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctors office or shopping? Any disability/limitation was defined as a yes response pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations listed (e. g. , vision, hearing, cognition, movement, activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living) . A random sample of half the respondents from the 2016 Person File were asked about disability/limitation. Disability/limitation estimates (%, population estimate) were obtained used the specific adult disability weight.  Response options provided on the National Health Interview Survey were straight, that is, not gay for men, and straight, that is, not gay or lesbian for women.  The Kessler psychological distress scale is a series of six questions that ask about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, and feeling like everything is an effort in the past 30 days. Participants were asked to respond on a Likert Scale ranging between None of the time (score = 0) and All of the time (score = 4) . Responses were summed over the six questions; any person with a score of 13 was coded as having serious psychological distress, and respondents with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, smoking status was self-reported and not validated by biochemical testing; however, self-reported smoking status is correlated with serum cotinine levels (10) . Second, because NHIS does not include institutionalized populations and per - sons in the military, results are not generalizable to these groups. Third, the NHIS response rate of 54. 3% might have resulted in nonresponse bias, even after adjustment for nonresponse. Fourth, the assessment of broad racial/ethnic populations (e. g. , Asians and Hispanics) can mask differences in smoking preva - lence among subgroups of these populations. Finally, these estimates might differ from those reported from other surveys. These differences can be partially explained by varying survey  https: //www. cdc. gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6530a1. htm. methodologies and definitions of current smoking; however, trends in prevalence are comparable across surveys (1) . Sustained implementation of comprehensive state tobacco control programs can accelerate progress toward reducing adult smoking prevalence (2) . Targeted interventions are warranted to reach subpopulations with the highest incidence of use, and can result in substantial reductions in tobacco-related disease and death and billions of dollars in savings from averted medical costs (1) .

Dodd, MPH2; Jacek M. Mazurek, MD, PhD2 In 2015, an estimated 18. 4 million U. S. adults had current asthma, and 3, 396 adult asthma deaths were reported (1) . An estimated 11%21% of asthma deaths might be attributable to occupational exposures (2) . To describe asthma mortality among persons aged 1564 years, * CDC analyzed multiple cause-of-death data for 19992016 and industry and occupation information collected from 26 states for the years 1999, 2003, 2004, and 2007 2012. Proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) for asthma among persons aged 1564 years were calculated. During 19992016, a total of 14, 296 (42. 9%) asthma deaths occurred among males and 19, 011 (57. 1%) occurred among females. Based on an estimate that 11%21% of asthma deaths might be related to occupational exposures, during this 18-year period, 1, 5733, 002 asthma deaths in males and 2, 0913, 992 deaths in females might have resulted from occupational exposures. Some of these deaths might have been averted by instituting measures to prevent potential workplace exposures. The annual age-adjusted asthma death rate** per 1 mil - lion persons aged 1564 years declined from 13. 59 in 1999 to 9. 34 in 2016 (p<0. 001) among females, and from 9. 14 (1999) to 7. 78 (2016) (p<0. 05) among males. The highest significantly elevated asthma PMRs for males were for those in the food, beverage, and tobacco products manufacturing industry (1. 82) and for females were for those in the social assistance industry (1. 35) and those in community and social services occupations (1. 46) . Elevated asthma mortality among workers in certain industries and occupations underscores the importance of optimal asthma management and identification and prevention of potential workplace exposures.

States represent the state where the death took place.  PMR was defined as the observed number of deaths from asthma in a specified industry/occupation, divided by the expected number of deaths from asthma. The expected number of deaths was the total number of deaths in industry or occupation of interest multiplied by a proportion defined as the number of asthma deaths in all industries and/or occupations, divided by the total number of deaths in all industries/occupations. The asthma PMRs for each sex were internally adjusted by 5-year age groups and race. ** Age-adjusted death rates were calculated by applying age-specific death rates to the 2000 U. S. Census standard population age distribution. https: //wonder. cdc. gov/wonder/help/mcd. html#Age-AdjustedRates. persons aged 1564 years. Asthma deaths were identified from death certificates using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision underlying cause-of-death codes J45 (asthma) and J46 (status asthmaticus) . Death rates per 1 million persons aged 1564 years by sex, race, ethnicity, and year were age-adjusted using the 2000 U. S. Census standard population. Time trends were assessed using a first-order autoregressive linear regression model to account for the serial correlation. Industry and occupa - tion information available from 26 states for the years 1999, 2003, 2004, and 20072012 was coded using the U. S. Census 2000 Industry and Occupation Classification System. PMRs, adjusted by 5-year age groups and race, were generated by industry and occupation for males and females. In addition, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assuming Poisson distribution of the data. Retired, unemployed, and nonpaid workers and those with information that was unknown or not reported for industry or occupation were excluded from PMR analyses. During 19992016, a total of 33, 307 U. S. decedents aged 1564 years had asthma or status asthmaticus assigned as the underlying cause of death (Table 1) for an overall death rate of 8. 89 per 1 million persons. The highest asthma death rates were among adults aged 5564 years (16. 32 per 1 million persons), females (9. 95 per 1 million persons), persons who were not Hispanic or Latino (9. 39 per 1 million), and blacks or African Americans (25. 60 per 1 million persons) . The age-adjusted asthma death rate per 1 million persons aged 1564 years decreased 24. 6% from 11. 41 in 1999 to 8. 60 in 2016 (p<0. 01) . The age-adjusted asthma death rates among females aged 1564 years decreased from 13. 59 per 1 million in 1999 to 9. 34 in 2016 (p<0. 001), and among males decreased from 9. 14 (1999) to 7. 78 (2016) (p<0. 05) . By state, annualized age-adjusted asthma death rates ranged from 4. 59 per 1 million in Maine to 14. 72 in the District of Columbia for males and from 6. 70 per 1 million in North Dakota to 15. 30 in Mississippi for females (Figure) .

Discussion The annual number of asthma deaths among persons aged 1564 years has declined significantly from 1999 through 2016, most likely reflecting improvements in asthma manage - ment and effectiveness of prevention efforts (3, 4) . For example, replacing powdered latex gloves with powder-free natural rub - ber latex or nonlatex gloves reduced latex allergen exposure and substantially reduced work-related asthma*** among health care workers (4) . Differences in asthma mortality by age, sex, and race/ethnicity have been previously reported (5) . Based on an estimate that 11%21% of asthma deaths might be attribut - able to occupational exposures (2), an estimated 3, 6646, 994 asthma deaths during 19992016 (1, 5733, 002 among males and 2, 0913, 992 among females) might have been job-related, and therefore potentially preventable. Female workers in the health care industry and male work - ers in the construction industry accounted for the highest industry-related numbers of asthma deaths. The PMRs were significantly elevated among males in the food, beverage, and tobacco products manufacturing, other retail trade, and miscel - laneous manufacturing industries; and among females in the social assistance industry and in the community and social ser - vices occupations. A higher proportion of females with current asthma and a high frequency of exposures associated with workrelated respiratory diseases have been observed in the health care and social assistance industries (6, 7) . National survey data indicate that approximately 9. 1% (1. 3 million) of 13. 9 million female workers in the health care and social assistance indus - tries, and 4. 2% (394, 000) of 9. 4 million male workers in the construction industry, have current asthma. Approximately 13. 4% of health care and social assistance workers, 51. 1% of construction workers, 31. 8% of food manufacturing workers, 36. 1% of beverage and tobacco product manufacturing work - ers, 40. 0% of miscellaneous manufacturing workers, 21. 5% of retail trade workers, and 3. 7% of community and social services workers are frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes in the workplace (6) . Workplace exposures to asthma-causing agents, such as cleaners, disinfectants, antibiotics, natural rubber latex among health care workers, and welding fumes and isocyanates (e. g. , paints) among construction workers have been associated with work-related asthma (8, 9) . Higher *** Work-related asthma includes occupational asthma (i. e. , new-onset asthma caused by factors related to work) and work-exacerbated asthma (i. e. , preexisting or concurrent asthma worsened by factors related to work) . https: //www. cdc. gov/niosh/topics/asthma/default. html.  https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/eworld/Grouping/Asthma/97.

PMRs in certain groups might also be explained in part by workers leaving employment in industries and occupations with workplace exposures that exacerbate their asthma and moving to jobs with fewer workplace exposures (10) . Likewise, retired, unemployed, and nonpaid workers might have left the workforce because of workplace exposures. Differences in asthma mortality by industry and occupa - tion underscore the need for identifying workplace exposures, early diagnosis, and treatment and management of asthma cases, especially among industries and occupations with higher mortality. Pharmaceutical treatment of asthma related to occupational exposures is similar to that for asthma that is not work-related (3) . Early identification and elimination of exposures is the preferred means of primary prevention to reduce asthma related to occupational exposures; however, reduction of exposure might be considered when elimination of exposures is not possible (4) . Establishing an accurate diag - nosis and recommending appropriate management for workers with asthma related to occupational exposures is necessary to improve outcomes and could prevent asthma deaths (4) . The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, asthma and status asthmaticus diagnoses could not be validated. It is possible that some decedents were misdiagnosed. However, given the potential impact of asthma diagnosis and status asthmaticus on patients lives, it seems likely that asthma would be accurately recorded on death certificates. Second, no information was available to assess whether workplace exposures triggered asthma attacks that led directly to death. Some attacks might have been triggered by exposures outside of the work environment. Third, to the extent that asthma attacks were triggered by workplace expo - sures, industry and occupation information reported on death certificates might not be the industry and occupation in which workplace exposures actually occurred because guidelines for reporting industry and occupation on death certificates**** instruct recorders to report decedents usual industry and occupation (i. e. , the type of job the individual was engaged in for most of his or her working life) . Fourth, no work history was available to assess changes in employment. Retired and **** https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/misc/hb_occup. pdf.

States represent the state where the death took place.  PMR is defined as the observed number of deaths from asthma in a specified industry/occupation, divided by the expected number of deaths from asthma. The expected number of deaths is the total number of deaths in industry or occupation of interest multiplied by a proportion defined as the number of asthma deaths in all industries or occupations, divided by the total number of deaths in all industries/occupations. The asthma PMRs were internally adjusted by 5-year age groups and race. CIs were calculated assuming Poisson distribution of the data.  Retired, unemployed, and unpaid (229 males and 687 females) and unknown or not reported (90 males and 78 females) workers in industries, and retired, students, volunteers, homemakers and unemployed (233 males and 688 females) and unknown or not reported (78 males and 68 females) occupations were excluded from PMR analyses. ** Statistically significant elevated PMR unemployed persons might have left the workforce because of severe asthma in relation to work.

In 2015, a total of 3, 396 asthma deaths were reported among adults aged 18 years in the United States. An estimated 11%21% of asthma deaths might be attributable to occupa - tional exposures. Asthma deaths are preventable with proper asthma management and rapid response to asthma attacks. What is added by this report? Among U. S. adults aged 1564 years, 33, 307 deaths from asthma occurred during 19992016, including an estimated 3, 6646, 994 (approximately 204389 annually) that could be attributable to occupational exposures and were therefore potentially preventable. The highest asthma death rates were among adults aged 5564 years, females, persons who were not Hispanic or Latino, and blacks or African Americans. By industry, asthma mortality was significantly elevated among males in food, beverage, and tobacco products manufacturing, other retail trade, and miscellaneous manufacturing, and among females in social assistance. By occupation, asthma mortality was significantly elevated among females in community and social services. What are the implications for public health practice? Elevated asthma mortality among male and female workers in certain industries and occupations highlights the importance of optimal asthma management, and identification and preven - tion of workplace exposures.

Anderson, PhD1, 2; Elizabeth C. Ailes, PhD2; Melissa Danielson, MSPH3; Jennifer N. Lind, PharmD2; Sherry L. Farr, PhD2; Cheryl S. Broussard, PhD2; Sarah C. Tinker, PhD2 Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neu - rodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals across the lifespan. ADHD medication use among pregnant women is increasing (1), but consensus about the safety of ADHD medi - cation use during pregnancy is lacking. Given that nearly half of U. S. pregnancies are unintended (2), and early pregnancy is a critical period for fetal development, examining trends in ADHD medication prescriptions among reproductive-aged women is important to quantify the population at risk for potential exposure. CDC used the T ruven Health MarketScan Commercial Database* for the period 20032015 to estimate the percentage of women aged 1544 years with private employer-sponsored insurance who filled prescriptions for ADHD medications each year. The percentage of reproduc - tive-aged women who filled at least one ADHD medication prescription increased 344% from 2003 (0. 9% of women) to 2015 (4. 0% of women) . In 2015, the most frequently filled medications were mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine, and methylphenidate. Prescribing ADHD medications to reproductive-aged women is increasingly common; additional research on ADHD medication safety during pregnancy is warranted to inform women and their health care providers about any potential risks associated with ADHD medication exposure before and during pregnancy. CDC used the T ruven Health MarketScan Commercial Database to examine outpatient pharmacy prescription drug claims for ADHD medications among reproductive-aged (1544 years) women during 20032015. These data repre - sent a convenience sample of persons with private employersponsored insurance and their dependents in the United States. Demographic data are available for all persons enrolled at any point during the year, regardless of whether a claim is filed, and are linkable to submitted outpatient pharmacy claims. This analysis was restricted to women aged 1544 years with 11 months of enrollment in a private health insurance plan that included prescription drug coverage during the year of interest. Outpatient pharmacy claims for ADHD medications were identified using national drug codes, irrespective of the indication for use. Data were analyzed to assess the annual percentage of reproductive-aged women who filled any ADHD * T ruven Health Analytics, Atlanta, Georgia. medication prescription during 20032015, as well as by age group, U. S. geographic region, and medication class. To examine time trends, the percentage change in the percentage of reproductive-aged women dispensed ADHD medications from 2003 to 2015 was estimated. Among women who filled at least one ADHD medication prescription in the given year, CDC examined the distribution of specific medications and average number of prescriptions filled per year. Approximately 2. 36. 8 million privately insured reproduc - tive-aged women constituted the analytic sample each year during 20032015 (median = 4. 6 million) . The percentage of reproductive-aged women with private employer-sponsored insurance who filled a prescription for any ADHD medica - tion increased 344% from 2003 (0. 9%) to 2015 (4. 0%) . The increase in the percentage of women prescribed ADHD medications was confined to a rise in the prescribing of stimu - lant medications (388% increase from 2003 to 2015); the percentage of women prescribed the nonstimulant medication atomoxetine was stable over time (0% change from 2003 to 2015) (Figure) . The percentage of reproductive-aged women who filled a prescription for any ADHD medication increased over time for all age groups and geographic regions (Table 1) . In 2015, the highest percentage of ADHD medication prescriptions filled among reproductive-aged women were for those aged 1519 (5. 4%), 2024 (5. 5%), and 2529 (4. 0%) years. From 2003 to 2015, the largest increase in ADHD prescriptions filled occurred among women aged 2529 years (700%) . In 2015, the highest percentage of ADHD medication prescriptions were filled by reproductive-aged women who resided in the South (4. 8%) and North Central (4. 0%) U. S. regions; the larg - est increase from 2003 to 2015 occurred in the South (380%) . In 2015, among reproductive-aged women who filled any ADHD prescription, 60. 8% filled a prescription for mixed amphetamine salts, 26. 7% filled a prescription for lisdexam - fetamine, and 18. 1% filled a prescription for methylphenidate (Table 2) . Among reproductive-aged women who filled any ADHD medication prescription in the given year, the percent - age who filled a prescription for mixed amphetamine salts and  In this analysis, stimulant medications include amphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and pemoline.

Abbreviation: SD = standard deviation. * Women aged 1544 years enrolled 11 months per year in a plan that includes prescription drug coverage were defined as eligible.   The same woman could be included in multiple years of data.  Percentage of privately insured reproductive-aged women with each ADHD prescription medication dispensed was calculated among eligible women with at least one prescription filled for any ADHD medication in the given year.  Not mutually exclusive; percentages might sum to >100% because multiple medications might have been prescribed to individual women within 1 calendar year. The first eight medications are stimulant ADHD medications and the last medication (atomoxetine) is a nonstimulant ADHD medication; these were the medications searched for in this analysis. ** Lisdexamfetamine was first approved by the FDA in 2007; pemoline was discontinued in 2005.  Among privately insured reproductive-aged women with at least one ADHD medication filled; this calculation is based on the average number of prescriptions filled each year from any type of ADHD medication. lisdexamfetamine increased from 2003 to 2015, while the percentage who filled a prescription for methylphenidate and atomoxetine decreased over the same period. Among women who filled any ADHD medication prescription, the average number of prescriptions filled for any ADHD medication per year rose from an average of 5. 5 prescriptions in 2003 (standard deviation [SD] = 4. 4) to 7. 2 in 2015 (SD = 5. 1) . Discussion The percentage of reproductive-aged women with private employer-sponsored insurance that included drug coverage who filled an ADHD medication prescription increased 344% from 2003 to 2015. In 2015, 4. 0% of reproductive-aged women in this large convenience sample filled an ADHD medi - cation prescription. A rise in stimulant ADHD medication prescriptions accounted for this increase; prescriptions for the nonstimulant atomoxetine have remained stable since 2003. The substantial increase in the percentage of reproductive-aged women filling ADHD medication prescriptions from 2003 to 2015, across age groups and U. S. geographic regions, is of public health concern given the high percentage of unin - tended pregnancies (2) and uncertainty concerning the safety of ADHD medication exposure before and during pregnancy (3) . In studies with samples of U. S. pregnant women, ADHD medication use estimates have ranged from 0. 4% (20002013 data) (4) to 1. 3% (2013 data) (1) . Although evidence is limited and findings are mixed (3), ADHD medication use during pregnancy might be linked to increased risk for poor pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (5, 6) . The safety of ADHD medications with regard to risk for birth defects is largely unknown, with only one sufficiently powered published study (4) . ADHD medication prescription trends among reproductiveaged women in non-U. S. populations align with CDCs findings that an increased percentage of women are filling ADHD medication prescriptions, with the highest percentage among younger reproductive-aged women. In an analysis of 20032008 data from the United Kingdom (7), the preva - lence of ADHD medication prescriptions increased over time among women aged 1824 years (from 0. 12 to 0. 34 per 1, 000 women) and women aged 2545 years (from 0. 01 to 0. 05 per 1, 000 women) . In an analysis of Canadian adults during 20052015 (8), the prevalence of ADHD medica - tion prescriptions increased over time for men and women aged 1825 years (from 0. 7% in 2005 to 3. 2% in 2015) and 2635 years (from 0. 3% in 2005 to 1. 6% in 2015) . CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 69 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionestimates were higher than those from the United Kingdom and Canadian data sets, which might reflect higher ADHD medication prescribing in the United States or differences in the types of ADHD medications either prescribed across countries or included in the analyses. Most adult ADHD medication use prevalence estimates use older data (5, 7), whereas results from this analysis demonstrate a continued increase in ADHD medication prescribing into 2015. CDCs findings indicate that mixed amphetamine salts, lis - dexamfetamine, and methylphenidate are among the ADHD medications most commonly prescribed to privately insured U. S. reproductive-aged women. In the United States, mixed amphetamine salts and methylphenidate are the most fre - quently prescribed ADHD medications among children (9) and pregnant women (1) . Data from this analysis similarly suggests that mixed amphetamine salts and methylphenidate are two of the three most commonly prescribed medications among reproductive-aged women. However, in this analysis, lisdexamfetamine, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007, was the second most commonly prescribed medication among reproductive-aged women. This is noteworthy given that most analyses that have examined ADHD medication safety among women before and during pregnancy have not included lisdexamfetamine as a medica - tion of interest (36) . The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi - tations. First, although this analysis included 2. 36. 8 million reproductive-aged women per year, data are from a convenience sample of privately insured women with prescription drug coverage. Approximately 45% of U. S. births occur to women with Medicaid coverage (10); ADHD medication prevalence estimates might differ between publicly and privately insured women of reproductive age. Second, data are based on out - patient pharmacy claims and no information is available on women who paid for prescriptions out-of-pocket or who obtained ADHD medications from someone other than their prescribing physician. Third, although data represent ADHD medications dispensed, verification that women took the medi - cations after the prescription was filled is not available. Finally, this analysis focused on women aged 1544 years and did not identify pregnant women or womens risk for pregnancy. This analysis used a large database to estimate the percent - age of privately insured reproductive-aged women who filled an ADHD medication prescription during 20032015. The increasing trend toward prescribing ADHD medications to reproductive-aged women highlights the importance of research examining ADHD medication safety in this popula - tion, including safety before and during pregnancy. CDCs T reating for T wo: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy initiative (https: //www. cdc. gov/treatingfortwo) helps address this need Summary What is already known about this topic? Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use has increased among U. S. pregnant women, and consensus about its safety during pregnancy is lacking. Given that half of U. S. pregnancies are unintended, ADHD medication use among reproductive-aged women might result in early pregnancy exposure, a critical period for fetal development. What is added by this report? The percentage of privately insured reproductive-aged women who filled a prescription for an ADHD medication increased 344% from 2003 (0. 9%) to 2015 (4. 0%) . ADHD medication prescriptions increased across all age groups and U. S. geographic regions, and the increase was confined to stimulant medications. What are the implications for public health practice? ADHD medication prescriptions are increasingly common among privately insured, reproductive-aged women. Additional research on ADHD medication safety among this population, including safety before and during pregnancy, could help women and their health care providers make evidence-based decisions concerning the risks and benefits of pharmacologic and behavioral treatment options for common conditions, including ADHD. by conducting research on medication safety before and during pregnancy to help women and their health care providers make evidence-based decisions regarding the risks and benefits of pharmacologic and behavioral treatment options for common conditions, including ADHD.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 71 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionRespiratory Syncytial Virus Seasonality  United States, 20142017 Erica Billig Rose, PhD1; Alexandra Wheatley2; Gayle Langley, MD2; Susan Gerber, MD2; Amber Haynes, MPH2 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children worldwide (13) . In the United States, RSV infection results in >57, 000 hos - pitalizations and 2 million outpatient visits each year among children aged <5 years (3) . Recent studies have highlighted the importance of RSV in adults as well as children (4) . CDC reported RSV seasonality nationally, by U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions* and for the state of Florida, using a new statistical method that analyzes poly - merase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory detections reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) (https: //www. cdc. gov/surveillance/nrevss/ index. html) . Nationally, across three RSV seasons, lasting from the week ending July 5, 2014 through July 1, 2017, the median RSV onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October), and lasted 31 weeks until week 18 (early May) . The median national peak occurred at week 5 (early February) . Using these new methods, RSV season circulation patterns differed from those reported from previous seasons (5) . Health care providers and public health officials use RSV circulation data to guide diagnostic testing and to time the administration of RSV immunoprophylaxis for populations at high risk for severe respiratory illness (6) . With several vaccines and other immunoprophlyaxis products in development, estimates of RSV circulation are also important to the design of clinical trials and future vaccine effectiveness studies. Participating clinical and public health laboratories volun - tarily report the number of aggregate and positive RSV tests * Listed by region number and headquarters city. Region 1 (Boston) : Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; Region 2 (New York) : New Jersey and New York; Region 3 (Philadelphia) : Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia; Region 4 (Atlanta) : Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee; Region 5 (Chicago) : Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin; Region 6 (Dallas) : Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; Region 7 (Kansas City) : Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska; Region 8 (Denver) : Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming; Region 9 (San Francisco) : Arizona, California, Hawaii, and Nevada; Region 10 (Seattle) : Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

In previous years, the RSV season was defined by consecutive weeks when RSV antigen-based tests exceeded 10% positivity (5); however, since 2008, laborato - ries have shifted away from antigen-based RSV testing, and since 2014 the majority of tests and RSV detections among consistently reporting laboratories are determined by PCR (7) . From July through the following June of 201415, 201516 and 201617, approximately 56%, 62%, and 72% of RSV detections, respectively, were reported by PCR methods. To account for these observed changes in testing practice and to more accurately reflect recent circulation patterns, only results from PCR detection methods are included in this report. The method that consistently captured the highest percent - age of PCR detections for retrospectively characterizing RSV seasons was determined to be the retrospective slope 10 (RS10) method (7) . This method uses a centered 5-week moving average of RSV detections normalized to a season peak of 1, 000 detections. The season onset was defined as the second of 2 consecutive weeks when the slope, or normalized 5-week moving average of RSV detections between subsequent weeks, exceeded 10. The season offset was the last week when the standardized (normalized) detections exceeded the standard - ized detections at onset. The peak was the week with the most standardized detections. The season duration was the inclusive weeks between onset and offset. Because patterns of weekly RSV circulation in Florida are different from regional and national patterns, Florida data are reported separately from other national data. RSV circulation patterns also appear to differ for Hawaii compared with other states in Region 9 based on limited antigen testing. Therefore, onset, offset, peak, and duration were summarized using the median of the three seasons nationally (with and without Florida and Hawaii), by HHS region, and for Florida. There are an insufficient number of Hawaii laboratories consistently reporting PCR data to present the state data separately with confidence. Laboratories were included in the analysis if they consistently conducted PCR testing, as defined by the following criteria: 1) reported RSV PCR testing results for 30 weeks during the 12-month NREVSS surveillance year and 2) averaged 10 PCR tests per week during the 52 weeks of the NREVSS season.  The 12 months included in a particular reporting season run from July through June. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 72 MMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionFrom the week ending July 5, 2014 through July 1, 2017, there were three distinct RSV seasons: 201415, 201516, and 201617 (Figure) . For each of these seasons, 135, 218, and 244 laboratories, respectively, reported at least 1 week of RSV testing by PCR to NREVSS. This analysis was limited to 80 (59%), 108 (50%), and 118 (48%) qualifying laboratories for 201415, 201516, and 201617, respectively (Table 1) . The seasons as determined by the RS10 method captured 98% of reported RSV PCR detections during the 201415 reporting period and 97% of those reported during the 201516 and 201617 reporting periods. Nationally, across the three seasons, the median RSV onset occurred at surveillance week 41 (mid-October), and lasted 31 weeks until surveillance week 18 (early May) (Table 2) . The median national peak occurred at week 5 (early February) . When Florida and Hawaii are excluded, the national onset occurred 1 week later and the season duration decreased by 1 week. Median onset for the 10 HHS regions (exclud - ing Florida and Hawaii) ranged from week 37 to week 48 (mid-September to early December) and offset ranged from week 15 to week 21 (mid-April to late May) (Figure) . The median season peaks ranged from week 52 to week 7 (late December to mid-February), and the median duration ranged from 22 to 37 weeks (Table 2) . Region 9 had the shortest season (median = 22 weeks), and Region 4 had the longest (37 weeks) . The median onset for Florida occurred at week 37 (mid-September), and the season continued through week 16 (mid-April) (Table 2) . Discussion The national RSV season onsets and offsets reported here occurred in different surveillance weeks than those reported in previous seasons (5) . Using PCR data reported to NREVSS, onsets for the 201415, 201516, and 201617 seasons occurred approximately 2 weeks earlier than did those for the 201213 and 20132014 seasons (early to mid-October versus late October to early November), which were determined using antigen data; similarly, offsets occurred approximately 4 weeks later (late April to early May versus late March) . These differences largely reflect the adoption of a statistical method that identifies a consistent inflection point in weekly RSV detections, rather than a threshold of weekly positivity influenced heavily by the volume of tests performed (7) . The differences inherent in evalu - ating PCR tests, many of which detect several viral respiratory pathogens, compared with RSV antigen tests, that exclusively detect RSV, necessitated the adoption of a new statistical method to capture a consistently high proportion of RSV detections within the defined season (7) . This change in methodology has resulted in a relative lengthening of the RSV seasons. Using antigen-based methods, in past years Florida has been observed to have an earlier onset than other states in the Summary What is already known about this topic? For most of the United States, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season lasts from fall through spring but varies from year to year and by geographic region. What is added by this report? This report uses a new statistical method that analyzes poly - merase chain reaction laboratory detections reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) to determine RSV seasonality nationally and by region for three recent seasons (20142017) . Nationally, lasting from the week ending July 5, 2014 through July 1, 2017, the median RSV onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October), and lasted 31 weeks until week 18 (early May) . The median national peak occurred at week 5 (early February) . Onsets for the 201417 seasons occurred approximately 2 weeks earlier than did those for the 20122014 seasons (early to mid-October versus late October to early November), which were determined using antigen data. What are the implications for public health practice? RSV seasonality data can guide diagnostic testing and inform policy decisions regarding administration of currently available immunoprophylaxis products, when indicated, and the timing of clinical trials and future evaluations of vaccines and immuno - prophylaxis products currently under development. country (8) . However, using the RS10 method, this earlier onset was not consistently observed. This report included fewer consis - tently reporting laboratories in Florida compared with previous seasons, and the observed patterns might not represent the entire state. Previous limited antigen-based testing shows that seasonal - ity in Hawaii might differ from that in other states in Region 9, but too few laboratories have consistently reported PCR data during the analysis period to present these data separately (https: //www. cdc. gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/state. html#HI) . Many factors might influence national, regional, and countylevel RSV activity, including social and demographic factors, population density, pollution, and climate (810) . NREVSS surveillance data reflect recent circulation patterns of RSV and might inform policy decisions regarding adminis - tration of palivizumab for immunoprophylaxis. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for administration during the RSV sea - son to infants at high risk and young children likely to benefit from immunoprophylaxis, based on their gestational age at birth and the presence of certain underlying medical condi - tions during the RSV season (6) . In addition, RSV seasonality data might inform the timing of clinical trials for several RSV vaccines and immunoprophlyaxis products in development, as well as the evaluation of product effectiveness after licensure.  CDC does not make recommendations regarding the administration of RSV immunoprophylaxis.

As testing methods and practices continue to evolve, CDC might further refine the approach to ascertaining RSV seasons. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, reporting to NREVSS is voluntary, and analysis is limited to consistently reporting laboratories, which might not fully represent local and regional circulation. Second, low RSV circulation might not be captured within the NREVSS onset and offset, although at least 97% of detections were accounted for using the RS10 method. Third, this report only includes PCR detections. Although this represents a majority of detections among consistent reporters, 28%44% of detec - tions are by antigen methods. Finally, although the number of positive detections is dependent upon the number of tests ordered, the RS10 method minimizes this bias by normalizing the detections. Despite these limitations, NREVSS provides useful information to clinicians regarding RSV circulation Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 75 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 1.

The RS10 method used here captures a high proportion of RSV PCR detections for retrospectively determining RSV seasonality, but cannot be used to determine seasonal onset and offset in real time, and can only be employed after the season ends. Alternative statistical methods, including the tenfold baseline or 3% threshold methods (7) might be used to determine seasonality in real time or near real time.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 19, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 2 77 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNotes from the Field Legionellosis Outbreak Associated with a Hotel Aquatics Facility  Tennessee, 2017 Jane K. Yackley, MPH1, 2; David Sweat, MPH3; Mary-Margaret A. Fill, MD2; Katie Garman, MPH2; John R. Dunn DVM, PhD2 On June 26, 2017, the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) was notified by CDC of two travel-associated cases of legionellosis. The patients resided in Florida and the United Kingdom but had a common hotel exposure in Memphis, Tennessee. On June 27, the Shelby County Health Department identified a third case in a Shelby County resident with the same hotel exposure. All three persons had positive Legionella urinary antigen tests and reported using the hotel hot tub. A joint state and local investigation was launched, which included environmental health, epidemiologic, and laboratory components. Shelby County environmental health specialists conducted an assessment of the hotel aquatics facility and iden - tified improper water treatment monitoring and low chlorine residuals (0 ppm; acceptable range = 13 ppm) . On June 28, TDH was notified of four additional travel companions with illness after exposure to the hotel aquatics facility, including two persons with confirmed Legionella, one of whom died. A public health directive was issued to the hotel on June 28, closing the aquatics facility and requiring consultation with an environmental engineering firm familiar with CDC Legionella reduction guidance for the assessment, testing, and remedia - tion of the water distribution systems (1) . Aquatics area water sampling was also conducted by a TDH environmental health specialist. Laboratory testing of the aquatics facility water samples identified three Legionella polymerase chain reaction positive samples from the pool, pool sand filter, and hot tub sand filter, and isolated Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 from the hot tub sand filter. The remediation firm isolated two nonpneumophila Legionella species, including an isolate from the aquatics facility sprinkler system. An online survey was created to capture epidemiologic and exposure information among hotel guests. A guest roster (including hotel guests before and after the official opening of the aquatics facility on May 27 [i. e. , from May 15 to June 27]) was requested. On July 6, approximately 4, 000 emails and 209 letters containing the survey link were sent to guests with available contact information. As of July 31, the survey end date, 983 responses were received. Through survey responses, CDC reciprocal notification of non-Tennessee cases, and calls received at the health department, 92 cases were identified, including nine laboratory-confirmed (urinary antigen positive) cases, 19 probable (self-reported pneumonia) cases, and 64 sus - pected (self-reported fever and 1 compatible symptom*) cases. All persons reported hotel stay dates during May 15June 27. Cases represented persons from 29 states, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Median age of the persons was 55 years (range = 1381 years), and 26 (28%) persons reported being a current or former smoker. Sixteen persons were hospitalized, and one aforementioned person died. In a case-control analysis, illness was strongly associated with the aquatics facility (odds ratio = 11. 2 [95% confidence interval = 3. 437. 4]) . The incidence of legionellosis has increased approximately 4. 5-fold in the United States since 2000, and an increasing number of Legionella outbreaks have been reported (2, 3) . Hotels are a commonly reported site of Legionella outbreaks; however, prompt identification of clusters can be challenging because of the transient nature of the exposed population. Approximately 10% of Legionella infections are fatal; therefore, timely investigation of cases is critical (4) . This outbreak highlights the importance of rapid case notification and collaboration among environmental health, epidemiologic, and laboratory disciplines during legionellosis outbreaks. In this outbreak, rapid reporting of domestic and international travel-associated cases to CDC and reciprocal notification facilitated rapid identification of the common hotel exposure and initiation of an outbreak investigation, potentially preventing additional morbidity and mortality. Within 3 days of notification, an environmental assessment was performed, and within 12 days, preliminary epidemiologic analyses and laboratory results were available. The combined environmental health, epidemiologic, and laboratory findings helped identify and implicate the hotel aquatics facility. This outbreak investigation also highlights the need for ongoing health care provider education regarding the impor - tance of obtaining clinical isolates for public health legionellosis investigations. No appropriate clinical specimens were identi - fied or available for culture, which is required for subtyping and comparison with environmental isolates. That 70 (76%) persons reported seeking medical care and 16 (17%) were hospitalized during this outbreak suggests missed opportuni - ties for specimen collection. Provider education around testing methods and the need for clinical isolates during outbreaks could improve future Legionella outbreak investigations. * Compatible symptoms included myalgia, cough, fatigue/malaise/weakness, loss of appetite, headache, abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhea, and vertigo.

Kronman, MD5; Meagan Kay, DVM1 On May 1, 2017, in Washington, Public HealthSeattle & King County (PHSKC) was notified of a possible Baylisascaris procyonis infection in a previously healthy male child aged 19 months. The patient had been evaluated on April 26 for a 1-week history of irritability followed by tremors of his extremi - ties, ataxia, and decreased interactivity. On examination, the patient was afebrile with an inability to sit or stand unaided; complete blood count revealed eosinophilia (absolute eosino - phils = 5, 080; reference range = 0250); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain indicated diffuse, patchy white matter lesions, alongside patchy, enhancing lesions in both cerebellar hemispheres. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care hospital on April 27 for further evaluation and manage - ment; spinal MRI and ophthalmologic exams were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was notable for 4 white blood cells (reference range = 05); however, increased eosinophils were noted on cytologic review. The patients parents reported that the child had ingested soil and animal feces in their backyard several weeks before symptom onset. After consultation with CDC, empirical treat - ment with oral albendazole (25 mg/kg/day) and intravenous steroids for suspected baylisascariasis was initiated on April 29, while B. procyonis antibody test results were pending. The patient exhibited neurologic improvement on May 1 and was discharged on May 2. Serum and CSF specimens collected during hospitalization were positive for B. procyonis specific immunoglobulin anti - bodies at CDC; results of Toxocara and Toxoplasma serologies and a stool ova and parasite exam conducted at private labo - ratories were negative. The assay for B. procyonis antibody, an immunoblot test using the recombinant antigen rBpRAG1, is specific and sensitive but cannot differentiate between current or previous infection or exposure (1) . The patient completed 28 days of albendazole and a steroid taper. At 1-month follow up, the patient had marked reduction in tremors and improve - ments in mental status and ambulation. B. procyonis is a roundworm parasite of the North American raccoon (Procyon lotor), the definitive host. Infection with B. procyonis is a rare cause of morbidity and mortality in humans, with 31 cases documented in North America (2, 3) . Infection occurs when humans ingest infective egg stages shed in raccoon feces or material contaminated with raccoon feces (2) . Clinical signs of baylisascariasis depend on the dose of ingested eggs and their extraintestinal migration path (neural, ocular, or visceral tissue) . Among the 31 documented North American cases of disease, 28 (90%) persons had meningoen - cephalitis or encephalopathy (2, 3) . PHSKC conducted an environmental assessment of the patients property on May 9. Dark, cylindrical feces were collected from elevated truncal forks (approximately 8. 2 ft [2. 5 m] and 13. 1 ft [4 m] in height) and base of the tree at the site where the patient regularly played and was seen ingesting soil and animal feces. The fecal characteristics and location at multiple sites were consistent with a raccoon latrine (i. e. , com - munal defecation site) (4) . A fecal sample was also collected from the patients healthy dog. All fecal samples collected from the tree yielded microscopic eggs consistent in morphology and size to B. procyonis. No parasite ova were detected in the fecal sample collected from the dog. The patients parents had not previously noticed any raccoon latrines on their property. PHSKC recommended restricting access to the tree and surrounding areas until it could be appropriately cleaned and consulting with a veterinarian about implementing regular deworming for their dog, because canines can be a definitive host for B. procyonis and can shed eggs in their feces (3) . This report describes the first laboratory-confirmed B. procyonis human infection in Washington. Children aged <2 years exhibit frequent hand-to-mouth behaviors and might be at increased risk for baylisascariasis through ingestion of soil and other potentially contaminated material (e. g. , contents of sandboxes) (2) . Among the 31 documented disease cases, 17 (55%) were among children aged <2 years (2, 3) . Prevention messages to parents of young children living in areas where raccoons might be present should include avoidance of soil ingestion, handwashing after outdoor play, and providing guidance on identifying and safely cleaning raccoon latrines (4) .
