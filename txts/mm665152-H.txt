U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSexual Intercourse Among High School Students  29 States and United States Overall, 20052015 Kathleen A. Ethier, PhD1; Laura Kann1; Timothy McManus1 Early initiation of sexual activity is associated with having more sexual partners, not using condoms, sexually transmit - ted infection (STI), and pregnancy during adolescence (1, 2) . The majority of adolescents initiate sexual activity during high school, and the proportion of high school students who have ever had sexual intercourse increases by grade; black students are more likely to have ever had sexual intercourse than are white students (3) . The proportion of high school students overall who had ever had sexual intercourse did not change significantly during 19952005 (53. 1% to 46. 8%) (Division of Adolescent and School Health, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, CDC, unpublished data) . To assess whether changes have occurred in recent years in the proportion of high school students who have ever had sexual intercourse, CDC examined trends overall and by grade, race/ethnicity, and sex among U. S. high school students, using data from the 20052015 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBSs) and data from 29 states* that conduct the YRBS and have weighted data. Nationwide, the proportion of high school students who had ever had sexual intercourse decreased significantly overall and among 9th and 10th grade students, non-Hispanic black (black) students in all grades, and Hispanic students in three grades. A similar pattern by grade was observed in nearly half the states (14), where the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse decreased only in 9th grade or only in 9th and 10th grades; nearly all other states saw decreases in some or all grades. The overall decrease in the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse during 20052015 is a positive change in sexual risk among adolescents (i. e. , behaviors that place them at risk * Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. for human immunodeficiency virus, STI, or pregnancy) in the United States, an overall decrease that did not occur during the preceding 10 years. Further, decreases by grade and race/ethnicity represent positive changes among groups of students who have been determined in previous studies to be at higher risk for nega - tive outcomes associated with early sexual initiation, such as greater numbers of partners, condom non-use, teen pregnancy, and STI (13) . More work is needed to understand the reasons for these decreases and to ensure that they continue. The national YRBS is a biennial, school-based survey of U. S. high school students conducted by CDC. For each sur - vey, a three-stage cluster sample design was used to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 912 who Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report1394 MMWR / January 5, 2018 / Vol. 66 / Nos. 51 & 52 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe MMWR series of publications is published by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.

Data were weighted to yield nation - ally representative estimates. Data from 29 state YRBSs conducted by state health and education agencies also were included in this report. In each state survey, a two-stage cluster sample design was used to produce representative samples of public school students in 28 states and in public and private school students in one state. During 2015, sample sizes across state surveys ranged from 1, 313 to 14, 837; overall response rates ranged from 60% to 81%. Data were weighted to yield representative estimates by state. Survey procedures for the national and state surveys were designed to protect students privacy by allowing anonymous and voluntary participation. Local parental permission pro - cedures were followed before survey administration. Students completed the self-administered questionnaire during one class period and recorded their responses directly on a computerscannable booklet or answer sheet. Each questionnaire included the following question to ascertain prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse: Have you ever had sexual intercourse? Response options were yes and no. No definition for sexual intercourse was provided. For the national YRBS, prevalence estimates were computed overall and by grade (9th, 10th, 11th, or 12th), sex (male or female), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [white], black, or Hispanic) . For the state YRBSs, prevalence estimates were computed by grade. Statistical software was used to account for the complex sample designs during analyses. Logistic regression analyses were used to account for all available estimates; control for changes in sex, grade, and race/ ethnicity over time; and assess statistically significant (p<0. 05) long-term linear and quadratic trends in ever having had sexual intercourse during 20052015. A quadratic trend indicates a significant but nonlinear trend in prevalence over time. Both a linear and quadratic trend are possible because the linear trend indicates the direction of the trend from the start to the end of the time frame, and the quadratic trend indicates a nonlinear change within the time frame. For the national YRBS, race/ethnicity data are presented for black, white, and Hispanic students only. Nationwide, during 20052015, a significant linear decrease in the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse among all students in grades 912 (46. 8% to 41. 2%) was identified (Table) (Figure 1) . A significant linear decrease also was identi - fied among male (47. 9% to 43. 2%), female (45. 7% to 39. 2%), black (67. 6% to 48. 5%), and Hispanic (51. 0% to 42. 5%) students. Among black students, a significant quadratic trend also was identified. The prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse among black students did not change between 2005 (67. 6%) and 2009 (65. 2%), but subsequently decreased from 2009 (65. 2%) to 2015 (48. 5%) . During 20052015, among 9th grade students, a significant linear decrease in the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse was identified overall (34. 3% to 24. 1%) and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 5, 2018 / Vol. 66 / Nos. 51 & 52 1395 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE.

Among 9th grade black students, a significant quadratic trend also was identified; prevalence decreased between 2005 (55. 4%) and 2011 (48. 2%) and then decreased even more sharply from 2011 (48. 2%) to 2015 (31. 4%) . Among 10th grade students, a significant linear decrease in prevalence was identified overall (42. 8% to 35. 7%) and among black (66. 4% to 47. 3%) and Hispanic (46. 9% to 36. 0%) students.

In two states (North Dakota and Wyoming), the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse did not decrease over time in any grade. Discussion Nationwide, although the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse decreased overall during 20052015, closer examination of the data indicated several distinctions by sex, grade, and race/ethnicity. First, among students overall, sig - nificant linear decreases were observed among all sex and race/ ethnicity subgroups except white students. Second, decreases were seen among 9th and 10th grade students, but not 11th and 12th grade students. A similar pattern was observed in almost half (14) of the states where the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse decreased only in 9th grade or only in 9th and 10th grades, and only two states experienced no decreases by grade. Finally, nationwide decreases were seen among black students in all grades and Hispanic students in three grades (9th, 10th, and 12th grades), but no statistically significant decreases were observed among white students in any grade. Thus, these data indicate that during 20052015, significant decreases in the percentage of high school students who had sexual intercourse (particularly students in grades 9 and 10 and black students) occurred at the national level and in many states for which data were available. Although these findings cannot be connected directly to any specific intervention, the results indicate that decreases in prevalence of sexual intercourse occurred among the nations high school students. During 20052015, the United States experienced significant shifts in various influences that might have affected FIGURE 2.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita - tions. First, these data apply only to youths who attend school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons in this age group. Nationwide, in 2012, among persons aged 1617 years, approximately 3% were not enrolled in a high school program Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 5, 2018 / Vol. 66 / Nos. 51 & 52 1397 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Early initiation of sexual activity is associated with more sexual partners, not using condoms, teen pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) during adolescence. Most adoles - cents initiate sexual activity during high school. The percentage of students who had ever had sexual intercourse did not change significantly during 19952005 (53. 1% to 46. 8%) . What is added by this report? Analysis of data from national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys indicated that the proportion of high school students nation - wide who had ever had sexual intercourse decreased signifi - cantly during 20052015 overall, among 9th and 10th grade students, among black students across all grades, and among Hispanic students in three grades. A similar pattern by grade was observed in nearly half of the states with available data. What are the implications for public health practice? During 20052015, the overall decrease in the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse is a positive change in the level of sexual risk among adolescents in the United States. The decreases by grade suggest that fewer students are having sexual intercourse during the earlier years of high school. This observation, as well as decreases in the prevalence of sexual intercourse among black and Hispanic students, represent positive changes among groups of students who have been determined in previous studies to be at higher risk for negative outcomes associated with early sexual initiation. Understanding the underlying causes of these decreases in the prevalence of ever having had sexual intercourse can inform strategies to ensure that such decreases continue. and had not completed high school (6) . Second, the extent of underreporting or overreporting of behaviors cannot be determined, although the survey questions demonstrate good test-retest reliability (7) . The decreases in sexual intercourse by grade suggest that fewer students are having sexual intercourse during the earlier years of high school; this finding is especially encouraging. This finding, coupled with decreases in the prevalence of sexual intercourse among black and Hispanic students, represent positive changes among groups of students (e. g. , students who have sex at younger ages and black youths) who have been indicated in previous studies to be at higher risk for negative outcomes associated with early sexual initiation, such as higher numbers of partners, non-use of condoms, teen pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Adolescence is characterized by profound intellectual, emotional, and psychological growth (8), all of which could be influenced by sociocultural and educational changes. More research is necessary to understand the contributing factors and the implications of these findings and to examine the contribution of these declines to declines in teenage childbearing and the potential relationship with STI.

Hootman, PhD1; Louise B. Murphy, PhD1; John D. Omura, MD2; Teresa J. Brady, PhD1; Michael Boring, MS1; Kamil E. Barbour, PhD1; Charles G. Helmick, MD1 Arthritis affects an estimated 54 million U.

The American College of Rheumatologys osteoarthritis management guidelines rec - ommend exercise as a first-line, nonpharmacologic strategy to manage arthritis symptoms (2), and a Healthy People 2020 objective is to increase health care provider counseling for physical activity or exercise among adults with arthritis. * To determine the prevalence and percentage change from 2002 to 2014 in receipt of health care provider counseling for physi - cal activity or exercise (counseling for exercise) among adults with arthritis, CDC analyzed 2002 and 2014 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. From 2002 to 2014, the ageadjusted prevalence of reporting health care provider counsel - ing for exercise among adults with arthritis increased 17. 6%, from 51. 9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49. 9%53. 8%) to 61. 0% (CI = 58. 6%63. 4%) (p<0. 001) . The age-adjusted prevalence of reporting health care provider counseling for exercise among persons with arthritis who described themselves as inactive increased 20. 1%, from 47. 2% (CI = 44. 0%50. 4%) in 2002 to 56. 7% (CI = 52. 3%61. 0%) in 2014 (p = 0. 001) . Prevalence of counseling for exercise has increased significantly since 2002; however, approximately 40% of adults with arthritis are still not receiving counseling for exercise. Improving health care provider training and expertise in exercise counseling and incorporating prompts into electronic medical records are potential strategies to facilitate counseling for exercise that can help adults manage their arthritis and comorbid conditions. NHIS is an ongoing survey of the civilian, noninstitutional - ized U. S. population that gathers data on a variety of health topics. CDC analyzed data from 2002 (adult respondents aged 18 years = 31, 044; response rate = 74. 3%) and 2014 (36, 697 adults; response rate = 58. 9%) . Arthritis was defined as a yes response to the question, Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus or fibromyalgia? Health care provider counseling for exercise was defined as a yes response to the question Has a doctor or other health professional ever suggested physical activity or exercise to help * https: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/ArthritisOsteoporosis-and-Chronic-Back-Conditions/objectives.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nhis/quest_data_related_1997_forward. htm. your arthritis or joint symptoms? Age-adjusted percentages and CIs for health care provider counseling for exercise were calculated overall and by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Physical activity was calculated as minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity using six questions regarding the (typical/usual) frequency, intensity, and duration of aerobic physical activity. The level was categorized as active (150 minutes/week moderate-intensity equivalent activity), insufficiently active (some moderate-intensity equivalent activ - ity but not enough to meet active definition), and inactive (no moderate-intensity equivalent activity that lasted at least 10 minutes) . Age-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) to assess the relationship between counseling for exercise and physical inactivity were calculated using logistic regression. Changes in age-adjusted prevalence of counseling for exercise were examined across the 5 years (2002, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2014) in which both arthritis and counseling for exercise questions were included on the survey. All analyses included adjustment for the multistage complex survey design, including applying sampling weights to make estimates representative of the U. S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Estimates were age-standardized to the 2000 projected U. S. popula - tion using three age groups (1844 years, 4564 years, and 65 years) . Statistically significant differences (p<0. 05) in percentages were determined using t-tests. In 2002 and 2014, the age-adjusted prevalences of health care provider counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis were 51. 9% and 61. 0%, respectively, representing a 17. 6% increase (p<0. 001) (Figure) . In 2014, all subgroups exceeded the Healthy People 2020 age-standardized target of 57. 4% for adults with arthritis, with the exception of non-Hispanic other races (53. 8%), underweight/normal weight persons (50. 0%), current smokers (56. 9%), inactive persons (56. 7%), and persons without a primary care provider (50. 7%) . In 2002 and 2014, age-adjusted prevalences of health care provider counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis who were inactive were 47. 2% and 56. 7%, respectively, representing a 20. 1% increase (p = 0. 001) (Table) . Overall, adults with arthritis and obesity had a higher prevalence of having received counseling for exercise than did those who were underweight/ normal weight (70. 7% versus 50. 0% in 2014), but prevalence  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20. pdf.

In both 2002 and 2014, adults with arthritis who did not receive health care provider counseling for exercise had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of physical inactivity. Compared with the referent group of active persons, the prevalence for 2002 was 41. 4%, compared with 34. 7% (age-adjusted PR = 1. 2; CI = 1. 11. 3), and for 2014 was 36. 8% compared with 30. 5% (age-adjusted PR = 1. 2; CI = 1. 21. 3) . Discussion Among adults with arthritis, the prevalence of reported health care provider counseling for exercise increased from 51. 9% in 2002 to 61. 0% in 2014. However, it should be noted that, in a 2014 report, fewer than one third of primary care physicians said they provide exercise counseling for arthritis during office visits (3) . Although the improvement among all health care providers is encouraging, opportunities exist to further increase counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis. This might be particularly true for some subgroups such as persons who are inactive and who might especially benefit from exercise counseling to help get them started. Efforts to help health care providers identify patients with arthritis who are inactive, including strategies such as those from Exercise is Medicine (EIM), might help facilitate pro - vider counseling for exercise during health care encounters. EIMs goals are to have clinicians evaluate physical activity levels at every patient visit, assess whether patients are meeting physical activity guidelines, and provide exercise counseling  http: //exerciseismedicine. org/. and referral to appropriate therapeutic or community-based physical activity resources. The EIM website has free tools and resources to help providers incorporate these principles to improve chronic disease management in their practices. Other subgroups that have not reached the Healthy People 2020 target, including underweight/normal weight persons, current smokers, and certain racial/ethnic groups, warrant attention by health care providers during office visits. Adults without a primary health care provider also had a lower prevalence of receiving counseling for exercise. Other health care providers might need to be encouraged to provide exercise counseling, and adults without a primary provider might be encouraged to obtain one. Health care providers and adults with arthritis agree that physical activity has important benefits for managing arthri - tis, and federal physical activity guidelines have been found reasonable for adults with arthritis (3, 4) . The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans ** recommend that persons with chronic medical conditions including osteoarthritis, engage in regular physical activity according to their abilities, and highlight that any activity is better than none. Health care providers can serve as valuable sources of exercise advice (4), as suggested by the finding that receiving counseling for exercise was associated with lower physical inactivity. However, health care providers often rate their confidence and abil - ity to promote physical activity as low to medium (57) . In one study, 61% of health care providers surveyed felt unsure about their knowledge and skills or that they did not have the needed knowledge and skills to provide counseling on ** https: //www. health. gov/paguidelines.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / January 5, 2018 / Vol. 66 / Nos. 51 & 52 1401 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? The American College of Rheumatologys osteoarthritis management guidelines recommend exercise as a first-line, nonpharmacologic strategy to manage arthritis symptoms. An estimated 54 million adults in the United States are affected by arthritis. What is added by this report? The prevalence of receiving health care provider counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis increased 17. 6% from 51. 9% in 2002 to 61. 0% in 2014. However, nearly 40% of adults with arthritis still do not receive health care provider counseling for exercise. In addition, subgroups including non-Hispanic persons of other races, underweight/normal weight persons, current smokers, inactive persons, and persons without a primary health care provider, are still below the Healthy People 2020 target of 57. 4%. What are the implications for public health practice? Health care provider education and training in exercise counseling, electronic medical record prompts, and connec - tions to community programs might help increase health care provider counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis. exercise to patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (8) . Incorporating counseling into clinical training curriculum and continuing education programming (e. g. , EIM) might encourage health care providers to provide exercise counseling. Other strategies include incorporating prompts into electronic medical records and training health care providers to provide easily tailored exercise prescriptions. Providers can reduce arthritis-specific barriers to exercise by referring patients who are uncertain about exercising safely to evidence-based, community programs. Several community group and self-directed exercise programs are available for adults with arthritis (e. g. , Enhance Fitness, Walk with Ease, and Active Living Every Day) and can reduce pain and improve function, mobility, and mood. Community based organizations, including the National Parks and Recreation Association and the YMCA*** disseminate these evidencebased physical activity programs throughout the United States. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi - tations. First, NHIS data are self-reported and might be sus - ceptible to recall and social desirability biases. Second, NHIS is only representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population, and therefore, estimates do not include those liv - ing in long-term care facilities, prisons, or military personnel.  https: //www. cdc. gov/arthritis/interventions/physical-activity. html.  https: //www. cdc. gov/arthritis/marketing-support/compendium/docs/pdf/ Compendium-2012. pdf.  http: //www. nrpa. org/our-work/partnerships/initiatives/healthy-aging-in-parks/. *** http: //www. ymca. net/enhancefitness/. Third, low response rates (74. 3% in 2002 and 58. 9% in 2014) might introduce response bias, although the sampling weights at least partially adjust for this potential bias. Finally, the exercise counseling question does not address the quality or frequency of the counseling. Prevalence of health care provider counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis has increased significantly over more than a decade, but the prevalence of counseling remains low for a self-managed behavior (exercise) with proven benefits and few risks (8), especially among those who are inactive. Various strategies such as health care provider education and training in exercise counseling and electronic medical record prompts might increase health care provider counseling for exercise among adults with arthritis.

Deputy, PhD1, 2; Bhanuja Dub, MPH1, 3; Andrea J. Sharma PhD1 Women who enter pregnancy at a weight above or below normal weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 18. 524. 9 (calcu - lated as weight in kg/height in m2), are more likely to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes and to have infants who experience adverse health outcomes. For example, prepregnancy underweight (BMI <18. 5) increases the risk for small-for-gestational-age births, whereas prepregnancy overweight (BMI 25. 029. 9) and obesity (BMI 30. 0) increase risks for cesarean delivery, largefor-gestational-age births, and childhood obesity (1) . Given these outcomes, Healthy People 2020 includes an objective to increase the proportion of women entering pregnancy with a normal weight from 52. 5% in 2007 to 57. 8% by 2020. * Because recent trends in prepregnancy normal weight have not been reported, CDC examined 20112015 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) natality data, which included prepregnancy BMI. In 2015, for 48 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC) combined, the prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight was 45. 0%; prevalence ranged from 37. 7% in Mississippi to 52. 2% in DC. Among 38 jurisdictions with prepregnancy BMI data during 20112015, normal weight prevalence declined from 47. 3% to 45. 1%; declines were observed in all jurisdictions but were statisti - cally significant for 27 jurisdictions after standardizing to the 2011 national maternal age and race/ethnicity distribution. Screening womens BMI during routine clinical care provides opportunities to promote normal weight before entering pregnancy. NVSS collects demographic and health information for live births in 50 states and DC via the U. S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth (birth certificate), which was revised in 2003 to include maternal height and prepregnancy weight. Height and prepregnancy weight are self-reported or abstracted from medical records and are used by NVSS to calculate prepregnancy BMI. * Healthy People 2020 Maternal, Infant and Child Health (MICH) Objective 16. 5 for healthy prepregnancy weight (defined as normal weight BMI) was developed using state-specific surveillance data that rely on self-reported height and prepregnancy weight reported approximately 27 months postpartum. Data from 28 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System and data from Californias Maternal and Infant Health Assessment survey contributed to the development of this objective. https: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/ topics-objectives/topic/Maternal-Infant-and-Child-Health/objectives.  Natality data from New York City are reported separately from those for the state of New York and are not included in New York estimates.  Per National Center for Health Statistics guidance for completing the 2003 revision of the U. S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth, the preferred source for prepregnancy weight and height is self-report by the mother around the time of delivery, which is recorded on the Mothers Worksheet (https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/dvs/momswkstf_improv. pdf) . Maternal height and prepregnancy weight recorded in the mothers prenatal care record may be used as an alternative source. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/dvs/birth_edit_specifications. pdf. The revised birth certificate was used in 36 states, DC, and NYC by 2011 and was used in 48 states, DC, and NYC by 2015 (representing 83% and 97% of all live births in 2011 and 2015, respectively) . Births to U. S. resident mothers in states adopting the revised birth certificate by January 1 of each year were eligible for analyses (17, 906, 182 mothers, representing 90% of all U. S. births during 20112015) . ** From these records, those with missing BMI (732, 052) were excluded, resulting in 17, 174, 130 records for analysis (96% of births eligible for this analysis) . Prepregnancy BMI was categorized as underweight (<18. 5), normal weight (18. 524. 9), overweight (25. 029. 9), or obese (30. 0); for some analyses, obesity was categorized as class I (BMI = 30. 034. 9), class II (35. 039. 9), or class III (40. 0) . Overall and jurisdiction-specific prevalences for each prepregnancy BMI category were estimated. Overall and jurisdiction-specific trends were estimated as the percentagepoint difference in prepregnancy normal weight prevalence from 2011 to 2015 for 38 jurisdictions with available data; overall trends for each prepregnancy BMI category were also estimated as the percentage change from 2011 to 2015. Because prepregnancy BMI increases with maternal age and varies by maternal race/ethnicity (2), jurisdiction-specific differences were estimated after directly standardizing each year to the race/ethnicity and age distribution of 2011 U. S. resident mothers to facilitate comparisons. Standardized, jurisdictionspecific differences were evaluated using the z-statistic; p<0. 05 was considered statistically significant. For 48 states, DC, and NYC in 2015, the overall prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight was 45. 0%; prevalences ranged from 37. 7% in Mississippi to 52. 2% in DC (Table 1) . Among 38 jurisdictions with prepregnancy BMI data from 2011 to 2015, prevalence of normal weight declined from 47. 3% to 45. 1%; after standardization, this represented a 1. 9 percentagepoint decline (p<0. 05) . Declines in prepregnancy normal  Connecticut and New Jersey did not use the revised birth certificate by January 1, 2015. ** For each year from 2011 to 2015, the distributions of maternal race/ethnicity and age were not meaningfully different for women residing in states that used the revised birth certificate compared with the entire population of women giving birth in the United States. Additional information can be found in the Birth Data File Users Guide for each year. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/ data_access/Vitalstatsonline. htm.  Race/ethnicity was classified as Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander. Age was categorized into the following age groups: <19, 2024, 2529, 3034, and >35 years.

Corresponding with the decline in prepregnancy normal weight prevalence during 20112015, the entire BMI distribu - tion shifted toward a higher BMI (Figure) . Specifically, there was an 8% decrease in the prepregnancy underweight preva - lence, while there were 2% and 8% increases in overweight and obesity, respectively. Notably, class III obesity prevalence increased more rapidly than did class I or class II obesity (increase of 14% [class III], compared with 10% [class II] and 6% [class I]) . In 2015, jurisdictions with the highest prepregnancy normal weight prevalence (DC, Massachusetts, NYC, and Utah) had the lowest obesity prevalence, whereas jurisdictions with low - est prepregnancy normal weight prevalence (Mississippi and West Virginia) had the highest obesity prevalence (Table 2) . Although NYC had a relatively high prevalence of prepreg - nancy normal weight, it also had the highest prevalence of underweight. Notably, some states exhibited a double burden of higher prevalences of prepregnancy underweight and obesity (Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia) . Discussion Among the 48 states, DC, and NYC that implemented the revised birth certificate, the overall prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight in 2015 was 45. 0%. Among 38 jurisdictions with prepregnancy BMI data from 2011 to 2015, the preva - lence of prepregnancy normal weight declined by 5%, whereas the prevalence of overweight increased by 2%, and the preva - lence of obesity (all classes) increased by 8%; taken together, these results suggest movement away from the Healthy People 2020 target for prepregnancy normal weight. T rends from this analysis extend previous findings and demonstrate continued declines in prepregnancy normal weight prevalence. Data from 20 states participating in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a multistate representative surveillance system, found prevalence of prepreg - nancy normal weight declined from 54. 5% in 2003 to 51. 5% in 2009 (3) .

The declining prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight is concerning because of adverse outcomes associated with entering pregnancy outside of normal weight. For example, prepregnancy underweight increases risks for preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age births, whereas prepregnancy overweight and obesity increase risks for gestational diabetes mellitus and childhood obesity (1) . Moreover, obesity during Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1406 MMWR / January 5, 2018 / Vol. 66 / Nos. 51 & 52 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Entering pregnancy outside a normal weight (body mass index [BMI] of 18. 524. 9 kg/m2) is associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes; given these outcomes, Healthy People 2020 includes an objective to increase the proportion of women entering pregnancy with normal weight. Recent trends in national or jurisdiction-specific prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight have not been reported. What is added by this report? Using data from the revised birth certificate for 48 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC), this analysis found that the overall prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight was 45. 0% in 2015; prevalence ranged from 37. 7% in Mississippi to 52. 2% in DC. Among 36 states, DC, and NYC with available prepregnancy BMI data from 2011 to 2015, prevalence of normal weight declined from 47. 3% to 45. 1%; declines were observed in all jurisdictions but were statistically significant among 27 after standardizing to the 2011 national maternal age and race/ethnicity distribution. What are the implications for public health practice? Overall and among most jurisdictions examined, the prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight is decreasing; this suggests movement away from the Healthy People 2020 objective for prepregnancy normal weight. For women of reproductive age, BMI screening during routine clinical visits provides opportuni - ties to address underweight or obesity, promote normal weight upon entering pregnancy, and ultimately help optimize maternal and child health outcomes. pregnancy has been associated with increased health care service utilization, including longer hospital stays during delivery (5) . Before pregnancy, obesity among women of reproductive age is associated with reduced fertility and potentially increased use of fertility treatments (6) . Preconception care is the provision of medical care and interventions that promote optimal health for reproductiveage women and also promote optimal pregnancy outcomes should a pregnancy occur (7) . Weight-related screening, counseling, and referral for treatment services are some of the components of preconception care (7, 8) . The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians assess BMI to screen all adults for obesity and offer patients with obesity intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions or refer patients for these interventions. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends BMI screening during routine well-woman visits and recently released an online toolkit to facilitate BMI screening and  https: //www. uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/ RecommendationStatementFinal/obesity-in-adults-screening-and-management.  https: //www. acog. org/wellwoman.  https: //www. acog. org/About-ACOG/ACOG-Departments/Toolkits-forHealth-Care-Providers/Obesity-Toolkit. referral for treatment. The toolkit includes an obesity assess - ment algorithm, counseling methods, treatment options, refer - ral resources, and a coding guide to facilitate reimbursement. For women with underweight BMI, ACOG recommends that clinicians counsel patients about adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with underweight and assess for disordered eating habits (8) . Reports indicate prevalence of prepregnancy under - weight is highest among women aged <20 years (2), possibly because adult BMI criteria are applied to pregnancies among adults and adolescents (9); this categorizes more adolescents as underweight than the pediatric growth charts and results in higher recommended pregnancy weight gain, which has been found to improve pregnancy outcomes among adolescents (9) . The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi - tations. First, height and prepregnancy weight on the birth certificate are self-reported or abstracted from medical records, which might result in misclassification of BMI category. Second, results of this analysis are not directly comparable to Healthy People 2020 targets for prepregnancy normal weight because these targets were developed using surveillance data from 29 states that exclusively rely on height and prepregnancy weight self-reported 27 months postpartum; thus, these tar - gets might differ from those developed using birth certificate data. Notably, the revised birth certificate is a census of all births, which will allow for ongoing monitoring of prepreg - nancy weight in all states. Finally, data were not available from all states for trend analyses; thus, results do not represent the entire U. S. population of women giving birth. In 2015, the nearly national prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight was 45. 0% and prevalence declined from 2011 to 2015 in most jurisdictions, suggesting movement away from the Healthy People 2020 objective to increase the prevalence of prepregnancy normal weight. For all women of reproduc - tive age, BMI screening during routine clinical visits provides opportunities to address underweight or obesity, promote normal weight upon entering pregnancy, and ultimately help optimize maternal and child health outcomes.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1408 MMWR / January 5, 2018 / Vol. 66 / Nos. 51 & 52 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNotes from the Field Lead Contamination of Opium  Iran, 2016 Nasim Zamani, MD1, 2; Hossein Hassanian-Moghaddam, MD1, 2 On February 14, 2016, a patient with known addiction to oral opium and no occupational or other lead exposure was admitted to Loghman-Hakim Hospital and Poison Center (LHHPC) in Tehran, Iran, with abdominal pain, anemia, constipation, and a blood lead level (BLL) of 137 g/dL (normal = <10 g/dL) . Over the next 8 months, approximately 3, 000 oral opium users were evaluated at LHHPC, and found to have elevated BLLs (range = 471, 124 g/dL) . During FebruaryNovember 2016, 14 drug couriers who acknowl - edged transporting illicit substances across international borders in their gastrointestinal tracts (1) (body packers) were evaluated at LHHPC to determine the lead content of the drugs they were carrying. Abdominopelvic computerized tomography scans were performed on all 14 persons. Four scans demonstrated varying amounts of amorphous radiodense mate - rial suggestive of lead; these were the only packs that contained opium. Packs carried by the other 10 couriers contained heroin (two persons), methamphetamine (five), and both heroin and methamphetamine (three) . During the evaluation, the couri - ers were awake, with normal vital signs and physical findings; their BLLs ranged from 2 to 17 g/dL. They reported having ingested 130, 300, 700, and 1000 g of opium (550 packs each) in 20-g to 250-g packs. The packs were expelled intact; a pooled sample of the contents was sent to the chemistry laboratory of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, where the lead content was found to be 3, 553 ppm (equivalent to 3. 55 mg/g) by atomic absorption. The study was approved by the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board. According to the World Health Organization, tolerable weekly intake of lead is 25 g/kg body weight (2) (approxi - mately 0. 0018 g per week for a 70-kg [154-lb] adult) . The amount of opium consumed by opium users varies widely; published estimates range from 0. 6 g/day (3) to >100 g/day (4) . A recent U. S. study of a cluster of heavy metal poisoning among Ayurvedic medication users found BLLs >10 g/dL in 40% of 115 persons tested and >25 g/dL in 30% (5); the calculated average amount of lead consumed by persons with BLLs >10 g/dL was 0. 03 g/day. If, as in this analysis, contaminated opium contains 3. 55 mg lead per gram, a user consuming 10 g of opium per day could be ingesting approximately 0. 036 g of lead per day, approximately 20% more than that consumed by the Ayurvedic medicine users who experienced lead toxicity. The rate of absorption of lead from the gastrointestinal tract is variable*; however, the high levels of lead that might be ingested through opium use have the potential to cause substantial lead toxicity, as is currently being reported in Iran (4) . Opium is an important cause of lead poisoning in countries with a high prevalence of opium addiction (4, 6), and leadcontaminated opium has previously been reported in Iran (4) . However, the concentrations of lead in samples obtained by police in 2006 were substantially lower than that found in this analysis (4) . The reason for high levels of lead in opium seized in Iran has not been determined; however, it is suspected to result from either deliberate adulteration by distributors to make the drug heavier so they can realize more profit or an unintentional addition during the preparation process (4) . Iran is one of the main pathways for opium trafficking from Afghanistan to the rest of the world. Although opium production in Afghanistan declined by 48% in 2015 (7), Afghanistan still accounted for two thirds of the global fields of illicit opium poppy produc - tion, and it has been estimated that the 2015 decline will not affect global heroin markets. Although most opiate trafficking to the United States is through South America and Mexico (7), some Afghanistan-produced product is supplied to U. S. markets through African countries. It is not known whether lead is added to other products reportedly transported by drug couriers, including cocaine, heroin, marijuana, hashish, amphetamines, and 3, 4-methyl - enedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) . Clinicians should be aware that persons using opium products that appear to have been smuggled through Iran could be at risk for lead poisoning.

Yaffee, MD1, 3; Mark K. Weng, MD1, 4; D. Cal Ham, MD4; Kimberly Daniels3; Amanda B. Wilburn, MPH3; Kimberly A. Porter, PhD3, 5; Andrea H. Flinchum, MPH3; Sandra Boyd4; Alicia Shams, MPH4; Maroya S. Walters, PhD4; Alexander Kallen, MD4 Carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CP-CRE) express plasmid-encoded car - bapenemases, enzymes that inactivate carbapenem antibiotics. They have the potential for epidemic spread through personto-person transmission and horizontal transfer of resistance mechanisms (1, 2) . Typically, CP-CRE are associated with health care exposure. Clinical CRE infections can have mortality rates as high as 50% (3); however, the majority of CRE patients are asymptomatic. These asymptomatic colonized patients can serve as a source for transmission to other patients (4) . On August 11, 2016, two Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapen - emase (KPC) producing CP-CRE isolates from clinical cultures were reported from patients hospitalized at a rural, community hospital in Kentucky; CRE had not been identified previously at this facility. During the next 4 months, an additional 21 CRE isolates were identified from facility patients, resulting in a total of 23 isolates, including 17 K. pneumoniae, five Escherichia coli, and one Enterobacter cloacae isolate. Seventeen (74%) of these isolates were identified through patient screening cultures; the rest were from clinical cultures. T wo carbapenemase types were identified through testing of 14 available isolates; 13 produced KPC and one produced New Delhi metallo- -lactamase. All CP-CRE were K. pneumoniae with the exception of two KPC-producing E. coli. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of these isolates identified three indistinguishable pairs, one of which was the KPC-producing E. coli isolates. Medical chart review and patient interviews indicated that the patients from whom each pair had been iso - lated had exposure to the emergency department or to the same medical-surgical ward, suggesting transmission on these units. Common health care exposures outside the hospital were not identified among the three pairs. Five of 13 interviewed patients reported receipt of health care outside the local area; three might have introduced CP-CRE into the facility, including one patient who was not screened at admission and two who had CRE identi - fied from admission screening. Targeted environmental cultures identified CP-CRE on an emergency department environmental services cart and from the floor sink drain of the involved medicalsurgical wards environmental services closet. This investigation suggested CP-CRE in this Kentucky facility was likely attributable to both importation into and transmis - sion within the facility and highlights two points relevant to CP-CRE control. First, demonstration of environmental services cart contamination is notable and suggests a possible role for cleaning equipment in CP-CRE spread. This equipment can move between patient rooms and might not be cleaned regularly. Further investigation is needed to better understand the role of this equipment in transmission of resistant organisms in health care facilities. Second, although CP-CRE has been primarily identified from urban areas, these multidrug-resistant organisms can be introduced into rural areas by patients with exposure to health care in higher CP-CREprevalence areas, resulting in local transmission. Facilities in lower CP-CREprevalence areas that treat patients who also access care in higher prevalence areas should be aware of this risk. Recommendations to this facility included initiation of CRE surveillance for patients at high risk (e. g. , patients with health care exposures during the past year in areas with known higher CP-CRE prevalence); reinforcement of daily and terminal cleaning practices by the environmental services team, including daily cleaning of environmental services carts; and working with facilities in its patient-sharing network to implement a regional CP-CRE prevention strategy (5, 6) .

Prevent Infections for Babys Protection is the theme of January 2018s National Birth Defects Prevention Month. Birth defects are common, costly, and critical condi - tions that affect one in 33 U. S. babies annually (1) . Not all birth defects can be prevented, but women can increase their chances of having a healthy baby by reducing their risk for getting infections before and during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or might become pregnant can take the following steps to prevent infections: talk to their health care provider about how they can reduce their risk for infections; get vaccinated to help protect against influenza (2) and pertussis (3); protect themselves from insects, such as mosquitoes, known to carry infections, including Zika (4); and reduce contact with saliva and urine from babies and young children to prevent infections such as cytomegalovirus (5) . CDC encourages everyone to join this nationwide effort to raise awareness of birth defects, their causes, and their impact. Additional information is available at https: //www. cdc. gov/ ncbddd/birthdefects/prevention-month. html. January 713, 2018 is National Folic Acid Awareness Week. CDC urges all reproductive-aged women to get 400 g of folic acid every day to help reduce the risk for serious birth defects of the brain and spinal cord (spina bifida and other neural tube defects) (6) . Women can get folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or both. This guidance is especially important for Hispanic/Latina women, because this group has the high - est rate of pregnancies affected by neural tube defects and the lowest reported consumption of folic acid (7) .
