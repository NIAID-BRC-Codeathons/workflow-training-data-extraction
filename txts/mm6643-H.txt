Approximately 114 million U. S. persons are living with diabetes (30 mil - lion) or prediabetes (84 million) (1) . Persons with prediabe - tes are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (1) . Type 2 diabetes can be prevented through lifestyle changes (e. g. , weight loss, healthy eating, and increased physical activity) (1, 2) . Persons with diabetes can take steps to control the disease and prevent compli - cations (1, 3) . This issue of MMWR includes a report on diabetes-related kidney failure. Working with partners, CDC plays an important role in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes, preventing complications of diabetes, and improving health and quality of life for persons with diabetes. The National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017 (1) provides the latest statistics about diabetes. With the Ad Council, the American Diabetes Association, and the American Medical Association, CDC has developed public service announce - ments to encourage persons to take the prediabetes risk test (https: //DoIHavePrediabetes. org) . CDC also joined forces with CBS Television Stations in a television and digital miniseries, Your Health with Joan Lunden and CDC, to provide information about diabetes prevention and control (https: //www. cdc. gov/diabetestv/index. html) .

Although the number of persons initiating ESRD-D treatment each year has increased since 1980 (1, 2), the ESRD-D incidence rate among persons with diagnosed diabetes has declined since the mid-1990s (2, 3) . To determine whether ESRD-D incidence has continued to decline in the United States overall and in each state, the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, CDC analyzed 20002014 data from the U. S. Renal Data System and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. During that period, the age-standardized ESRD-D incidence among persons with diagnosed diabetes declined from 260. 2 to 173. 9 per 100, 000 diabetic popula - tion (33%), and declined significantly in most states, DC, and Puerto Rico. No state experienced an increase in ESRD-D incidence rates. Continued awareness of risk factors for kidney failure and interventions to improve diabetes care might sustain and improve these trends. The U. S. Renal Data System collects, analyzes, and distrib - utes ESRD clinical and claims data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) (1) . In addition to demographic information, the U. S. Renal Data System includes the date patients were first treated and the primary cause of ESRD from the CMS Medical Evidence Report that health care providers are required by law to complete for each new patient with ESRD (1) . For this analysis, the number of persons aged 18 years initiating ESRD treatment (i. e. , dialysis or transplan - tation) who had diabetes listed as the primary cause of ESRD in each state, DC, and Puerto Rico during 20002014 were obtained from the U. S. Renal Data System. Throughout the period, 44%45% of the new ESRD cases were ESRD-D (1) . The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducts state-based, random-digitdialed telephone surveys in the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico and other U. S. territo - ries. BRFSS respondents were classified as having diagnosed diabetes if they answered yes to the question, Has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes? Women who were told that they had diabetes only during pregnancy were classified as not having diabetes. BRFSS data were weighted to estimate the number of noninstitutionalized persons aged 18 years with diagnosed diabetes in each state, DC, and Puerto Rico. In 2011, BRFSS changed sampling and weighting methodology and added cell phone respondents; however, these changes did not appear to affect overall estimates of self-reported diabetes (4) . In 2014, the median BRFSS response rate for all states and territories was 40. 5% (cell phone) and 48. 7% (landline) . * ESRD-D incidence was calculated by dividing the number of persons initiating ESRD-D treatment by the estimated num - ber of persons with diagnosed diabetes in each state, DC, and Puerto Rico. Data were analyzed using statistical software to estimate standard errors and calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and were age-standardized by the direct method based on the 2000 U. S. standard population. Joinpoint regression was used for trend analyses (5) . Joinpoint regression uses permuta - tion tests to determine whether the rate of change for each trend * https: //www. cdc. gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/2014_dqr. pdf.

In the final model, each trend seg - ment is described by an annual percentage change and the trend for the entire study period is described by the average annual percentage change (AAPC), both with 95% CIs. Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming were excluded from the trend analysis because of the small annual number (<50) of new ESRD-D cases identified during the study period. During 20002014, the total number of adults aged 18 years in the United States, DC, and Puerto Rico who began ESRD-D treatment each year increased from 42, 236 (state range = 325, 117) to 53, 382 (state range = 477, 228) (AAPC = 1. 5% per year [95% CI = 1. 2%1. 8%], p<0. 001) (Figure 1) . From 2000 to 2014, among 47 states, DC, and Puerto Rico, the age-standardized ESRD-D incidence decreased 33% (AAPC = 2. 8% per year [95% CI = -3. 3% to -2. 3%], p<0. 001), from 260. 2 (state range = 171. 2569. 6) to 173. 9 (state range = 81. 7363. 6) per 100, 000 persons with diabetes (Table) (Figure 1) . During 20002014, rates declined significantly in most states, DC, and Puerto Rico (Table) (Figure 2) . In Kansas and Utah, rates declined and then leveled off. From 2000 to 2014, rates did not decline significantly in California, Hawaii, Mississippi, or Montana (Table) . In 2000, the rate was 217. 5 per 100, 000 persons with diabetes in 41 states, DC, and Puerto Rico, and the rate was not <164. 5 in any state; in 2014, the rate was 217. 5 in five states and DC, and was <164. 5 in 24 states (Table) (Figure 2) . Discussion ESRD is a costly and disabling condition that often results in premature death (1) . During 20002014, the overall age-standardized incidence of ESRD-D among adults with diagnosed diabetes decreased by 33%. Rates declined significantly in most states, DC, and Puerto Rico. In 2014, the highest rates were in DC and Hawaii. Continued awareness and interven - tions to reduce the prevalence of risk factors for kidney failure, improve diabetes care, and reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes might sustain these positive trends. The 33% decline in ESRD-D incidence from 2000 to 2014 reported here is similar to the 28% decline reported using 20002010 nationally representative surveillance data (3) . Reasons for the decline in ESRD-D incidence cannot be determined from surveillance data. However, reasons for the decline might include reductions in risk factors for kidney failure (e. g. , hyperglycemia and hypertension) in the diabetic population or better treatment of kidney disease, includ - ing the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, which slow the decline in kidney function in addition to lowering blood pressure, thus delaying the onset of ESRD-D (6) . Although ESRD-D incidence rates are declining, the number of patients with newly diagnosed ESRD-D is likely to increase as the number of persons with diabetes increases (2) . Furthermore, one in three adults with diabetes is estimated to have chronic kidney disease (i. e. , kidney damage or reduced kidney function); however, most persons with chronic kidney disease are unaware that they have it (7) . Early detection and better management of chronic kidney disease in persons with diabetes can slow its progression to ESRD, prevent complica - tions, and improve cardiovascular outcomes (7) . Testing for urine albumin, which is an early marker of kidney disease, is recommended for all patients with diabetes, and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensinreceptor blockers is indicated for persons with diabetes and hypertension (8) . Effective interventions to improve blood glucose levels and blood pressure control might prevent or delay the onset of kidney disease (7) in adults with diabetes. To support primary prevention, effective community-based approaches to prevent obesity and increase physical activity, along with type 2 diabetes prevention programs targeted to populations at high risk, might reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes, and consequently, diabetic kidney disease (9) . The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, data on ESRD treatment were based on reports to CMS; patients whose treatment was not reported to CMS (e. g. , persons who refused treatment or who died from ESRD before receiving treatment) were not included and might result in an underestimation of incidence. Second, revised diagnostic criteria for diabetes in 1997 might have led to the detection of more persons with diabetes earlier in the disease process (persons who have not had diabetes long enough to develop ESRD-D) (8) and might result in an underestimation of inci-dence. Third, the estimated population with diagnosed diabetes was based on self-reports. Although self-report of diabetes is highly accurate (persons with diagnosed diabetes are likely to report having diabetes) (10), the total number of adults with diabetes is underestimated, which thus results in an overestima - tion of ESRD-D incidence. Finally, BRFSS survey methods changed in 2011 potentially confounding interpretation of trends. However, using different surveillance data to estimate the U. S. diabetic population yielded a similar overall decline in ESRD-D incidence rates (3) . CDC works with public and private partners to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes and to improve outcomes for persons with diabetes. In 2013, CDC assisted state health departments in implementing diabetes self-management edu - cation and training programs and strategies to increase use of diabetes self-management education and training by persons Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1168 MMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1170 MMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? The incidence of end-stage renal disease attributed to diabetes (ESRD-D) in the U. S. population with diagnosed diabetes began to decline in the mid-1990s. What is added by this report? During 20002014, the age-standardized incidence of ESRD-D has continued to decline significantly in the United States and in most states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. No state experienced an increase in rates. What are the implications for public health practice? Continued awareness of diabetes and interventions to reduce the prevalence of risk factors for kidney failure, improve diabetes care, and prevent type 2 diabetes might sustain the decline in ESRD-D incidence rates in the population with diagnosed diabetes. with diabetes. Diabetes self-management education and training is an important component of integrated diabetes care, teaching patients about diabetes and strategies they can use to manage their disease. CDCs National Diabetes Prevention Program (https: //www. cdc. gov/diabetes/prevention) supports the nationwide implementation of evidence-based, structured lifestyle programs to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes among persons with prediabetes (persons who have blood glucose levels that are elevated, but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes) . CDCs U. S. Diabetes Surveillance System (https: //www. cdc. gov/diabetes/data) monitors diabetes and its risk factors and complications, including ESRD-D, to assess progress in diabetes prevention and control (2) . CDCs Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System (https: //www. cdc. gov/ckd/surveillance) monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (i. e. , before ESRD) and its risk factors in the U. S. population and tracks progress in chronic kidney disease prevention, management, and control.

Hill, MD, PhD1; Laurie D. Elam-Evans, PhD1; David Yankey, MS, MPH1; James A. Singleton, PhD1; Yoonjae Kang, MPH1 Vaccination is the most effective intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable dis - eases in young children (1) . Data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) were used to assess coverage with recommended vaccines (2) among children aged 1935 months in the United States. Coverage remained 90% for 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (91. 9%), 1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91. 1%), 1 dose of varicella vaccine (90. 6%), and 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) (90. 5%) . Coverage in 2016 was approximately 12 percentage points lower than in 2015 for 3 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, the primary Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) series, 3 HepB doses, and 3 and 4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), with no changes for other vaccines. More direct evaluation of trends by month and year of birth (3) found no change in coverage by age 2 years among children included in combined data from the 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (born January 2012 through January 2015) . The observed decreases in annual estimates might result from random differences in vaccination coverage by age 19 months between children sampled in 2016 and those sampled in 2015, among those birth cohorts eligible to be sampled in both survey years. For most vaccines, 2016 coverage was lower among non-Hispanic black* (black) children than among non-Hispanic white (white) children, and for children living below the federal poverty level  compared with those living at or above the poverty level. Vaccination coverage was generally lower among children insured by Medicaid (2. 512. 0 percentage points), and was much lower among uninsured children (12. 424. 9 percentage points), than among children with private insurance. The Vaccines for Children  (VFC) program was designed to increase access to vaccines among children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of * Child s race/ethnicity was reported by his/her parent or guardian. Children categorized in this report as white, black, American Indian/Alaska native, Asian, native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, or multiple races were identified as non-Hispanic by the parent or guardian. Children identified as being of multiple races had more than one race category designated. Children identified as Hispanic might be of any race.  P overty level uses income and family size to categorize households into those 1) at or above the poverty level, and 2) below the poverty level. Poverty level was based on 2015 U. S. Census poverty thresholds (https: //www. census. gov/data/tables/ time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds. html) .  https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index. html. inability to pay. Greater awareness and facilitating use of VFC might be helpful in reducing these disparities. Efforts should also be focused on minimizing breaks in continuity of health insurance and eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during visits to health care providers. Despite the observed disparities and small changes in coverage from 2015, vaccination coverage among children aged 1935 months remained high and stable in 2016. The NIS-Child uses a random-digitdialing sample of landline and cellular telephone numbers to contact parents or guardians of children aged 1935 months in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and U. S. territories.  Parents/guardians are interviewed by telephone to collect sociodemographic and health insurance information for ageeligible children in the household. With consent of parent or guardian, a survey is mailed to all identified vaccination providers to collect dates and types of all vaccines administered to the child. Vaccination coverage estimates use only provider-reported vaccination data. NIS-Child methodology, including weighting procedures, has been described previously. ** The household interview response rate  was 33. 9% from the combined landline/cell phone sample. Among households with completed interviews, 54. 6% had adequate vaccination data from providers, yielding 14, 988 children available for determination of national coverage estimates for 2016. Logistic  Estimates for states, selected local ar eas, and territories are available online at https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/datareports/index. html. The local areas sampled separately for the 2016 NIS-Child included areas that receive federal Section 317 immunization funds and are included in the NIS-Child sample every year (Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas) and two additional sample areas (El Paso County, Texas and Dallas County, Texas) . The 2016 NIS-Child was also conducted in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. This report includes national estimates, excluding the territories. * * F urther details regarding the statistical methodology of NIS-Child are available in the NIS-Child Data Users Guide 2015, which is available at https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/imz-managers/nis/datasets. html.  The Council of American S urvey Research Organizations (CASRO) household response rate is calculated as the product of the resolution rate (percentage of the total telephone numbers called that were classified as nonworking, nonresidential, or residential), screening completion rate (percentage of known households that were successfully screened for the presence of age-eligible children), and the interview completion rate (percentage of households with one or more age-eligible children that completed the household survey) . The CASRO household response rate is equivalent to the American Association for Public Opinion Research type 3 response rate http: //www. aapor. org/AAPOR_ Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal. pdf.  Childr en with receipt of at least one vaccination reported by a provider and those who received no vaccinations were considered to have adequate provider data. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1172 MMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionregression was used to assess the association of race/ethnicity with vaccination coverage, adjusting for poverty status. T-tests on weighted data were used to evaluate differences in coverage estimates by demographic characteristics; differences were considered to be statistically significant for p-values <0. 05. T rends in vaccination coverage by ages 19, 24, and 35 months were evaluated by month and year of birth using weighted linear regression (3) . Linear trends were estimated using combined data from 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (births from January 2012 through January 2015), and an expanded analysis of the 20122016 data (births from January 2009 through January 2015) . Results by age 24 months (2 years) most closely approximate the average age at vaccination assessment in the annual NIS-Child sample (28 months) . 2016 Vaccination Coverage Coverage remained 90% for 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (91. 9%), 1 dose MMR (91. 1%), 1 dose of varicella vaccine (90. 6%), and 3 doses of HepB (90. 5%) (Table 1) . Coverage was lowest for 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) (60. 6%), the combined 7-vaccine series (70. 7%),  the HepB birth dose (71. 1%), and a completed series of rotavirus vaccine (74. 1%) . Only 0. 8% of children received no vaccinations. Vaccination Coverage by Race/Ethnicity, Poverty Status, and Type of Health Insurance Compared with white children, black children had lower coverage with 3 and 4 doses of DTaP, the primary and full series of Hib, 3 and 4 doses of PCV, 2 doses of HepA, the completed rotavirus vaccine series, and the 7-vaccine series (Table 2) . For 3 doses of DTaP, the primary series of Hib, and 3 doses of PCV, these disparities were not statistically significant after adjustment for poverty status; however, for the remaining vaccines, racial/ethnic disparities persisted only among children living at or above poverty (data not shown) . For example, coverage with 4 doses of DTaP was similar for white and black children below poverty (75. 6% and 76. 6%, respectively); among children living at or above poverty, coverage rates among white and black children were 86. 8% and 77. 2%, respectively. Among children at or above poverty, a higher proportion of black children than white children (25. 8% of black children compared with 10. 4% of white children) were living just above the poverty level (up to 138% of poverty) . The proportion of white children living in households with an income to poverty ratio of 4 was twice that  The combined 7-v accine series (4: 3: 1: 3*: 3: 1: 4) includes 4 doses of DTaP; 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; 3 or 4 doses of Hib (depending upon product type of vaccine); 3 doses of HepB; 1 dose of varicella vaccine; and 4 doses of PCV. of black children (41. 5% and 20. 4%, respectively) . Rotavirus vaccination coverage was lower among Hispanic (73. 0%) than among white (77. 3%) children. For most vaccines, coverage among children living below the federal poverty level was lower than coverage among those living at or above the federal poverty level (Table 2) . The larg - est gaps were for rotavirus vaccine (12. 7 percentage points), 4 PCV doses (7. 4 percentage points), the 7-vaccine series (6. 5 percentage points), and the full series of Hib (6. 2 percentage points) . HepB birth dose coverage was higher among children living below the poverty level. Vaccination coverage varied widely by health insurance status, with highest coverage (other than for the HepB birth dose) among children with private insurance, and lowest among uninsured children (Table 2) . Compared with children who had private insurance, percentage point differences for children insured by Medicaid ranged from -2. 5 for 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine and 1 dose of varicella to -12. 0 for rotavirus vaccination, and for uninsured children, ranged from -12. 4 for 3 doses of HepB to -24. 9 for 4 doses of PCV. A higher percentage of uninsured children had received no vaccinations (3. 4%) compared with those insured by Medicaid (0. 8%) or private insurance (0. 6%) . Trends in Vaccination Coverage Coverage in 2016 was statistically significantly lower than in 2015 by 1. 3 to 2. 3 percentage points for 3 doses of DTaP, 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, the primary series of Hib, 3 doses of HepB, and 3 and 4 doses of PCV (Table 1) . Analysis of trends in coverage by age 2 years, by month and year of birth (3), indicated that coverage among children included in combined data from the 2015 and 2016 NIS-Child (born January 2012 through January 2015) did not change for any vaccination. When expanded to children included in the 20122016 NIS-Child (children born January 2009 through January 2015), coverage did not change for 4 doses of DTaP, 1 dose of MMR, the full series of Hib, 1 dose of varicella, and 4 doses of PCV (Figure) . Coverage over 12 consecutive birth months declined by 0. 3 percentage points for 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine and increased for 3 doses of HepB (0. 6 percentage points) and 2 doses of HepA (1. 7 percentage points) . Rotavirus vaccination coverage by age 19 months also increased by 1. 4 percentage points per 12 birth months. No differences in 2015 and 2016 survey respondent characteristics, changes in survey operations, or errors in processing of survey data were identified.

Disparities in coverage persisted for black children and those living below the poverty level, and coverage was generally lower for children who were uninsured or covered by Medicaid than among those with private insur - ance. These disparities indicate that improvements are needed in access to and delivery of age-appropriate immunization to all children, regardless of insurance or financial status (i. e. , the immunization safety net) . Health insurance and poverty status are interrelated factors associated with lower vaccination coverage in young children. Compared with children who had only private insurance, those with Medicaid had lower coverage, and those who were uninsured had much lower coverage, for most vaccines. Uninsured children, who account for 3. 0% of the 2016 NIS-Child weighted sample, are eligible for the VFC program, which was designed to increase access to vaccination among children through age 18 years who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay. Some families might not be aware of the VFC program, be unable to afford fees associated with visits to a vaccine provider, or might need assistance locating a physician who participates in the VFC program. Children living below poverty and up to a certain percentage above the poverty level are eligible for Medicaid (42. 5% of 2016 NIS-Child population met the minimum Medicaid eligibility level of 138%) and are entitled to VFC vaccines. Barriers to health care access and use among the publicly insured include language barriers, lack of trust in providers, transportation problems, inconvenient office hours, and other providerand system-level factors (4) .

CDC has undertaken a number of activities designed to elucidate potential barriers to early childhood vaccination from the perspective of the state immunization programs and health care providers enrolled in the VFC program. There are also plans to assess parental experience with and barriers to accessing vaccination services. Lower vaccination coverage among black children than among white children has been explained by differences in poverty status in past years (6), but in 2016, racial disparities were found among children living at or above the poverty level for some vaccines. This might reflect incomplete control for poverty status, because black children living above poverty could still live in lower income households, on average, than do white children. In the 2016 NIS-Child, the proportion of white children living in households with an income to poverty ratio of 4 was twice that of black children. During routine checks for accuracy of the 2016 NIS-Child data, statistically significant differences were observed in vac - cination coverage by age 19 months estimated from the 2016 compared with the 2015 surveys, among birth cohorts eligible to be included in both survey years (3, 7) . These differences were observed for 9 of the 15 vaccine doses evaluated and might indicate a systematic change in bias of the survey from 2015 to 2016. However, no differences were found in survey respon-dent characteristics and survey operations, and no errors were identified in processing of survey data; thus, it is possible that these differences might be attributable to random variation. The observed vaccination coverage differences among birth cohorts eligible for both survey years contributed to drops in annual estimates of vaccination coverage using the entire sample of survey respondents from 2015 to 2016, but do not provide evidence for change in vaccination coverage over time (3) . When trends were assessed more directly by month and year of birth from January 2012 through January 2015 (3), coverage by age 2 years was stable for all vaccines. When trends Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1176 MMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Vaccination is an effective method for reducing the impact of many diseases among young children in the United States. For over 20 years, the National Immunization Survey-Child has gathered data on children aged 1935 months to assess coverage with the vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) . What is added by this report? Coverage with most recommended vaccines remained stable and high in 2016; coverage was 90% for polio, measles, mumps, and rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B vaccines, and lowest (61%74%) for hepatitis A, the birth dose of hepatitis B, and rotavirus vaccines, and the combined 7-vaccine series. For most vaccines, coverage was lower among black children, children living below the federal poverty level, and children who were uninsured or covered by Medicaid compared with white children, children living at or above the federal poverty level, and children with private insurance. What are the implications for public health practice? Continued collaboration between CDC and state immunization programs to further elucidate and address disparities in coverage by poverty status should provide valuable information while strategies needed for improving access to and delivery of age-appropriate immunization are identified. Health care providers can increase vaccination coverage using evidence-based strategies such as provider reminders, standing orders to provide vaccination whenever appropriate, and immunization information systems. were assessed over a longer range of births, from January 2009 through January 2015, coverage was stable for most vaccines; for other vaccines, estimated change over twelve monthly birth cohorts was within one percentage point, and increased by 12 percentage points for rotavirus vaccination and 2 doses of HepA. Further evaluations of methods for assessing trends in survey accuracy and vaccination coverage using NIS-Child data are needed. Improved data quality of immunization informa-tion systems (IIS) will facilitate their use as another data source for population-based coverage assessment (8) . The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions that have been previously described, including exclusion of households without telephones, nonresponse bias, and incomplete vaccination histories reported by providers (6) . Total survey error has been evaluated in a sensitivity analysis accounting for these errors. Analyses of 2012 and 2013 data revealed that NIS-Child might have underestimated true vaccination coverage in those years by 4 percentage points for MMR, 5 percentage points for 4 doses of DTaP, and 5 percentage points for a 6-vaccine series that excluded PCV (9, 10) . Changes in annual vaccination coverage estimates should be interpreted with caution (3), particularly when they are smaller than the survey margin of error. These data indicate that the immunization safety net is not reaching all children early in life. Coverage could be increased with implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as provider reminders to eliminate missed opportunities to vaccinate, standing orders to provide vaccination whenever appropriate, and use of IIS to track vaccination administra - tion. *** In addition to maintaining the strong U. S. immuni - zation program, innovative approaches are needed to identify children not reached by the current safety net, including using local level IIS data. Continued vaccination coverage assessment using the NIS-Child will guide efforts to improve vaccination coverage. Data completeness and functionality of IIS have improved in recent years (8); however, additional progress is needed to maximize IIS utility for vaccination coverage assess - ments at state and local levels.

To monitor progress toward achieving IIS program goals, CDC surveys jurisdictions through an annual self-administered IIS Annual Report (IISAR) . Data from the 20132016 IISARs were analyzed to assess progress made in four priority areas: 1) data completeness, 2) bidirectional exchange of data with electronic health record systems, 3) clinical decision support for immunizations, and 4) ability to generate childhood vaccination cover - age estimates. IIS participation among children aged 4 months through 5 years increased from 90% in 2013 to 94% in 2016, and 33 jurisdictions reported 95% of children aged 4 months through 5 years participating in their IIS in 2016. Bidirectional messaging capacity in IISs increased from 25 jurisdictions in 2013 to 37 in 2016. In 2016, nearly all jurisdictions (52 of 55) could provide automated provider-level coverage reports, and 32 jurisdictions reported that their IISs could send vaccine forecasts to providers via Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging, up from 17 in 2013. Incremental progress was made in each area since 2013, but continued effort is needed to implement these critical functionalities among all IISs. Success in these priority areas, as defined by the IIS Functional Standards (1), bolsters clinicians and public health practitioners ability to attain high vaccination coverage in pediatric populations, and prepares IISs to develop more advanced functionalities to support state/local immunization services. Success in these priority areas also supports the achievement of federal immunization objectives, including the use of IISs as supplemental sampling frames for vaccination coverage surveys like the National Immunization Survey (NIS) -Child, reducing data collection costs, and sup - porting increased precision of state-level estimates. IISs, also known as immunization registries, are confiden - tial, computerized, population-based systems that collect and consolidate vaccination data from providers in a jurisdiction (2) . IISs increase vaccination rates and reduce vaccine-prevent - able diseases by enabling effective interventions (e. g. , client reminder and recall, provider assessment and feedback), track - ing patient immunizations, estimating vaccination coverage, * E xcluding the U. S. territories. and facilitating vaccine management and accountability (3) . For IISs to support real-time immunization efforts both at the population level and at the point of clinical care, these systems need to capture complete childhood immunization data. To promote IIS functionality and data quality, CDC and external partners, including state/local immunization programs and IIS vendors, developed 27 Functional Standards to guide IIS development from 2013 to 2017 (1) . CDC monitors progress toward these Functional Standards through a self-administered survey known as the IIS Annual Report (IISAR) . During 20162017, CDC issued guidance to jurisdictions identifying four priority areas (covering multiple Functional Standards) that immunization programs should focus on before develop-ing other IIS functionalities. The four priority areas are: 1) data completeness for children aged 06 years (Functional Standard 1. 1, 3. 1); 2) bidirectional information exchange with electronic health record systems (1. 4, 1. 5); 3) pediatric clinical decision support for immunizations (1. 2), and 4) ability to generate jurisdictional and provider-level childhood vaccination cover - age estimates (5. 2) . This report assesses progress toward achiev - ing success in these four priority areas from 2013 to 2016, using data from the 20132016 IISARs. IISAR is a secure web-based survey instrument distributed annually to state, local, and territorial immunization programs by CDC. Immunization programs self-report their IISs progress toward meeting the Functional Standards during the previous calendar year. Data completeness comprises four measures: birth record capture, child participation, provider participation, and IIS coverage estimate comparison to NIS-Child. These measures represent the ability of an IIS to capture the population within the jurisdiction as well as all vaccinations administered. Birth record capture is defined as the ability of an IIS to create patient records for all children who are born in a jurisdiction. Child participation is defined as the number of children aged 4 months through 5 years with 2 vaccinations recorded in the IIS, divided by the total U. S. Censusbased population estimate for the same age group in that jurisdiction. Provider participation is defined as the number of vaccination provider sites enrolled in an IIS that reported 1 vaccine doses to the IIS within the last 6 months of the preceding calendar year. IIS participation among the >40, 000 provider sites served by Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 1179 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe publicly funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program was analyzed. The comparison of IIS coverage estimates with estimates from NIS-Child measures an IISs success in captur - ing complete population and vaccination information within a jurisdiction.  Across all IIS jurisdictions, 106% of U. S. births were captured in IIS in 2016, an increase from 102% in 2013. Childhood IIS participation increased from 90% in 2013 to 94% in 2016, which approaches the Healthy People 2020 objective of 95% child IIS participation. Among the 55 jurisdictions, 33 (60%) reported that 95% of children aged 4 months through 5 years in their geographic area participated in their IIS in 2016, compared with 24 (44%) in 2013. In 2016, provider participation was 85% among VFC provider sites enrolled in an IIS. The number of VFC provider sites enrolled in an IIS decreased from 41, 710 in 2014 to 41, 393 in 2016. Among these enrolled sites, the number of VFC provider sites participating in an IIS increased slightly from 33, 266 in 2013 to 34, 662 in 2016 (Figure 1) . For the combined 7-vaccine series, ** the number of jurisdictions with IIS estimates within 10 percentage points of the corresponding NIS-Child coverage estimates increased from 17 in 2013 to 25 in 2016 (Figure 2) . In 2016, 30 IISs had 7-vaccine series coverage estimates that were at least 10 percent - age points lower than the corresponding NIS-Child estimate. Bidirectional information exchange allows providers to sub - mit immunization data directly from electronic health records (EHRs) to IISs, and to request and receive immunization infor - mation from IISs into EHRs for the patients they serve. HL7 messaging is a nationally recognized platform-independent  The Vaccines for Children program provides vaccines at no cost to eligible children, including those whose parents or guardians might not be able to afford vaccines. https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index. html.  NIS-Child is a nationally r epresentative survey that estimates vaccination coverage among children aged 19 35 months using provider-reported vaccination data. Many factors can potentially affect the calculated percentage point differences between IIS and NIS-Child estimates, including possible errors in IIS vaccination and population calculations, errors in NIS-Child (such as random error, selection bias, and underascertainment of vaccination status), variability in data completeness in individual IIS, and other methodological differences between NIS-Child and IISs. Despite these limitations, the NIS-Child is well established as a reliable indicator of childhood vaccination rates, and serves as a useful holistic benchmark for assessing an IIS performance in capturing recorded doses administered within its jurisdiction.  Comp arisons were made with U. S. Census estimates for children aged <1 year in 2016. Birth record capture percentages often exceed 100% because of newborn data being recorded in more than one IIS (e. g. , a child who is born in 1 state but who is a resident in a different state might be recorded in both IISs), and because of incomplete inactivation of records of children who move out of a jurisdiction. * * 4 doses of diphtheria and tetanus to xoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine full series; 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine; 1 doses of varicella vaccine; and 4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

In 2016, 91% of jurisdictions had an IIS that used HL7 version 2. 5. 1 to receive vaccination histories from providers and returned acknowledgment messages, compared with 87% in 2013. Furthermore, in 2016, 67% of jurisdictions had an IIS that received requests for vaccination histories and returned responses to those requests, compared with 45% in 2013 (Figure 3) . Finally, in 2016, 78% of jurisdictions had an IIS that could transmit immunization data using Simple Object Access Protocol, the CDC-endorsed transport standard for the exchange of immunization information, compared with 75% of jurisdictions reporting this capability in 2013 (4) . Clinical Decision Support (CDS) functionalities enable providers to evaluate the validity of vaccine doses admin - istered to patients and forecast future vaccines that will be needed, based on recommendations developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. From 2013 to 2016, all jurisdictions IISs had CDS capabilities that were available to providers through the IISs user interface. In 2016, 58% (32 of 55) of jurisdictions reported sending a vaccine forecast to another system via HL7 messaging. This is an 87% increase from 2013, when 31% (17 of 55) of jurisdictions reported performing this task.

IISs can be used to generate coverage estimates for childhood vaccinations at the jurisdictional level (e. g. , state, postal code, or county) and at the provider level to identify vulnerable sub - populations. In 2016, 89% of jurisdictions (49 of 55) provided a predefined, automatic report on immunization coverage by geography. This is 11% higher than in 2013, when 80% of jurisdictions provided these reports. In 2016, 95% of jurisdic - tions (52 of 55) provided a predefined, automatic report on immunization coverage by provider site. This is 7% higher than in 2013, when 89% of jurisdictions reported providing these reports. Discussion Since 2013, incremental progress was noted in each of the four priority areas for immunization programs that were assessed. Notably, the increased number of jurisdictions that had IIS estimates that were within 10 percentage points of the corresponding NIS-Child coverage estimate suggests that more jurisdictions have IISs with more complete data, or at least that the IIS and NIS are similar in their ability to estimate vaccina - tion coverage for that jurisdictions population. Jurisdictions with IIS coverage estimates that were at least 10 percentage FIGURE 3.

Achievement of unidirectional functionality is a prerequisite to achieving bidirectional functionality. https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/programs/iis/technical-guidance/ downloads/hl7guide-1-5-2014-11. pdf. points lower than the corresponding NIS-Child estimate might have less complete IIS data, particularly at sites with the largest IISNIS discrepancies. By prioritizing resources to the identified priority areas, jurisdictions can make substantial progress in this important subset of activities rather than incremental progress across all Functional Standards. Improvements in priority areas can also support a broader range of immunization services; for example, improved data completeness for children aged <6 years would strengthen immunization delivery for this population (Functional Standard 1. 11. 3) and increase VFC program accountability (2. 12. 6) . In addition, as IISs identify more children and record all doses administered within their jurisdiction, IIS-based vaccination coverage estimates will be able to supplement estimates from surveys like the NIS-Child (5) . IISs are integral components of routine clinical practice and public health surveillance for immunization. Availability of more complete IIS data also offer many benefits to health care providers and public health practitioners, including consolidat - ing patients vaccination histories, identifying undervaccinated subgroups, and forecasting the needs of individual patients for recommended vaccines (3) . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 1181 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? In 2012, 86% of U. S. children aged 4 months through 5 years (19. 5 million) had 2 doses recorded in immunization informa-tion systems (IISs) . What is added by this report? From 2013 to 2016, the percentage of children with 2 immunizations recorded in IISs increased from 90% to 94%, approaching the Healthy People 2020 objective of 95%. However, variability in IIS pediatric data quality persists: 30 of 55 IISs produced 7-vaccine series coverage rates that were at least 10 percentage points lower than the corresponding National Immunization Survey-Child coverage rate in 2016, suggesting incompleteness of IIS data. Across all IISs, there was progress in achieving bidirectional information exchange with electronic health record systems, pediatric clinical decision support for immunizations, and the ability to generate jurisdictional and provider-level childhood vaccination coverage estimates. What are the implications for public health practice? To realize the full benefits of IISs, immunization programs need to implement strategies that prioritize and align resources to achieve functionality and high data quality in four focus areas: 1) pediatric data completeness, 2) bidirectional data exchange with electronic health record systems, 3) clinical decision support for immunizations, and 4) ability to generate childhood vaccination coverage estimates. Strategies such as implement - ing best practices, adhering to national standards, and incorpo - rating independent third-party assessments can reduce variability across IISs, and support IIS full potential to facilitate complete vaccination of U. S. children against vaccine-prevent - able diseases. Standards and best practices exist that can guide IIS develop - ment and maintenance activities, including the IIS Functional Standards (1), national standards for the electronic exchange of immunization information, CDS resources, and data quality best practices. Alignment with these standards and best practices reduces variability across IISs and helps IISs use resources more efficiently to provide the most value for immunization programs, providers, patients, and parents.

Continuously monitoring the progress of each IIS can also help jurisdictions identify areas for improvement. Such monitoring is done using the IISAR or other tools, such as an initiative to assess, measure, and validate IISs that was recently developed by the American Immunization Registry Association (6) . The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi - tations. First, results were self-reported and might be subject to response bias. Second, only a subset of the Functional Standards pertaining to the four priority areas was analyzed in this report; this evaluation was not a comprehensive analysis of the progress made in all Functional Standards. Finally, reported capacity of a functionality does not necessarily indicate active utilization of that functionality. This was the first systematic assessment of progress in four priority areas that are foundational for IISs. Incorporating strategies such as prioritizing activities, aligning resources, implementing best practices, adhering to national standards, and implementing independent third-party assessments can promote consistency across jurisdictions, encourage program accountability, ensure quality standards, and help IISs more rapidly attain their full potential to facilitate complete vac - cination of U. S. children against vaccine-preventable diseases.

Rapid proliferation and accumulation of potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria characterize one type of harmful algal bloom (HAB) . HABs have the potential to cause illness in humans and animals (2, 3); however, the epidemiology of these illnesses has not been well characterized. Statewide in 2015, a total of 139 HABs were identified in New York, 97 (70%) of which were confirmed through laboratory analysis; 77 independent beach closures were ordered at 37 beaches on 20 different bodies of water. To better characterize HAB-associated illnesses, during JuneSeptember 2015, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) implemented a pilot surveillance system in 16 New York counties. Activities included the collection of data from environmental HAB reports, illness reports, poison control centers, and syndromic surveillance, and increased outreach to the public, health care providers, and veterinarians. During JuneSeptember, 51 HAB-associated illnesses were reported, including 35 that met the CDC case definitions*; 32 of the cases occurred in humans and three in dogs. In previous years, New York never had more than 10 HAB-associated ill - nesses reported statewide. The pilot surveillance results from 16 counties during a 4-month period suggest that HAB-associated illnesses might be more common than previously reported. Exposure to HABs through contact, inhalation, or ingestion of contaminated water can cause illness in humans and animals (2, 3) . Signs and symptoms associated with HAB exposure have occurred from exposure to cyanobacteria in situations in which toxins were not detected (4, 5) . Symptoms associated with HAB exposure can include skin reactions, eye irritation, * S uspected human and animal cases required exposure to water, algae, seafood, or dietary harmful algal bloom (HAB) sources; signs or symptoms following an HAB exposure; and a public health assessment of whether the illness was likely HAB-related. For animals, assessments also could have been completed by qualified nonpublic health entities that were identified by state or federal agency partners. Probable human and animal cases met the suspected case definition and, in addition, were required to have a professional medical diagnosis or have been supported by either observational or HAB environmental laboratory data. Confirmed human and animal cases met the suspected case definition and were required to have HAB clinical laboratory data plus either 1) a professional medical diagnosis or rule-out of other causes of illness; or 2) a professional medical diagnosis, rule-out of other causes of illness, and HAB environmental laboratory data. https: //www. cdc. gov/habs/pdf/ohhabs-caseand-event-definitions-table-3-14-17. pdf. ear irritation, liver damage, and gastrointestinal, respiratory, and neurologic signs and symptoms (13) . One Health is a concept that encompasses the interrelated - ness of human and animal health and the environment and recognizes that health outcomes might be optimized through multidisciplinary collaboration. The application of a One Health approach to HABs might result in the development of improved public health prevention and response efforts (6, 7) . To better understand the occurrence of HABs and the epide - miology of cyanobacteria HAB-associated illnesses NYSDOH implemented a pilot surveillance system in 2015, applying a One Health approach in a subset of counties overseen by local health departments (LHDs) . NYSDOH selected 16 (26%) of 62 New York counties for participation in the pilot surveillance system based on the likeli - hood of an HAB occurrence within their jurisdiction and the LHDs interest in participation. Public health workers from each participating county attended a training webinar and received an electronic package of surveillance tools, including health outreach documents for the general public, health care provid - ers, and veterinarians; human and animal illness questionnaires; and illness reporting forms adapted from CDCs One Health Harmful Algal Bloom System materials (8) . During June September 2015, HAB-associated human and animal illnesses and environmental HAB occurrences reported by LHDs and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) were submitted to NYSDOH. NYSDEC was the main source of information regarding environmental HAB occurrence, location, and laboratory confirmation. A program within NYSDEC evaluates bodies of water for HABs in response to reports of possible HABs from the public, various park staffs, and lake associations. NYSDEC notified NYSDOH of any possible or laboratory-confirmed HABs within 24 hours so that a response (e. g. , closing the beach) could be implemented promptly. NYSDEC also noti - fied the relevant LHDs and lake associations, when applicable. When there is visual evidence of an HAB (e. g. , visible scum or discolored water consistent with an HAB) at a regulated bathing beach in New York, the jurisdiction with authority over the beach requires it to be closed to swimming, wading, and other water contact. Visual evidence, as opposed to toxin monitoring, is used to trigger beach closures because of the risk for illness from both toxin-producing and nontoxin-producing Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 1183 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionHABs and the variability in the location and length of HAB occurrences. In such instances, water contact was prohibited until the HAB was no longer visible in the beach area for at least 1 day, and testing with commercially available algal toxindetecting test strips had determined that concentrations of cyanobacterial toxins were below the recommended guidance value of 10 g/L (9) . Using the combination of visualization and test strip approach allows for more immediate protective measures than laboratory confirmation of HABs, which might take several days to complete. Visual evidence in water bodies other than bathing beaches is also used as a trigger for LHDs to alert the public via social media, websites, press releases, and advisory signs. As part of the pilot surveillance system, outreach materials were disseminated through NYSDOH and NYSDEC websites, a veterinary magazine, and presentations and flyers at various meetings involving lake and water quality associa - tions. Outreach materials encouraged members of the public who had a suspected exposure to report symptoms to their LHD. Additional surveillance activities were implemented by NYSDOH when an HAB was identified that posed a sub - stantial public health concern affecting drinking water or recreational water activities. Such surveillance activities included 1) monitoring hospital syndromic surveillance data for patients who displayed symptoms consistent with HAB exposure, 2) providing educational materials to health care providers and veterinarians near the sites of HABs, and 3) coordinating with poison control centers to notify NYSDOH if suspected HAB exposure calls were received. HAB-associated illnesses were voluntarily reported to NYSDOH through participating counties, NYSDEC, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, and a veterinary office. Each report of illness was investigated using a questionnaire administered by either the LHD or NYSDOH and assessed using the CDC case defini - tions for HAB-associated illness. Case definitions are specific to animals and humans and take into consideration information such as environmental or visual evidence of an HAB, confirma - tion via toxin-detecting test strips, or laboratory confirmation (i. e. , via microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, or density of blue green chlorophyll) along with clinical evidence of HAB expo - sure (e. g. , consistency of symptoms and onset of illness after exposure) . During JuneSeptember 2015, NYSDOH received 51 HAB-associated illness reports from the pilot surveillance system, 35 (68. 8%) of which met the CDC case definitions, including 32 in humans and three in dogs. Among those patients with such data available, median age of the humans was 24 years (263 years) and median age of the dogs was 7 years (212 years); 18 (56%) of the humans and one of the dogs were female. One (3%) of the 32 human cases was clas - sified as confirmed, 20 (57%) as probable, and 11 (31%) as suspected. All three canine cases were classified as probable. Among cases that occurred in humans, skin problems were reported by 22 (69%) patients (Table) . No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among humans. All human cases were associated with exposure to HABs in recreational water. Recreational activities included swimming (28 patients; 88%); wakeboarding, jet skiing, waterskiing or tubing (seven; 22%); boating (seven; 22%); wading (six; 19%); and using personal watercraft (four; 13%) . All three affected dogs had gastroin - testinal symptoms, and two were hospitalized; the third dogs symptoms resolved without intervention, and none of the dogs died. One dog was associated with human cases. The dogs were exposed to HABs in recreational water and, according to their owners, might have ingested water or algae. Discussion HAB-associated illness reports made to NYSDOH before 2015 never exceeded 10 statewide in any given year, whereas 51 illness reports were made through a pilot surveillance system in 16 New York counties during JuneSeptember 2015. Of the 51 reports identified through the pilot surveillance system, 35 were considered cases of HAB-associated illness that met the CDC case definition, suggesting that such illnesses might be underreported. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, self-reported illnesses and exposures can be subject to inaccuracy and bias. Second, surveillance for HAB-associated illnesses is difficult because HABassociated signs and symptoms are nonspecific (e. g. , skin rash, nausea, or diarrhea); the frequent lack of data showing these illnesses are causally linked to HAB exposure leads to a case defini - tion with low specificity. Finally, all of the pilot counties had experienced at least one HAB in a water body in the previous season. Therefore, the pilot counties might represent commu-nities more aware of HABs and their potential health effects. Developing partnerships with local, state, and federal partners using a One Health approach assisted NYSDOH in successfully implementing a pilot surveillance system through identification of environmental HAB events, illness identification and reporting, and outreach to the public, lake associations, physicians, and veterinarians. NYSDECs HAB monitoring program supported NYSDOH efforts to implement an HAB-associated illness surveillance system through the identification of HABs and public outreach. Collaboration with other organizations, such as lake asso - ciations, medical and veterinary organizations, and poison control centers, might have helped to establish reporting of HAB-associated illnesses.

Recreational water exposure to excessive growths of cyano - bacteria, called harmful algal blooms (HABs), can result in adverse health effects in humans and animals. Although HAB-associated illnesses and outbreaks have been docu-mented in recent years, the extent and severity of these illnesses have not been well described. What is added by this report? In 2015, New York implemented a pilot cyanobacteria HAB-associated illness surveillance system in 16 counties. During JuneSeptember, 51 human and canine HABassociated illnesses were reported, including 35 that met the CDC case definition. What are the implications for public health practice? HAB-associated illnesses might be more common than has been previously reported. Establishing working relationships with local health departments, environmental agencies, medical and veterinary organizations, poison control centers, and lake associations can provide important partnerships for public health response to HABs.

Diop, PhD2; Jane Iber, MSc1; Elizabeth Henderson1; Roland W. Sutter, MD3; Steven G. F. Wassilak, MD4; Cara C. Burns, PhD1 In 1988, the World Health Assembly launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) (1) . Among the three wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. Since 2014, detection of WPV1 has been limited to three countries, with 37 cases in 2016 and 11 cases in 2017 as of September 27. The >99. 99% decline worldwide in polio cases since the launch of the GPEI is attributable to the extensive use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in mass vaccination campaigns and comprehensive national routine immunization programs. Despite its wellestablished safety record, OPV use can be associated with rare emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (2) . VDPVs can also emerge among persons with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) . Immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can replicate for years in some persons with PIDs. In addition, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can emerge very rarely among immunologically normal vaccine recipients and their contacts in areas with inadequate OPV coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. This report updates pre - vious summaries regarding VDPVs (3) . During January 2016 June 2017, new cVDPV outbreaks were identified, including two in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (eight cases), and another in Syria (35 cases), whereas the circulation of cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria resulted in cVDPV2 detection linked to a previous emergence. The last confirmed case from the 20152016 cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Laos occurred in January 2016. Fourteen newly identified persons in 10 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs, and three previously reported patients in the United Kingdom and Iran (3) were still excreting type 2 iVDPV (iVDPV2) during the reporting period. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates that cannot be classified definitively, were found among immuno - competent persons and environmental samples in 10 countries. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for new VDPV infections. WPV type 2 (WPV2) was last detected in 1999 and global WPV2 eradication was declared in September 2015; WPV type 3 has not been detected since 2012. Since August 2014, residual endemic WPV1 transmission has been detected only in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, mostly in inaccessible areas. In response to the emergence of multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated the synchronized withdrawal of the type 2 component (OPV2; Sabin type 2) from trivalent OPV (tOPV; Sabin types 1, 2, and 3) (4) . In April 2016, all OPV-using countries switched to bivalent OPV (bOPV; Sabin types 1 and 3) . Since the switch, the number of isolated Sabin 2 strains from both acute flaccid paralysis and environmental surveillance systems has steadily declined (5) . To monitor the disappearance of Sabin 2 strains and to ensure identification of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), as of August 1, 2016, all poliovirus type 2 (PV2) isolates are referred for genetic sequencing. Properties and Virologic Characterization of VDPVs Poliovirus isolates are grouped into three categories: WPV, vaccine-related poliovirus (VRPV), and VDPV. VRPVs have limited divergence in the capsid protein (VP1) nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (poliovirus type 1 and 3 [PV1 and PV3]: 1% divergent; poliovirus type 2: 0. 6% divergent) (3) . VDPVs are >1% divergent (for PV1 and PV3) or >0. 6% divergent (for PV2) in VP1 nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (3) . VDPVs are further classified as 1) cVDPVs, when evidence of person-toperson transmission in the community exists; 2) iVDPVs, when they are isolated from persons with PIDs; and 3) aVDPVs, when they are clinical isolates from persons with no known immunodeficiency and no evidence of transmission, or they are sewage isolates that are unrelated to other known VDPVs and whose source is unknown (2) . GPEI guidelines about reporting and classification of VDPVs were last updated in August 2016 (http: //polioeradication. org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ Reporting-and-Classification-of-VDPVs_Aug2016_EN. pdf) . All poliovirus isolates are characterized by laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network. VDPV screening is conducted using real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid amplification, targeted to nucleotide substitutions that frequently revert to the parental WPV sequence during replication of OPV in the human intes - tine (6) . Starting August 1, 2016, the use of the VDPV2 screen - ing assay was discontinued and all PV2 isolates are sequenced. Potential VDPVs identified by real-time RT-PCR screening are sequenced in the VP1 region for definitive analysis.

No additional cases have been identified from previously reported VDPV outbreaks in Guinea (cVDPV2), Madagascar (cVDPV1), Myanmar (cVDPV2), Ukraine (cVDPV1), Pakistan (cVDPV2) and Nigeria (cVDPV2) . Cases continued to be identified from the previously reported distinct cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria (7) and the previously reported cVDPV1 outbreak in Laos (3) . New outbreaks were reported in DRC (two cVDPV2 emergences; one with six cases and one with two cases), Nigeria (cVDPV2, one case), Pakistan (cVDPV2, one case), and Syria (cVDPV2, 35 cases) (Table) . Detection of the new cVDPV2 outbreaks occurred after the global tOPV to bOPV switch (April 2016) . During January 2016June 2017, among 48 cVDPV cases, 45 (93%) were cVDPV2 (Table) (Figure 2) .

Pakistan. During October 2016December 2016, a new cVDPV2 emergence was reported in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan. Five cVDPV2s (with 1. 0%2. 0% VP1 nucleotide divergence) were detected, four from sewage samples collected in two distinct environmental sites during three consecutive months (most recent sample date December 28, 2016) and one from an AFP patient with paralysis onset on December 17, 2016. Syria. Syria is facing a humanitarian crisis because of armed conflict, and during March 2017June 2017, cVDPV2s were isolated from 35 AFP patients and 27 contacts in two governor - ates (Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa) .  The outbreak was associated with an emergence first observed in a child aged 22 months with onset of paralysis on March 3, 2017. Among 32 AFP cases, 29 (90%) were identified in the Mayadeen district of Deir Ez-Zor governorate. The extent of VP1 nucleotide diver - gence from the parental Sabin 2 strain among all cVDPV2s was 2. 3%3. 1% VP1 nucleotide divergence. Reported OPV coverage was low (48%) and in response to the outbreak, mOPV2 mass vaccination campaigns were conducted during July (Deir Ez-Zor) and August (Raqqa), reaching an estimated 350, 000 children. Detection of iVDPVs During January 2016June 2017, 17 iVDPV infections were reported from 11 countries (Table), including 14 that were newly detected iVDPV infections. During this reporting period, with the exception of three type 3 iVDPVs (iVDPV3), all were type 2. Since introduction of OPV, the cumulative serotype distribution shows that iVDPV2 are the most common (69%), followed by type 3 (14%) type 1 (12%) and heterotypic mixtures (i. e. , FIGURE 2.

A girl aged 65 months with agammaglobulinemia was infected with iVDPV2 and developed AFP in February 2016. An iVDPV3 infection in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency without AFP was first detected in January 2015; the last sample from this patient that was positive for iVDPV3 was collected in August 2016. Samples collected since October 2016 were negative for type 3 VDPVs (VDPV3) . Iran.

Discussion The number of reported cVDPV outbreaks has decreased from nine to seven since the January 2015May 2016 report-ing period (3); however, the total number of reported cVDPV cases in these outbreaks has increased. Control and interrup-tion of cVDPV2 outbreaks in areas at high risk for cVDPV emergence is partly attributable to steadily improving quality of supplementary immunization activities  and increased access to unimmunized children. For example, the large cVDPV2 outbreaks reported in Nigeria, Chad, and Pakistan during the last 5 years were interrupted; however, residual detection of cVDPV2s at the subnational level is indicative of persistent pockets of underimmunized children in mostly inaccessible areas (7) . The new cVDPV2 outbreaks in DRC and Syria high - light the importance of maintaining high levels of poliovirus immunity, as well as sensitive AFP surveillance. Expanded environmental surveillance in countries at high risk for poliovirus (PV) importation or VDPV emergence has increased the sensitivity of poliovirus detection and has played a critical role in monitoring residual PV2 excretion after OPV2 cessation. Despite the logistical and technical challenges of detecting and sequencing polioviruses from sewage samples, environmental surveillance remains critical in not only increas - ing the sensitivity of both WPV and VDPV detection, but also accelerating the GPEI response (8) . During the reporting period, VDPV2s were detected both before and after the global withdrawal of OPV2 in April 2016. During the preswitch period (January 2016April 2016), emer - gence of cVDPV2 in countries with low routine vaccination coverage underscored the risks of widening immunization gaps to PV2; detection of highly divergent cVDPV2s from sewage samples collected in the state capital adjacent to inaccessible areas of northeast Nigeria also indicated virus circulation that Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1190 MMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), strains that are genetically divergent from the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) viruses, fall into three categories: 1) circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) from outbreaks, 2) immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) from patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), and 3) ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), which cannot be more definitively identified. cVDPVs are biologically equivalent to wild polioviruses, emerge in settings of low population immunity, and can sustain long-term circulation. Because >94% of cVDPVs since 2006 and 69% of iVDPVs since OPV introduction are type 2, the World Health Organization coordinated worldwide replacement of trivalent OPV (tOPV, types 1, 2, and 3) with bivalent OPV (bOPV, types 1 and 3) in April 2016. What is added by this report? During 2017, new cVDPV outbreaks were detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (two emergences) and Syria (one emergence) . Residual circulation of a previous cVDPV2 emergence in Nigeria was detected in 2016 and low-level detection of new emergences in Nigeria and Pakistan occurred during 2016. Fourteen newly identified persons in 10 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs. What are the implications for public health practice? The goal of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is the cessation of all poliovirus circulation. The risk for VDPV emer - gence will continue as long as OPV is used. The switch from tOPV to bOPV in April 2016 was the first step toward phasing out the use of all OPV, setting the stage for a subsequent total worldwide shift from OPV to IPV. was missed by AFP surveillance. cVDPV2 outbreaks detected after the switch in both Syria and DRC highlighted the risks associated with chronically low tOPV vaccination coverage before the switch. Outbreak response to VDPV2 transmission after OPV2 cessation requires use of mOPV2; the scope and intensity of mOPV2 vaccination campaigns in outbreak areas is assessed by the mOPV2 Advisory Group, which advises the WHO Director General on release of mOPV2. Response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria included two mOPV2 mass vac - cination campaigns targeting >300, 000 children aged <5 years, followed by inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) vaccination cam - paigns targeting >100, 000 children aged 224 months, includ - ing populations at high risk in adjacent areas and countries. In April 2016, all 155 OPV-using countries and territories switched from tOPV to bOPV; the number of countries reporting PV2 detection decreased 83%, from 42 before the switch to seven after the switch (JanuaryMarch 2017) (5) . The GPEI and Global Polio Laboratory Network have continued to strengthen AFP and poliovirus surveillance. In addition, the increase in the number of environmental surveillance sites has enhanced PV detection (9) . Routine immunization services also are being strengthened, and most countries incorporated at least 1 dose of IPV into routine childhood immunization schedules in 2016. Augmented surveillance for VDPV infec - tions among patients with PID (10) has increased the number of known iVDPV excretors. Continued progress in develop-ment of antivirals is needed to eliminate virus shedding in persons with chronic iVDPV infections. During the last 5 years, the number of WPV cases (>400 in 2013; 12 in 2017) was lower than the estimated number (250500) of global vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis cases.  The ultimate goal of the polio endgame strategic plan is the global cessation of all OPV use after the end of all WPV circulation, which started with cessation of OPV with a type 2 component. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for cVDPV outbreaks, and new iVDPV and aVDPV infections.

Parashar, MBBS2 Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe pediatric diarrhea globally, estimated to have caused 120, 000 deaths among children aged <5 years in sub-Saharan Africa in 2013 (1) . In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) recom - mended rotavirus vaccination for all infants worldwide (2) . T wo rotavirus vaccines are currently licensed globally: the monovalent Rotarix vaccine (RV1, GlaxoSmithKline; 2-dose series) and the pentavalent RotaTeq vaccine (RV5, Merck; 3-dose series) . This report describes progress of rotavirus vac - cine introduction (3), coverage (using estimates from WHO and the United Nations Childrens Fund [UNICEF]) (4), and impact on pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations in the WHO African Region. By December 2016, 31 (66%) of 47 countries in the WHO African Region had introduced rotavirus vaccine, including 26 that introduced RV1 and five that introduced RV5. Among these countries, rotavirus vaccination coverage (completed series) was 77%, according to WHO/UNICEF population-weighted estimates. In 12 countries with surveil - lance data available before and after vaccine introduction, the proportion of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations that were rotavirus-positive declined 33%, from 39% preintroduction to 26% following rotavirus vaccine introduction. These results support introduction of rotavirus vaccine in the remaining countries in the region and continuation of rotavirus surveil - lance to monitor impact. The status of rotavirus vaccine introduction and 2016 WHO/UNICEF estimates of national vaccination coverage were obtained from the WHO repository (3, 4) . Among African Region countries that have introduced rotavirus vaccine into their national Expanded Programs on Immunization, most recommend that rotavirus doses coincide with administra - tion of the infant doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP) vaccine (at ages 6 and 10 weeks for RV1 and at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks for RV5); most countries are using RV1 (5) . Because the WHO/UNICEF estimates do not include a coverage estimate for the first dose of rotavirus vaccine or the second dose of DTP vaccine, rotavirus vaccination cover - age (completed series of either 2 RV1 or 3 RV5 doses) was compared with first-dose and third-dose coverage for DTP. Countries that have introduced rotavirus vaccine were grouped by year of vaccine introduction for analysis. Rotavirus surveillance data were collected through sentinel hospitals participating in the African Rotavirus Surveillance Network (ARSN), which was established in four countries in 2006 and had expanded to 29 countries by 2016 (Figure) (6) . Surveillance staff members at sentinel sites in ARSN enroll children aged <5 years who are hospitalized for acute diarrhea (3 looser than normal stools in a 24-hour period before hospitalization, with duration of illness 7 days before hospitalization) and collect a stool specimen, which is tested for rotavirus using an enzyme immunoassay. Countries were included in this analysis if their sites collected and tested at least 80 specimens over at least 11 months in a given year. The percentage of tested specimens that were positive for rotavirus was calculated in the vaccine preintroduction and postintroduction periods, by country. The year of rotavirus vaccine introduction was considered a transition period and was excluded from calculations. FIGURE.

Overall, 31 (66%) countries in the region had introduced rotavirus vaccine into their national immunization schedules by December 2016, with 26 introducing RV1 and five introducing RV5 (Table 1) . Among all countries, completed series rotavirus vaccination coverage was 77% (population-weighted average); national coverage ranged from 24% (Sao Tome and Principe, 2016 introduction) to 98% (Rwanda, 2012 introduction) . When grouping by year of vaccine introduction, the highest overall population-weighted coverage (82%) was in countries that introduced the vaccine before 2014. These same countries also had the smallest average percentage-point difference between completed rotavirus vaccination coverage and DTP1 coverage (overall, 11 percentage points less than DTP1) . Surveillance data were available for 12 and 18 countries dur - ing the vaccine preintroduction and postintroduction periods, respectively (Table 2) . The average percentage of tested stool specimens that were positive for rotavirus during the vaccine preintroduction period was 41%, ranging from 20% (Ethiopia) to 51% (Togo) .

In 2016, the overall percentage of positive rotavirus stool specimens was 26% in countries that had introduced the vaccine in 2015 or earlier, and 43% in countries that had not yet introduced the vaccine (p<0. 001) . Discussion Countries in the WHO African Region have made sig - nificant progress in the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, with 31 (66%) of 47 member countries having introduced rotavirus vaccine into their national schedules by December 2016. In 2016, the overall completed series rotavirus vaccina-tion coverage in these countries was 77%, which was lower than coverage for DTP1 and DTP3. Some of this difference might be attributable to challenges that are common to new vaccine introduction (e. g. , it can take time for all vaccination clinics to have reliable cold chain space and a steady stock of a new vaccine) . In addition, challenges specific to the recording and reporting of coverage for new vaccines include mid-year introductions, unavailability of updated data tools, and inad - equate orientation of health workers on use of vaccine tally sheets. Another factor specific to rotavirus is the issue of age restrictions. Because of concerns about a potential increased risk for intussusception in older infants who receive the vaccine, WHO initially recommended that rotavirus vaccination be administered only to children aged 32 weeks (2) . In 2013, WHO recommended lifting these restrictions based on new data and a risk-benefit analysis (7); however, some countries, or some health workers, might still be administering rotavirus vaccine with age restrictions. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of lifting age restrictions on coverage, and the difference between rotavirus and DTP vac - cination coverage. Surveillance data from ARSN indicate that, among countries with data available both preceding and following rotavirus vaccine introduction, the proportion of rotavirus-positive hospitalizations for diarrhea among children aged <5 years declined 33% following rotavirus vaccine introduction; overall declines were especially notable in countries that had introduced rotavirus vaccine before 2015. These results are particularly encouraging given rotavirus vaccines lower efficacy Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 1195 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe pediatric diarrhea worldwide, and a disproportionate number of deaths occur in countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region. WHO recommends rotavirus vaccination for all infants worldwide. What is added by this report? As of December 2016, 31 of 47 (66%) countries in the WHO African Region had introduced rotavirus vaccination into their national schedules. Among these countries, the overall coverage for the completed series of rotavirus vaccination was 77% in 2016. In 12 countries with available sentinel hospital surveillance data before and after rotavirus vaccine introduc - tion, the proportion of pediatric diarrhea hospitalizations that were rotavirus-positive declined 33%, from 39% to 26%. What are the implications for public health practice? Continued commitment to improving rotavirus vaccination coverage in the WHO African Region should contribute to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Maintaining and enhancing the existing surveillance network will be critical to the ability to measure vaccine impact. in low-income settings (50%64% efficacy) than in highincome and middle-income settings (85%100% efficacy) (8), which had raised concerns about the public health impact of their introduction. However, consistent with recent global analyses demonstrating substantial rotavirus vaccine impact across country income strata (9), the present analysis suggests that rotavirus vaccination has had a meaningful impact on rotavirus disease in Africa. Sixteen countries in the WHO African Region had not yet introduced rotavirus vaccine as of December 2016; 10 are eligible for Gavi financial support, four of which have received approval. Apart from funding, other factors can affect rotavirus vaccine introduction and subsequent coverage. Coverage with routinely recommended vaccines, as a marker of immunization system function, highlights several countries in the region where the immunization infrastructure needs strengthening. Armed conflict and natural disasters, experienced by several countries in the region, can further stress immunization ser - vices. Even under routine circumstances, cold chain manage - ment, vaccine transportation, and human resource constraints can negatively affect vaccination coverage; these challenges might be experienced most acutely in countries with large rural populations. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, UNICEF/WHO coverage estimates are based on the best estimates of a combination of administrative data and survey data, each of which might be subject to overreporting or underreporting. Other factors potentially causing a discrepancy between rotavirus coverage and DTP coverage include the inability to compare the final dose of RV1 to the second dose of DTP, and the lack of data on coverage with the first dose of rotavirus vaccines. Second, although protocols for rotavirus surveillance are standardized across the entire network, there are a limited number of surveillance sites in each country; these might not be representative of pediatric diarrheal illness across the country and might provide an incomplete picture of impact. Third, immunization and surveillance data quality vary among countries. Fourth, not all sites have been able to conduct continuous rotavirus disease surveillance, and data were not included in these results if analysis criteria were not met. Finally, rotavirus surveillance data are not available for all countries before introduction, limiting the ability to assess vaccine impact in countries without vaccine preintroduction data or those that are not part of the ARSN. Overall, substantial progress has been made in the introduc - tion of rotavirus vaccine and surveillance for rotavirus disease in countries in the WHO African Region. In countries where rotavirus vaccine has been introduced, a substantial decline in the percentage of rotavirus-associated pediatric diarrhea hos - pitalizations was observed. As rotavirus vaccination coverage increases, an even greater decline might be expected; however, continuous surveillance is a critical component of measuring vaccine impact. Financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has played a key role in rotavirus vaccine introduc-tion and rotavirus surveillance in the region (10) . Nonetheless, Gavi support will not continue indefinitely; as their economies improve, countries will graduate from Gavi support and begin to finance the total cost of the vaccine. Maintaining surveillance for rotavirus disease will provide important data necessary to promoting continued investment in rotavirus vaccination. Rotavirus vaccination is a critical element in reducing child deaths from diarrhea and contributing to the improvement of child health globally. Acknowledgment Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

ODonnell, PhD1; John Halpin, MD1; Christine L. Mattson, PhD1; Bruce A. Goldberger, PhD2; R. Matthew Gladden, PhD1 On October 27, 2017, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (https: //www. cdc. gov/mmwr) . Preliminary estimates of U. S. drug overdose deaths exceeded 60, 000 in 2016 and were partially driven by a fivefold increase in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (excluding methadone), from 3, 105 in 2013 to approximately 20, 000 in 2016 (1, 2) . Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50100 times more potent than morphine, is primarily responsible for this rapid increase (3, 4) . In addition, fentanyl analogs such as acetylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and carfentanil are being detected increasingly in overdose deaths (5, 6) and the illicit opioid drug supply (7) . Carfentanil is estimated to be 10, 000 times more potent than morphine (8) . Estimates of the potency of acetylfentanyl and furanylfentanyl vary but suggest that they are less potent than fentanyl (9) . Estimates of relative potency have some uncertainty because illicit fentanyl analog potency has not been evaluated in humans. This report describes opioid overdose deaths during JulyDecember 2016 that tested positive for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or U-47700, an illicit synthetic opioid, in 10 states participating in CDCs Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) program. * Fentanyl analogs are similar in chemical structure to fentanyl but not routinely detected because specialized toxicology testing is required. Fentanyl was detected in at least half of opioid overdose deaths in seven of 10 states, and 57% of fentanyl-involved deaths also tested positive for other illicit drugs, such as heroin. Fentanyl analogs were present in >10% of opioid overdose deaths in four states, with carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl identified most frequently. Expanded surveillance for opioid overdoses, including testing for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, assists in tracking the rapidly changing illicit opioid market and informing innovative interventions designed to reduce opioid overdose deaths. The 10 states  reporting data abstracted information from preliminary death certificates and medical examiner/coroner reports on unintentional and undetermined opioid overdose * CDC s Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance program funded 12 states through a competitive application process in fiscal year 2016. Data were available for this report for 10 of the 12 states. https: //www. cdc. gov/drugoverdose/foa/ state-opioid-mm. html.  M aine, Massachusetts, Missouri (data available for 22 counties), New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsindeaths using standard definitions for variables. Data were entered into the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS), the component of ESOOS designed for tracking fatal opioid overdoses.  For each death, available data on demographic characteristics, circumstances of the overdose collected from death scene investigations (e. g. , evidence of illicit drug use), and results of forensic toxicology testing were entered into SUDORS. Opioid overdose deaths occurring dur - ing JulyDecember 2016 with positive test results for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and U-47700 in 10 states are described, and key demographic and overdose circumstance factors are stratified by substance. Full toxicology findings of decedents were reviewed, including the presence of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Because heroin involvement in overdose deaths is difficult to distinguish from prescription morphine, deaths in which heroin was confirmed by toxicologic findings were combined with deaths in which heroin was suspected because morphine was detected and death scene evidence suggested heroin use.  The use of medical examiner/coroner reports, previously unavailable across states, provides unique insights into specific substances and circumstances associated with overdoses, which can inform interventions. Fentanyl was detected in 56. 3% of 5, 152 opioid overdose deaths in the 10 states during JulyDecember 2016 (Figure) . Among these 2, 903 fentanyl-positive deaths, fentanyl was determined to be a cause of death by the medical examiner or  S tate Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) estimates of opioid-involved overdose deaths might differ from those of the National Vital Statistics System because SUDORS uses preliminary death certificate data and collects additional information from medical examiner and coroner reports, which are abstracted within 8 months of death. In SUDORS, an opioid-involved overdose death either was identified through review of the medical examiner/coroner report or had International Classification of Disease, T enth Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X4044 (unintentional) or Y10Y14 (undetermined) and multiple cause-of-death codes T40. 0, T40. 1, T40. 2, T40. 3, T40. 4, or T40. 6 on the death certificate. Data for this report were downloaded on September 5, 2017.  A confirmed her oin death is defined as a death that tested positive for the heroin metabolite 6-acetylmorphine. The heroin metabolite 6-acetylmorphine, however, rapidly metabolizes to morphine, and thus a death involving heroin might only test positive for morphine, which is also present in deaths involving prescription morphine. A suspected heroin death is one in which testing for morphine is positive and the decedent also has a history of heroin use or death scene evidence indicating illicit drug use or injection in the absence of any evidence of prescription drug use or use of prescription morphine. https: //www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/25041514.

Northeastern states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island) and Missouri** reported the highest percentages of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl (approximately 60%90%), followed by Midwestern and Southern states (Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), where approximately 30%55% of decedents tested positive for fentanyl. New Mexico and Oklahoma reported the lowest percentage of fentanyl-involved deaths (approximately 15%25%) . In contrast, states detecting any fentanyl analogs in >10% of opioid overdose deaths were spread across the Northeast (Maine, 28. 6%, New Hampshire, 12. 2%), Midwest (Ohio, 26. 0%), and South (West Virginia, 20. 1%) (Figure) (Table 1) . Fentanyl analogs were present in 720 (14. 0%) opioid over - dose deaths, with the most common being carfentanil (389 deaths, 7. 6%), furanylfentanyl (182, 3. 5%), and acetylfen - tanyl (147, 2. 9%) (Table 1) . Fentanyl analogs contributed to death in 535 of the 573 (93. 4%) decedents. Cause of death was not available for fentanyl analogs in 147 deaths.  Five or more deaths involving carfentanil occurred in two states (Ohio and West Virginia), furanylfentanyl in five states (Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), and acetylfentanyl in seven states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) . U-47700 was present in 0. 8% of deaths and found in five or more deaths only in Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (Table 1) . Demographic characteristics of decedents were similar among overdose deaths involving fentanyl analogs and fentanyl (Table 2) . Most were male (71. 7% fentanyl and 72. 2% fentanyl analogs), non-Hispanic white (81. 3% fentanyl and 83. 6% fentanyl analogs), and aged 2544 years (58. 4% fentanyl and 60. 0% fentanyl analogs) (Table 2) . Other illicit drugs co-occurred in 57. 0% and 51. 3% of deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, respectively, with cocaine and confirmed or suspected heroin detected in a substantial percentage of deaths (Table 2) . Nearly half (45. 8%) of deaths involving fentanyl analogs tested positive for two or more analogs or fentanyl, or both. Specifically, 30. 9%, 51. 1%, and 97. 3% of deaths involving carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl, respectively, tested positive for fentanyl or additional fentanyl analogs. Forensic investigations found evidence of injection drug use in 46. 8% and 42. 1% of overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, respectively. Approximately one in five deaths involving fentanyl and fen - tanyl analogs had no evidence of injection drug use but did have evidence of other routes of administration. Among these deaths, snorting (52. 4% fentanyl and 68. 8% fentanyl analogs) and ingestion (38. 2% fentanyl and 29. 7% fentanyl analogs) were most common. Although rare, transdermal administration was found among deaths involving fentanyl (1. 2%), likely indicating pharmaceutical fentanyl (Table 2) . More than one third of deaths had no evidence of route of administration. * * I llicitly manufactured fentanyl is more easily mixed with white powder heroin, which is primarily sold east of the Mississippi River, than with black tar heroin. Although white powder heroin dominates the heroin market in the Northeast, the heroin market in Missouri includes both white powder heroin and black tar heroin. This might, in part, explain the high percentage of fentanyl overdoses documented in the state.

Discussion This analysis of opioid overdose deaths in 10 states partici - pating in the ESOOS program found that illicitly manufactured fentanyl is a key factor driving opioid overdose deaths and that fentanyl analogs are increasingly contributing to a complex illicit opioid market with significant public health implications. Previous reports have indicated that use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl mixed with heroin, with and without users knowledge, is driving many fentanyl overdoses, particu - larly east of the Mississippi River (3, 4) . Consistent with these findings, at least half of opioid overdose deaths in six of the seven participating states east of the Mississippi tested positive for fentanyl. Over half the overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs tested positive for confirmed or sus - pected heroin (the most commonly detected illicit substance), cocaine, or methamphetamine. This supports findings from other reports indicating that fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are commonly used with or mixed with heroin or cocaine (3, 4) . Nearly half of overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, however, did not test positive for other illicit opioids, suggesting that fentanyl and fentanyl analogs might be emerg - ing as unique illicit products. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are highly potent and fast-acting synthetic compounds that can trigger rapid progression to loss of consciousness and death and thus might require immediate treatment and high doses of naloxone (5) . Because of the potency of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs and the rapid onset of action, these drugs were determined by medical examiners and coroners to play a causal role in almost all fatal opioid overdoses in which they were detected. Injection, the most commonly reported route of administration in fatal overdoses, exacerbates these risks because of rapid absorption and high bioavailability. The high potency of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, however, can result in overdose even when administered via other routes. Nearly one in five deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs had evidence of snorting, ingestion, or smoking, with no evidence of injection. Multiple overdose outbreaks and law enforcement drug product submissions across the country have reported counterfeit prescription pills laced with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (10) . With few exceptions, fentanyl analogs are illicitly manufac - tured, because they do not have a legitimate medical use in humans.  The detection of fentanyl analogs in >10% of opioid overdoses in four states raises the concern that fentanyl analogs have become a part of illicit opioid markets in multiple states. The fentanyl analogs most commonly detected were carfent - anil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl. Carfentanil, which is intended for sedation of large animals, is much more potent than fentanyl, whereas furanylfentanyl and acetylfentanyl are less potent (9) . Carfentanil contributed to approximately 350 overdose deaths in Ohio, but was detected in only one other state (West Virginia) . Because of its extreme potency, even limited circulation of carfentanil could markedly increase the number of fatal overdoses. Recent data suggest that carfen - tanil deaths are occurring in multiple other states, including Kentucky, which reported 10 overdose deaths involving carfen - tanil in the second half of 2016 (Kentucky Department of Public Health, unpublished data, 2017) and New Hampshire, which reported 10 deaths in 2017.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 1201 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSUDORS opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl analogs tested positive for fentanyl or an additional fentanyl analog, ranging from 31% for carfentanil to 97% for acetylfentanyl. The increased mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and varying fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased risk for overdose because persons misusing opioids and other drugs are exposed to drug products with substantially varied potency. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, results are limited to 10 states and therefore might not be generalizable. Second, the presence of fentanyl analogs is underestimated because commonly used toxicologic testing does not include fentanyl analogs, some fentanyl analogs are difficult to detect (9), and specialized testing for fentanyl analogs varied across states and over time. Third, the route of fentanyl and fentanyl analog administration must be interpreted cautiously because the data do not link specific drugs to routes of administration and thus the precise route of administration of fentanyl or fentanyl analogs cannot be determined in overdose deaths involving multiple substances (e. g. , heroin and cocaine) and routes (e. g. , injection and snorting) . Fourth, the combination of deaths with toxicologic confirmation of heroin with those with detection of morphine and death scene evidence suggesting heroin use might have resulted in misclassification of some deaths. Finally, fentanyl source could not be definitively determined; however, only a small percentage of fentanyl deaths had evidence consistent with prescription fentanyl (e. g. , transdermal use versus injection) . Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is now a major driver of opioid overdose deaths in multiple states, with a variety of fentanyl analogs increasingly involved, if not solely implicated, in these deaths. This finding raises concern that in the near future, fentanyl analog overdose deaths might mirror the rapidly rising trajectory of fentanyl overdose deaths that began in 2013 and become a major factor in opioid overdose deaths. In response to this concern, CDC expanded ESOOS to 32 states and the District of Columbia in 2017 and added funding for all 33 recipients to improve forensic toxicologic testing of opioid overdose deaths to include capacity to test for a wider range of fentanyl analogs. *** Increased implementation of evidence-based efforts targeting persons at high risk for illicit opioid use, including increased access to medication-assisted treatment, increased availability of naloxone in sufficient doses, and other innovative intervention programs targeting this group, is needed to address a large and growing percentage of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. *** https: //www. cdc. gov/drugoverdose/foa/state-opioid-mm. html. Summary What is already known about this topic? Sharp increases in opioid overdose deaths since 2013 are partly explained by the introduction of illicitly manufactured fentanyl into the heroin market. Outbreaks related to fentanyl analogs also have occurred. One fentanyl analog, carfentanil, is esti-mated to be 10, 000 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl analogs are not routinely detected because specialized toxicology testing is required. What is added by this report? This is the first report using toxicologic and death scene evidence across multiple states to characterize opioid overdose deaths. Fentanyl was involved in >50% of opioid overdose deaths, and >50% of deaths testing positive for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs also tested positive for other illicit drugs. Approximately 700 deaths tested positive for fentanyl analogs, with the most common being carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl. What are the implications for public health practice? Increasing mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased overdose risk, because users are exposed to drug products that vary substan - tially in potency and that include some extremely potent products. Surveillance for opioid overdoses needs to expand to track the rapidly changing illicit opioid market. In fall 2017, CDC funded 33 jurisdictions to expand forensic toxicology testing. Increased implementation of evidence-based efforts targeting persons at high risk for using illicit opioids, including increased access to medication-assisted treatment and increased availabil - ity of naloxone, and innovative interventions are needed.

Physical Activity: Interventions Including Activity Monitors for Adults with Overweight or Obesity is available at https: // www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/physical-activity-inter - ventions-including-activity-monitors-adults-overweight-obesity. Established in 1996 by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, the CPSTF is an independent, nonfederal panel of public health and prevention experts whose members are appointed by the director of CDC. The CPSTF provides information for a wide range of persons who make decisions about programs, services, and other interventions to improve population health. Although CDC provides administrative, scientific, and technical support for the CPSTF, the recom - mendations developed are those of the task force and do not undergo review or approval by CDC. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1204 MMWR / November 3, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 43 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNotice to Readers New Web Location for Weekly and Annual NNDSS Data To improve the usability, availability, quality, and timeli - ness of surveillance data as part of the CDC Surveillance Strategy (1), CDC will provide users a convenient way to access notifiable infectious and noninfectious disease data through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) website. CDC has redesigned the data and statistics section of the NNDSS website to be a one-stop shop for users to find both detailed information about the notifiable disease data and links to the weekly and annual data. Although these data will no longer be published in their current format in MMWR, users can easily access the information on the NNDSS website. To ease the transition, MMWR also will link users from its website to the new location on the NNDSS website. Weekly Reporting CDC expects to transition the reporting of NNDSS weekly data in January 2018. The redesigned NNDSS Data and Statistics website at https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nndss/data-andstatistics. html will contain links to infectious disease data tables that are available in HTML, text, and PDF formats and hosted on the CDC WONDER platform (2) . The figure comparing selected notifiable diseases with historical data from the current MMWR weekly also will be available. In addition, the website will provide NNDSS documentation, including how the data are collected and reported, publication criteria, notes about interpreting data, and the list of notifiable conditions by year. Annual Reporting CDC is transitioning the reporting of NNDSS annual data on November 3, 2017. The NNDSS Data and Statistics website is available at https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nndss/data-andstatistics. html and includes links to infectious disease data tables that are available in HTML, text, and PDF formats and hosted on the CDC WONDER platform. The website also provides links to noninfectious conditions and disease outbreak surveillance reports published by CDC programs and hosted on the CDC WONDER platform. In addition, the website provides the following resources: documentation for NNDSS infectious diseases and noninfectious conditions and disease outbreaks, including how the data are collected, reported, and finalized; publication criteria; notes about interpreting data; and the list of notifiable conditions by year. Consolidating the notifiable disease data on the NNDSS website is part of the NNDSS Modernization Initiative (NMI) strategy to streamline NNDSS and access to data for users; NMI is a component of the CDC Surveillance Strategy. This consolidation of information also is in response to the recom - mendations of a CDC-wide workgroup, consisting of representatives from the CDC Excellence in Science Committee, the Surveillance Science Advisory Group, and MMWR, to make more data available online and to allow MMWR to focus on publishing scientific and actionable surveillance reports.

Estimates are age-adjusted to the projected 2000 U. S. population as the standard population using three age groups: 4549, 5064, and 65 years.  Based on a positiv e response to the survey question, Are you/Is anyone in the family limited in any way because of difficulty remembering or because you/they experience periods of confusion? Responses may be self-reported or reported by a knowledgeable family member. Information is obtained on each family member with the condition/limitation and included in the estimate of total prevalence.  C ategories shown are for Hispanic adults, who may be of any race or combination of races, and non-Hispanic adults who selected one racial group. Not all race groups are shown. Total bar is based on all adults aged 45 years.  Estimates are based on household interviews of a sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U. S. population and are derived from the National Health Interview Survey Family Component. Overall, 5. 1% of adults aged 45 years were limited in any way because of difficulty remembering or periods of confusion. The percentage of adults experiencing this limitation was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native adults (9. 8%) and non-Hispanic black adults (7. 4%), followed by Hispanic adults (5. 6%), non-Hispanic white adults (4. 7%), and non-Hispanic Asian adults (4. 1%) .
