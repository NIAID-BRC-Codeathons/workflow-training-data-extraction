U. S. Department of Health and Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control and PreventionPrevalence of Obesity Among Adults, by Household Income and Education  United States, 20112014 Cynthia L. Ogden, PhD1; Tala H. Fakhouri, PhD1; Margaret D. Carroll, MSPH1; Craig M. Hales, MD1; Cheryl D. Fryar, MSPH1; Xianfen Li, MS2; David S. Freedman, PhD3 Studies have suggested that obesity prevalence varies by income and educational level, although patterns might differ between high-income and low-income countries (13) . Previous analyses of U. S. data have shown that the prevalence of obesity varied by income and education, but results were not consistent by sex and race/Hispanic origin (4) . Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), CDC analyzed obesity prevalence among adults (aged 20 years) by three levels of household income, based on percentage (130%, >130% to 350%, and >350%) of the federal poverty level (FPL) and individual education level (high school graduate or less, some college, and college graduate) . During 20112014, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults was lower in the highest income group (31. 2%) than the other groups (40. 8% [>130% to 350%] and 39. 0% [130%]) . The age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among college graduates was lower (27. 8%) than among those with some college (40. 6%) and those who were high school graduates or less (40. 0%) . The patterns were not consistent across all sex and racial/Hispanic origin subgroups. Continued progress is needed to achieve the Healthy People 2020 targets of reducing age-adjusted obesity prevalence to <30. 5% and reducing disparities (5) . NHANES is a biannual cross-sectional survey designed to monitor the health and nutritional status of the civilian non - institutionalized U. S. population (6) . The survey consists of in-home interviews and standardized physical examinations conducted in mobile examination centers. During the physi-cal examination, standardized measurements of weight and height were obtained. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Obesity was defined as a BMI 30 kg/m 2. The NHANES sample is selected through a complex, multistage probability design. Participants self-reported race/Hispanic origin, and were divided into five categories: non-Hispanic white, nonHispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic and other. During 20112014, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic persons, among other groups, were oversampled. A total of 308 non-Hispanic persons reporting other races or more than one race were placed in an other category, and their data were included in the overall results. The NHANES examination response rate for adults aged 20 years was 64. 5% in the 20112012 survey and 63. 7% in the 20132014 survey. Household income was categorized using FPL information, which accounts for inflation and family size (https: //aspe. hhs. gov/prior-hhs-poverty-guidelines-and-federal-registerreferences); income levels were designated as 130%, >130% Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report1370 MMWR / December 22, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 50 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe MMWR series of publications is published by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.

The cut point for participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is 130% of the poverty level, and 350% provides relatively equal sample sizes for each of the three income groups. Education was categorized as high school graduate or less, some college, and college graduate. All estimates were adjusted to account for the complex survey design, including examination sample weights. Estimates were age-adjusted to the 2000 projected U. S. Census population using the age groups 2039, 4059, and 60 years. Confidence intervals for estimates were calculated using the Wald method. Differences between income and education groups were tested using a two-sided, univariate t-statistic, with statistical sig - nificance defined as a p-value of <0. 05. Temporal trends from 19992002 to 20112014 were analyzed using orthogonal contrasts and 2-year survey cycles. Pregnant women (122) and participants with missing weight or height (571) were excluded, resulting in a total sample size of 10, 636 for the period 20112014. For estimates by FPL, an additional 851 participants were excluded because of missing FPL data, and for estimates by education, eight participants were excluded because information on education was missing. During 20112014, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 38. 3% among women and 34. 3% among men (Table) . The prevalence of obesity was 34. 5% among non-Hispanic white adults, 48. 1% among non-Hispanic black adults, 11. 7% among non-Hispanic Asian adults, and 42. 5% among Hispanic adults. Among women, prevalence was lower in the highest income group (29. 7%) than in the middle (42. 9%) and lowest (45. 2%) income groups. This pattern was observed among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic women, but it was only significant for white women. Among non-Hispanic black women, there was no difference in obesity prevalence among the income groups. Among men, the prevalence of obesity was lower in both the lowest (31. 5%) and highest (32. 6%) income groups compared with the middle-income group (38. 5%) . This pattern was seen among both non-Hispanic white and Hispanic men, although among non-Hispanic white men, the difference between the highest-income and middle-income groups was not statistically significant. Among non-Hispanic black men, obesity prevalence was higher in the highest income group (42. 7%) than in the lowest income group (33. 8%) . There was no difference in obesity prevalence by income among non-Hispanic Asian men. In 20112014, the prevalence of obesity was lower among women and men who were college graduates (27. 8% [women], 27. 9% [men]) than among women and men with some col - lege (41. 2%, 40. 0%) and women and men who were high school graduates or less (45. 3%, 35. 5%) . By race/Hispanic origin, the same pattern was seen among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women, and also among non-Hispanic white men, although the differences were not all statistically significant. Although the difference was not statistically significant among non-Hispanic black men, obe-sity prevalence increased with educational attainment.

From 19992002 to 20112014 the prevalence of obesity increased among women in the two lower income groups, but not among women living in households with incomes above 350% of FPL. Obesity prevalence increased among men in all three income groups during this period (Figure 1) . Obesity prevalence also increased among both women and men in all education groups except men who were college graduates (Figure 2) . Discussion During 20112014, the relationships between obesity and income, and obesity and education were complex, differing among population subgroups. Whereas overall obesity prevalence decreased with increased levels of income and educational attainment among women, the association was more complex among men. Similar to results based on data from 20052008 (4), during 20112014, obesity prevalence was lower in the highest income group among women, but this was not the case among men. In fact, among non-Hispanic black men the prevalence of obesity was higher in the highest income group than in the lowest income group. Both women and men who were college graduates, on the other hand, had lower prevalences of obesity than did persons with less education. In general, prevalence of obesity among women was low - est among college graduates, although among non-Hispanic Asians there was no difference in prevalence by level of educa - tion. This relationship was not seen when obesity was examined by income level. For example, obesity prevalence was lower in the highest income group among non-Hispanic white women, but among non-Hispanic black women, prevalence did not differ between the highest and lowest household income groups. In contrast, among both non-Hispanic black women and non-Hispanic white women, the prevalence of obesity was lower among college graduates than among women with some college.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / December 22, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 50 1373 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionincome and obesity and education has been reported in at least one other study (7) in children. These findings demonstrate that lower levels of income and education are not universally associated with obesity; the association is complex and differs by sex and race/Hispanic origin. This is the first report to describe differences in obesity preva - lence by income and education among non-Hispanic Asian adults. There were no significant differences in prevalence by income or education among either non-Hispanic Asian women or men; however, there was a pattern of decreasing prevalence with increasing income among non-Hispanic Asian women. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limi - tations. First, BMI is a proxy for body fat and BMI 30 was applied to persons in all racial/Hispanic origin groups, which might result in underestimating health risks for certain popu - lations. For example, it has been suggested that the BMI cut point (30 kg/m 2) that typically defines obesity might be too high for Asians and underestimate associated health risks (8, 9) . Second, the small sample size among some subgroups reduced the ability to detect differences when differences exist. Additional years of data might provide more information about obesity prevalence by income, especially among non-Hispanic Asian women. T rends in obesity prevalence over time show that differences by income and education have existed at least since 19992002 among women. Among men, college graduates have consis - tently had a lower prevalence of obesity, whereas differences by household income have been less consistent. Further study is needed to understand the reasons for the different patterns by sex and race/Hispanic origin in the relationship between obesity and income or education.

Summary What is already known about this topic? Studies have suggested that obesity prevalence varies by income or education, although patterns might differ in high and low income countries. What is added by this report? Analysis of data from the 20112014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examining the association between obesity and education and obesity and income among U. S. adults demonstrate that obesity prevalence patterns by income vary between women and men and by race/Hispanic origin. The prevalence of obesity decreased with increasing income in women (from 45. 2% to 29. 7%), but there was no difference in obesity prevalence between the lowest (31. 5%) and highest (32. 6%) income groups among men. Moreover, obesity prevalence was lower among college graduates than among persons with less education for non-Hispanic white women and men, non-Hispanic black women, and Hispanic women, but not for non-Hispanic Asian women and men or non-Hispanic black or Hispanic men. The association between obesity and income or educational level is complex and differs by sex, and race/non-Hispanic origin. What are the implications for public health practice? NHANES will continue to be an important source of data on disparities in obesity prevalence. These data will help track the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing obesity disparities and might inform CDC, state, or local obesity prevention programs. 4.

Armour, PhD1; Corinne M. Graffunder, DRPH1; Bridgette E. Garrett, PhD1; Israel T. Agaku, DMD, PhD1 An overarching goal of Healthy People 2020 is to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve health among all groups. * Although significant progress has been made in reducing overall commercial tobacco product use, disparities persist, with American Indians or Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) hav - ing one of the highest prevalences of cigarette smoking among all racial/ethnic groups (1, 2) . Variations in cigarette smoking among AI/ANs have been documented by sex and geographic location (3), but not by other sociodemographic characteristics. Furthermore, few data exist on use of tobacco products other than cigarettes among AI/ANs (4) . CDC analyzed self-reported current (past 30-day) use of five tobacco product types among AI/AN adults from the 20102015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); results were compared with six other racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic; non-Hispanic white [white]; non-Hispanic black [black]; non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander [NHOPI]; non-Hispanic Asian [Asian]; and non-Hispanic multirace [multirace]) . Prevalence of current tobacco product use was significantly higher among AI/ANs than among non-AI/ANs combined for any tobacco product, cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, pipes, and smokeless tobacco. Among AI/ANs, prevalence of current use of any tobacco product was higher among males, persons aged 1825 years, those with less than a high school diploma, those with annual family income <$20, 000, those who lived below the federal poverty level, and those who were never married. Addressing the social determinants of health and providing evidence-based, population-level, and culturally appropriate tobacco control interventions could help reduce tobacco product use and eliminate disparities in tobacco prod - uct use among AI/ANs (1) . NSDUH is an annual, national survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U. S. population aged 12 years (4) . The analyses in this report were restricted to persons aged 18 years. Because of the limited sample size of AI/ANs, data were pooled across six NSDUH waves (20102015) to increase precision of estimates; pooled sample sizes were 3, 655 for AI/AN adults and 235, 262 for non-AI/AN adults.

The AI/AN popula - tion included persons who identified AI/AN as their only race/ethnicity on the survey. Non-AI/AN populations comprised whites; blacks; NHOPIs; Asians; multiracial persons; and Hispanics. Current tobacco product use was defined as past 30-day use of the following tobacco products: cigarettes; cigars (big cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars); roll-your-own tobacco; pipes; and smokeless tobacco (chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, and snus) .  Current users of any tobacco product** were persons who reported past 30-day use of one or more of the assessed tobacco product types. Data were weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to yield nationally representative estimates. Prevalence was calculated overall and by sex, age group (1825 years, 2634 years, 3549 years, and 50 years), education (less than a high school diploma, high school graduate, some college, college gradu - ate), annual family income (<$20, 000, $20, 000$49, 999, $50, 000$74, 999, and $75, 000), poverty,  and marital status; prevalence estimates with relative standard errors 30% were suppressed. Non-AI/AN adults were used as comparison groups, both as a single combined group comprising the six other racial/ethnic groups and as individual racial/ethnic groups. Among AI/ANs, disparities in tobacco product use within sociodemographic subgroups were calculated using prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals, with the group with the lowest prevalence of any tobacco use serving as the referent. Statistical comparisons were performed with Chi-square tests, with statistical significance defined as p<0. 05. During 20102015, prevalence among AI/ANs was sig - nificantly higher than that among non-AI/ANs combined for current use of any tobacco product (43. 3% versus 27. 7%, respectively); cigarettes (37. 3% versus 23. 0%); roll-your-own tobacco (7. 1% versus 3. 5%), pipes (1. 9% versus 0. 9%) and smokeless tobacco (6. 6% versus 3. 5%) (Table 1) .

For current cigar smoking prevalence, a significant difference between AI/ANs and non-AI/ANs combined was seen among persons aged 3549 years. Current use prevalence of roll-your-own tobacco was significantly higher among AI/ANs, compared with their combined non-AI/AN counterparts, for all sub - groups except persons with less than a high school diploma; liv - ing in poverty; and widowed, divorced, or separated. Compared with their combined non-AI/AN counterparts, current pipe smoking prevalence was significantly higher among AI/AN males, as well as among persons aged 3549 years; those with annual family income <$20, 000; living in poverty; and who were never married (all p<0. 05) . Among AI/ANs, the prevalence of current use of any tobacco product was 1. 31 times higher among males than among females (Table 2) . Compared with prevalence among persons aged 50 years, prevalence was higher among those aged 3449 years (PR = 1. 68); 2634 years (PR = 1. 79); and 1825 years (PR = 1. 88) . By education attainment, prevalence was higher among persons with some college (PR = 2. 07); a high school diploma (PR = 2. 16); and less than a high school diploma (PR = 2. 37) than among those with at least a college degree. Compared with prevalence among persons with annual family income $75, 000, prevalence was 1. 55 times higher among those earning <$20, 000. By poverty status, prevalence was higher among persons living at up to twice the federal poverty threshold (PR = 1. 21) and in poverty (PR = 1. 43) than among those living at more than twice the federal poverty threshold. Compared with those who were married, prevalence was 1. 33 times higher among persons who were never married (all p<0. 05) . AI/ANs had higher prevalence of any tobacco product use and cigarette smoking than any other individual racial/ethnic group (Figure) . Prevalence of cigar smoking among AI/ANs was lower than among blacks, but higher than among Hispanics and Asians. Prevalence of roll-your-own tobacco and pipe use among AI/ANs was higher than among whites, blacks, Asians and Hispanics, and prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among AI/ANs was significantly higher than prevalence among all other racial/ethnic groups, with the exception of NHOPIs (all p<0. 05) .

Discussion During 20102015, the prevalence of current use of any tobacco product was significantly higher among AI/ANs than among non-AI/ANs, overall and among all assessed subgroups, except persons with at least a college degree. Among AI/ANs, the greatest disparity was associated with level of education: prevalence of any tobacco product use was 2. 37 times higher among persons with less than high school diploma than among those with a college degree or higher. Socioeconomic status has a strong, inverse relationship with tobacco product use (5) . Given that a higher percentage of AI/ANs live in poverty than do non-AI/ANs (28. 4% versus 15. 3% nationally) or have less than a high school education (23% versus 14% nationally),  addressing inequalities in education and poverty among AI/ANs might help reduce the high burden of tobacco product use among this population. Additional research is needed to identify the role of other factors (e. g. , cultural, environmental, social) that might explain some of the observed differences. Some American Indian tribes have long used traditional tobacco in cultural ceremonies of medicinal and spiritual importance (6) . However, evidence suggests that commer - cial tobacco products, such as cigarettes and packaged loose  https: //www. census. gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_ special_editions/cb11-ff22. html.

In addition, tobacco products are less expen - sive on tribal lands, which might increase tobacco access and consumption (8) . The tobacco industry has also been shown to target AI/ANs by marketing of cigarette brands with cultural icons, names, and symbols belonging exclusively to AI/ANs (9) . The equitable implementation of evidence-based tobacco control interventions, such as comprehensive smoke-free policies, is important to reduce tobacco product use among AI/ANs. CDC has implemented population-level strategies to help reduce disparities among AI/ANs, including Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country, an initiative that works to reduce commercial tobacco product use, while improving nutrition, physical activity, health literacy, and communityclinical linkages for AI/AN populations.  Moreover, CDCs  https: //www. cdc. gov/chronicdisease/tribal/factsheet. htm. Summary What is already known about this topic? Whereas significant progress has been made in reducing overall commercial tobacco product use, disparities persist, with American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) having one of the highest cigarette smoking prevalences of all racial/ethnic groups. What is added by this report? Prevalence of current tobacco product use was significantly higher among AI/ANs than among non-AI/ANs for any tobacco product (43. 3% versus 27. 7%), cigarettes (37. 3% versus 23. 0%), roll-your-own tobacco (7. 1% versus 3. 5%), pipes (1. 9% versus 0. 9%), and smokeless tobacco (6. 6% versus 3. 5%) . Among AI/ANs, prevalence of current use of any tobacco product was higher among males (49. 7%), persons aged 1825 years (55. 6%), persons with less than a high school diploma (49. 8%), persons with annual family income <$20, 000 (50. 3%), persons who lived below the poverty level (51. 3%), and those who never married (50. 5%) . What are the implications for public health practice? Addressing the social determinants of health and providing evidence-based, population-level, and culturally appropriate tobacco control interventions could help reduce tobacco product use and disparities in tobacco product use among AI/ANs. Such interventions could include engaging native community leaders and fostering respect for traditional/ceremonial use of tobacco as a reason for not using tobacco recreationally. Tips From Former Smokers tobacco education campaign uses culturally appropriate mass media campaigns to warn about the health risks of smoking. Some of this work is tailored toward racial/ethnic minorities, including AI/ANs. *** Reducing dis - parities in use of tobacco products will require focusing more attention on populations carrying a disproportionate burden of tobacco product use and dependence, and increasing reach to such groups through efforts that directly affect the scope of services and facilities serving those populations. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, tobacco product use and other sociodemographic characteristics were self-reported and subject to recall and social desirability bias. Second, small sample sizes resulted in imprecise estimates that could not be reported for some sociodemographic subgroups. Third, data were unavailable for certain tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes and hookahs. Finally, these analyses used data pooled across multiple years, and therefore, do not reflect possible secular trends in tobacco product use.

Kevin Horton, DrPH1; Edward J. Kasarskis, MD, PhD2; Ed Tessaro3; M. Shira Eisenberg4; Susan Laird5; John Iskander, MD4 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease, is a rapidly progressive fatal neurologic disease. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and the available treatments only extend life by an average of a few months. The majority of ALS patients die within 25 years of diagnosis, though survival time varies depending on disease progression (1, 2) . For approximately 10% of patients, ALS is familial, meaning it and has a genetic component; the remaining 90% have sporadic ALS, where etiology is unknown, but might be linked to environmental factors such as chemical exposures (e. g. , heavy metals, pesticides) and occupational history (3) . Like many other noncommunicable conditions, ALS is a nonnotifiable disease in the United States; therefore, the federal government lacks reliable incidence and prevalence estimates for the United States. During October 2008, Congress passed the ALS Registry Act (4), directing CDC and its sister agency, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, to cre - ate a population-based ALS registry for the United States. The main objectives of the National ALS Registry, which was launched in October 2010, are to describe the national incidence and prevalence of ALS; describe the demographics of persons living with ALS; and examine risk factors for the disease (4, 5) . During January 2017, the Registry launched the National ALS Biorepository, which aims to promote research in areas including biomarkers, genetics, and environmental exposures to heavy metals or organophosphates (6, 7) . ALS Registry and Biorepository Methods and Impact Because ALS is a nonnotifiable condition, the National ALS Registry uses a novel two-pronged approach for identifying cases in the United States (5) including searching national administrative databases and self-identification. The first approach applies a pilot-tested algorithm to large national databases (e. g. , Medicare, Veterans Health Administration) to identify cases (5, 8) . The algorithm helps classify indi - vidual persons as having actual, potential, or non-ALS cases This is another in a series of occasional MMWR reports titled CDC Grand Rounds. These reports are based on grand rounds presentations at CDC on high-profile issues in public health science, practice, and policy. Information about CDC Grand Rounds is available at https: //www. cdc. gov/about/grand-rounds. using variables including the International Classification of Diseases  Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic code for ALS, frequency of visits to neurologists, and use of prescription drugs (e. g. , Rilutek) (8) . Patients with ALS are added directly to the Registry, while those considered noncases are not. Potential ALS patients are not added to the Registry, but are retained until subsequent years of administrative data are available to be able to make a determination (8) . The second approach uses a secure web portal to allow persons with ALS to selfidentify (8) . ALS patients answer a series of online validation questions (e. g. , has a doctor ever diagnosed you with ALS?) . Their responses to these questions determine whether they are considered actual ALS cases (8) . In addition, this web portal approach allows ALS enrollees to take brief online risk factor surveys (e. g. , occupational history, residential history, history of head trauma) that will allow scientists to learn more about the possible causes of ALS (8) . Cases from both approaches are then merged and deduplicated so that cases are not counted multiple times (8) (Figure) . The National ALS Biorepository is part of the Registry; therefore, patients must enroll in the Registry to donate speci - mens (6) . The Registry conducted a multiyear pilot study to determine the feasibility of the Biorepository (6) . A group of external subject matter experts provided direction and deemed the Biorepository to be feasible, and it was launched in January 2017 (6) . The Biorepository has a geographically representative sample collection scheme, that is, not all samples will come from one part of country, but are distributed based on population density (7) . There are two components of the Biorepository: an in-home collection and a postmortem col - lection. The in-home collection consists of samples of blood, urine, and saliva from ALS patients, with an annual goal of 300 samples. The postmortem collection, consisting of samples of bone, brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, and muscle targets 10 collections each year. The preand postmortem collections will seek to expand knowledge on ALS biomarkers, genetics, and ultimately, etiology. The Biorepository is unique in that the samples collected are not previously used or left over from another study. In addition, these samples will be matched with the Registrys survey data as well as a Global Unique Identifier (for those patients who elect to have a global unique identifier generated), which will allow researchers to track the progress of patients in multiple studies securely and anonymously. When researchers request samples, they can receive, in addition to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1380 MMWR / December 22, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 50 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionFIGURE.

Lastly, the National ALS Biorepository will facilitate ALS research on etiologies and possible treatments. ALS Prevalence and Risk Factors In 2013, the most current year for which data are available, the Registry identified almost 16, 000 cases of ALS, corresponding to a prevalence of five cases per 100, 000 population in the United States (9) . As with any surveillance system for a disease that is nonnotifiable, it is impossible to capture all cases of ALS through the Registry. For example, there are currently no linkages to private insurance systems such as health mainte - nance organizations, where potential ALS patients might seek diagnosis or treatment. ALS disproportionately affects whites, males, and persons aged 6069 years (9); the reasons for the increased incidence among whites and males is unknown (9) . Military veterans, particularly men, are at higher risk for developing ALS than are those who have not served (10) . Veterans who served in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / December 22, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 50 1381 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthe first Gulf War were twice as likely to develop ALS as were veterans who served during the same period but were not deployed to the Gulf (11) . The reason for the increased risk among veterans is not known, but it might be related to selective environmental exposures (9, 10) . Participation by athletes in certain sports, specifically American football, has purportedly been associated with an increased risk of developing ALS; several high-profile diagnoses in professional football players have also brought increased attention to ALS (12) . Currently, it is unknown if football players might be at a greater risk for ALS than the general popu - lation; however, some research indicates it might be related to experiencing repeated concussions, or that ALS could be confused with a different condition such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (12) . More research is needed to investigate etiology of ALS and to learn more about the pathophysiology. ALS incidence is stable; however, the prevalence slowly continues to increase (13) . Proposed reasons for the increase in prevalence includes comprehensive health care that allows patients to live longer, and large ALS clinics that provide patients with neurologic and nursing care, dietary support, and physical therapy care in one setting (13) . However, not all ALS patients have access to large multidisciplinary ALS clinics, and those living in rural areas still tend to see their local primary care physician or neurologist (13, 14) . Challenges for Research, Drug Development, and Patient Care The onset of ALS is insidious. Patients might experience weakness in an upper or lower limb or difficulty speaking or swallowing, with bulbar onset disease. No definitive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or imaging biomarkers for ALS have been identified yet; thus, ALS is often a diagnosis of exclu - sion, typically made after other diseases have been ruled out (15) . As a result, approximately 912 months might elapse during the onset of new progressive weakness and a defini-tive diagnosis. This time window, essentially one quarter of an ALS patients remaining lifespan, is a lost opportunity for developing drugs aimed at stopping the degeneration and death of motor neurons. Researchers can measure and monitor ALS progression and the effectiveness of drugs in clinical trials using self-rating of function with the ALS Functional Rating Scale or quantitative measures of muscle power, including pulmonary function tests (e. g. , percentage of forced vital capacity, maximum inspiratory pressure, sniff nasal pressure), measurement of walking speed, and isometric muscle power (16) . However, disease progression varies widely among patients. Certain functions can remain nor - mal including bladder and bowel control, eye movements, and awareness (15) . Unlike other progressive neurologic conditions such as Alzheimers disease, cognition and largely memory remain intact for the vast majority of ALS patients; however, new research suggests that frontotemporal dementia may be affecting more ALS patients than previously thought (17) . Barriers to progress in identifying the etiology, means of prevention, and cure of ALS remain formidable. An estimated 50%70% of motor neurons are no longer functional when patients with clinical signs and symptoms come to medical attention (15) . Therefore, clinical trials that enroll ALS patients use drugs that can only attempt to slow disease progression. At this time, there are no identified therapeutics that stop or reverse the death of these motor neurons (15) . Other barriers include the large number of patients required for sufficiently powered clinical trials and the costs of trials. Living with ALS: A Patients Perspective A patient with ALS has written, ALS patients can have a zeal for life rare among patients with other diseases. Shorter life expectancy often spurs patient with ALS to make life experi - ences and relationships deeper. It is helpful to understand the concept that everyone has a wheel chair, and that no one avoids lifes crises forever. Organizations exist with the mission to defeat ALS through research, and provide support for the thousands of persons liv - ing with the disease in the United States. Such groups include the ALS Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Les T urner ALS Foundation. However, more support for research is needed. Even with continued support from private donors, foundations, and institutions, rare diseases (those with <200, 000 cases diagnosed nationwide) * like ALS still face barriers to research funding and treatment development. The financial consequences of ALS after diagnosis can also be crippling, and go well beyond typical loss of income (18) . Living with ALS becomes cost-prohibitive for a majority of patients (18) . Some accommodations, including home con - version; a power wheelchair; and a van with ramp, lifts, and tech-assist devices can cost from $100, 000 to $150, 000, adding considerable stress to families already dealing with the diagnosis (18) . The fear that family savings, retirement, mortgages, and educational funds are at risk, often provokes further health complications (18) . Development of a strong doctor-patient alliance can bal - ance honest, diagnostic, and prognostic communications with messages that promote purpose, hope, and quality of life for patients with ALS. After the diagnosis, there is a great need to counsel patients in an affirmative way to accept the reality of the disease. Currently, this type of family counseling is rarely included in the ALS multispecialty clinic setting. Much can * N ational Organization for Rare Disorders. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1382 MMWR / December 22, 2017 / V ol. 66 / No. 50 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionbe done to help patients cope and see firsthand the optimism of new research, clinical trial enrollment, technology-based solutions, and self-determination techniques. Reluctance to spend time discussing these positive aspects for fear of creating false hope might result in a missed therapeutic opportunity. The National ALS Registry as a Model for 21st Century Surveillance Whereas understanding the epidemiology of ALS is one of the main objectives of the National ALS Registry, the Registry also conducts other vital activities to help both patients and researchers learn more about the disease. The Registry funds external research to help the ALS com - munity learn more about potential ALS etiology and risk factors. To date, the Registry has funded 13 research projects including Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Studies of ALS, gene-environment interaction studies, antecedent medi - cal conditions, and environmental risk factors for ALS. Importantly, the Registry is used to recruit enrollees into clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. The Registry speeds up difficult and costly clinical trial recruitment time, increases study sample size, and helps achieve racial, ethnic, and geo - graphic diversity. The Registrys services are provided free to researchers (9) . To date, the Registry has helped scientists in the public and private sectors recruit hundreds of patients into over 30 research studies. The National ALS Registry is the first and only populationbased ALS registry for the United States that is quantifying the epidemiology of the disease (8) . The Registry is a critical tool in building the evidence to describe the ALS experience in the United States, provide epidemiologic data and biospecimens to scientists, and discover the etiology and risk factors for ALS.

S. Office of Population Affairs, 2017 Loretta Gavin, PhD1; Karen Pazol, PhD2; Katherine Ahrens, PhD1 In April 2014, CDC published Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the U. S. Office of Population Affairs (QFP), which describes the scope of services that should be offered in a family planning visit and how to provide those services (e. g. , periodicity of screening, which persons are in need of services, etc.) (1) . The sections in QFP include the following: Determining the Clients Need for Services; Contraceptive Services; Pregnancy Testing and Counseling; Clients Who Want to Become Pregnant; Basic Infertility Services; Preconception Health Services; Sexually T ransmitted Disease Services; and Related Preventive Health Services. In addition, the QFP includes an appendix entitled Screening Services for Which Evidence Does Not Support Screening. CDC and the Office of Population Affairs developed QFP recommendations by conducting an extensive review of pub - lished evidence, seeking expert opinion, and synthesizing existing clinical recommendations from CDC, agencies such as the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and professional med - ical associations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The scope of preventive services related to reproductive health is constantly evolving as new scientific findings are published and clinical recommendations are modified accord - ingly. Being knowledgeable about the most current recom - mendations is an important step toward providing the highest quality care to patients. To keep QFP current with the latest recommendations, CDC and the Office of Population Affairs publish occasional updates that summarize newly published clinical recommendations. The first of these updates was pub - lished in March 2016 (2), and covered guidelines published during April 2014December 2015. This report summarizes recommendations from guidelines published during January 2016April 2017. CDC and the Office of Population Affairs prepared these updates by searching for materials from CDC, USPSTF, and other professional medical organizations that had recommendations referenced in the original QFP. When updated recommendations were identified, they were evalu-ated for changes in implications for providing family planning care. CDC and the Office of Population Affairs determined that none of the newly published recommendations marked a substantial shift in how family planning care should be pro - vided, and therefore did not seek additional review to consider the implications for the QFP for this update. Technical reviews from clinical experts representing a broad range of family planning providers might be appropriate for future updates. Updated recommendations that have implications for clinical practice for family planning providers are highlighted (Box) . In addition, an updated reference list for each section in the QFP is provided for all recommendations published during January 2016April 2017, including those that did not result in any change in recommended clinical practices for family planning providers.

Selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use The 2016 CDC recommendations update earlier 2013 recommendations that address a select group of common, yet sometimes complex, issues regarding initiation and use of specific contraceptive methods. Recommendations have been updated regarding when to start regular contraception after UPA emergency contraceptive pills: A dvise the woman to start or resume hormonal contraception no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA, and provide or prescribe the regular contraceptive method as needed. For methods requiring a visit to a health care provider, such as depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs), starting the method at the time of UPA use may be considered; the risk that the regular contraceptive method might decrease the effectiveness of UPA must be weighed against the risk of not starting a regular hormonal contraceptive method.  The woman needs to abstain fr om sexual intercourse or use barrier contraception for the next 7 days after starting or resuming regular contraception or until her next menses, whichever comes first.  Any nonhormonal contraceptiv e method can be started immediately after the use of UPA. The woman should be advised to hav e a pregnancy test if she does not have a withdrawal bleed within 3 weeks. New recommendations have been made regarding medications used to ease IUD insertion: M isoprostol is not recommended for routine use before IUD insertion. Misoprostol might be helpful in select circumstances (e. g. , in women with a recent failed insertion) .  P aracervical block with lidocaine might reduce patient pain during IUD insertion.

In 2016, active TB disease was diagnosed in 11 residents and latent TB infection (LTBI) was diagnosed in six residents of facility A. Asynchronous VDOT was used to monitor treatment for these 17 residents. One of the patients with active TB disease had received a diagnosis of LTBI during an investigation at facility A during 20112012. During 20102012, seven residents of facility A received a diagnosis of active TB disease; four of these diagnoses were culture-confirmed, with isolates that had the same rare genotype (1) . Drug susceptibility testing indicated sensitiv - ity to the standard first-line regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) . Three of the seven TB patients died before starting treatment; the other four were prescribed the RIPE regimen under the supervision of personnel from facility A. T wo of the four patients who report-edly completed RIPE treatment in 2012 died in 2016 from unrecognized TB-related conditions; both patients were room - mates of the 2016 index case patient. For these two patients, evidence of TB discovered during a postmortem medical record review included ineffective antibiotic treatments for putative community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis and signs of wasting, which were corroborated by interviews with staff members and treating physician. No patients at facility A tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus infection in 2012 or 2016. The contact investigation performed in 20112012 identified LTBI in 26 residents and seven nonresidents. All contacts with LTBI were reported by facility staff members as having completed treatment with 4 months of daily rifampin (4R), one of a few standard LTBI regimens, in 2012. On June 20, 2016, a resident of facility A, who was a contact from the 20112012 investigation and whose facility records indicated prior treatment for LTBI with 4R, was identified as having advanced cavitary TB disease; the genotype and drug susceptibility testing of this patients isolate matched that of the original cases. This resident began treatment with a 6-month course of RIPE; ethambutol was discontinued after drug sensitivities were confirmed. Among 38 residents and 15 staff members, 10 additional cases of active TB disease were diagnosed among residents; these patients were prescribed rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (without ethambutol) . Six other residents with diagnosed LTBI were prescribed 4R treatment. Because of staffing shortages, Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) TB field personnel were not available to administer daily directly observed therapy (DOT) at facility A and facility A did not have the personnel needed to provide daily patient transport to the PRDH clinic. VDOT uses video and computer equipment that allows public health officials to observe patients taking medications for TB, and it has been successfully used to ensure proper completion of TB treatment (25) . A standard live VDOT protocol (e. g. , using FaceTime) (4) was attempted at facility A but was not sustainable because cell phones or Internet connec - tivity were not consistently available. An asynchronous VDOT protocol that did not require real-time Internet connection or a cellular plan, complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and provided a Spanish external-facing application*, was implemented to ensure proper treatment for TB and LTBI patients. Use of this asynchronous system avoided audio/visual interruption related to poor connectivity, which can be problematic in standard live VDOT applications (4), by capturing and storing videos of patients as they swal - lowed their TB medications, and automatically uploading the videos after Internet connection became available. Videos were viewed by PRDH staff members at 210 times the speed at which they were recorded. In addition to the clinic-to-facility commute, which would have taken 1. 5 hours per day, DOT for the 17 severely cognitively challenged men would have required an additional 1. 5 hours per day of observation. Use of asynchronous VDOT saved PRDH approximately 240 hours in DOT-related activities, equivalent to 25% of the workload for a full-time epidemiology technician/case manager over 6 months of treatment. As of July 12, 2017, all 11 patients with active TB disease and all six with LTBI had completed treatment with recom - mended 80% compliance (percentage of scheduled doses actually taken) (Table) (6) .

CDC r ecommends completion of 130-dose treatment during a 5 day/week regimen for active TB disease and compliance is recommended to be at least 80%. Doses taken were counted only during weeks in which 4 doses occurred (80% compliance) . For LTBI, CDC recommends completion of 120-dose Rifampin treatment during a 7 day/week regimen.

VDOT has been demonstrated to be cost-effective in multiple settings (5) . CDC has developed an eDOT toolkit (https: //www. cdc. gov/tb/publications/guidestoolkits/tbedottoolkit. htm) to facilitate adoption of these practices. Conflict of Interest Katrina Rios is an employee of a private company that licensed VDOT technology and allowed the Puerto Rico Department of Health to use the technology at no cost to address this outbreak.
