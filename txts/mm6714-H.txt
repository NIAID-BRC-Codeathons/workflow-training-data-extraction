U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCurrent Marijuana Use by Industry and Occupation  Colorado, 20142015 Roberta Smith, MSPH1; Katelyn E. Hall, MPH1; Paul Etkind, DrPH2; Mike Van Dyke, PhD1 The effects of marijuana use on workplace safety are of concern for public health and workplace safety professionals. T wenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws legalizing marijuana at the state level for recreational and/or medical purposes. Employers and safety professionals in states where marijuana use is legal have expressed concerns about potential increases in occupational injuries, such as on-the-job motor vehicle crashes, related to employee impair - ment. Data published in 2017 by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) showed that more than one in eight adult state residents aged 18 years currently used marijuana in 2014 (13. 6%) and 2015 (13. 4%) (1) . To examine current marijuana use by working adults and the industries and occupations in which they are employed, CDPHE analyzed data from the states Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) regarding current marijuana use (at least 1 day during the preceding 30 days) among 10, 169 persons who responded to the current marijuana use question. During 2014 and 2015, 14. 6% of these 10, 169 Colorado workers reported current marijuana use, with the highest reported prevalence among workers in the Accommodation and Food Services industry (30. 1%) and Food Preparation and Serving (32. 2%) occupations. Understanding the industries and occupations of adults with reported marijuana use can help direct and maximize impact of public health messaging and potential safety interventions for adults. The Colorado BRFSS is a CDC-sponsored, state-based, random-digitdialed telephone survey of the noninstitutional - ized U. S. population aged 18 years. The survey collects infor - mation on health risk factors, preventive health practices, and disease status (2) . In 2012, 2014, and 2015, two standardized employment questions were included in the Colorado BRFSS survey (3) . Respondents who indicated that their current employment status was employed for wages, self-employed, or out of work for less than 1 year were asked 1) What kind of business or industry do you work in? (industry classification), and 2) What is your job title? (occupation classification) . In 2014 and in 2015, questions that collected information on marijuana use during the past 30 days were added to the Colorado survey. Respondents who replied yes when asked if they had ever used marijuana or hashish were then asked how many days during the past 30 days they had used marijuana or hashish as well as subsequent questions on use frequency and methods. Current use of marijuana was defined as having used marijuana or hashish on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. Using the 2014 and 2015 BRFSS data combined, stateweighted percentages were calculated, and bivariate analyses using a Rao-Scott chi-square test were performed to compare the prevalence of marijuana use by age group, sex, and race/ ethnicity. In addition, prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare the prevalence of marijuana use by industry and occupation. Overall BRFSS industry and occupation data, representing current Colorado employment, were added to illustrate the percentage of employees working in the industries and occupations identified within the state.

Roper, MD, MPH William Schaffner, MDPercentages of employed persons reporting current marijuana use in the industry and occupation comparisons were ageadjusted based on the 2000 U. S. standard population. The overall response rate for the Colorado BRFSS was 57. 0% in 2014 and 55. 2% in 2015. Among the combined 26, 936 respondents* in the BRFSS 2014 and 2015 surveys, 18, 848 (70. 0%) were given the oppor - tunity to answer the question of whether they had ever used marijuana or hashish, and 18, 674 (99. 1%) responded (either positively or negatively) to the question. Of those respondents, 10, 169 (54. 5%) indicated that they were employed or had been out of work for less than 1 year. Among the 10, 169 workers responding, 14. 6% reported using marijuana during the pre - ceding 30 days (Table 1) . The prevalence of current marijuana use was higher among persons aged 1825 years (29. 6%) than among persons aged 2634 years (18. 6%) and persons aged 35 years (11. 0%), and higher among men (17. 2%) than among women (11. 3%) . By race/ethnicity, prevalence of cur - rent marijuana use was highest among non-Hispanic whites (15. 3%), followed by Hispanics (15. 1%) and non-Hispanic blacks (14. 5%) (Table 1) . Among the 10, 169 workers, the industry with the high - est prevalence of current marijuana use (30. 1%) was Accommodation and Food Services (Table 2) . Among occupa - tions, Food Preparation and Serving had the highest prevalence * Included adults who were students, retirees, and homemakers, in addition to those employed. of current marijuana users (32. 2%), although the age-adjusted prevalence was 19. 1% (Table 3) .

However, the prevalences of current marijuana use among workers in T ransportation and Material Moving (10. 3%) and Healthcare and Technical (3. 1%) were lower than the overall state prevalence (Table 3) Reported current use of marijuana was lower in industries that are known to perform routine drug testing on employees such as the Healthcare and Social Assistance (7. 4%); Utilities (5. 8%); and Mining, Oil, and Gas industries (5. 2%) (Table 2) . Current use also was lower than the overall state prevalence in T ransportation and Material Moving occupations (10. 2%), which are subject to federal drug testing requirement (Table 3) . Discussion This is the first study to use BRFSS data to describe selfreported current marijuana use among adults working in vari - ous industries and occupations. Although reported past-month marijuana use does not necessarily indicate use or impairment on the job, there is some evidence that marijuana use in general might increase the risk for nondriving workplace injuries (4) Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related TABLE 2.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 412 MMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventiondeaths in the United States (5), and studies have linked recent marijuana use to an increased risk for motor vehicle crashes (6, 7) . However, although marijuana negatively affects skills needed for safe driving, limitations related to roadside and toxicology testing, marijuana detection time, and co-use of substances contribute to uncertainty about risk. A 2006 study using 20002001 data from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse and the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that workers who were subject to frequent workplace drug testing and severe penalties were less likely to report past month marijuana use (8) . Because BRFSS is a public health survey, reporting marijuana use might be more representative of actual use by industry and occupation than if this information had been collected through an employersponsored survey. Analysis of age-adjusted prevalences among workers who acknowledged ever using marijuana or hashish highlighted the impact of younger workers in various industries and occupations on prevalence rates. In industries that tend to attract younger workers, such as food services, the marijuana use prevalence decreased with age-adjustment. For example, whereas the unadjusted prevalence of marijuana use among adults employed in Food Preparation and Serving occupations was 32. 2%, the age-adjusted prevalence was 19. 1%. Similarly, there were large differences in adjusted and unadjusted preva - lences in the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation industry, which might have a large proportion of younger workers. The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita - tions. First, data were collected from adults in Colorado who reported being employed at the time of the survey and might not be representative of all employed adults in Colorado. Second, among respondents to the marijuana question, not all responded to the question regarding which industry or occupation they were employed in or recorded an industry or occupation that could be coded to an existing industry or occupation. This resulted in missing data for the 10, 169 workers analyzed. Third, industry and occupation information were reported by respondents who were currently employed for wages, self-employed, or out of work for less than 1 year. A respondent might not have been actively working in the industry or occupation recorded, and that could influence the prevalence of marijuana use. Fourth, data are self-reported and thus are subject to the limitations for such survey data, including recall and response bias. Fifth, self-reported data might be subject to interviewer and recording errors leading to misclassification. These estimates might differ from other nationally representative behavior surveillance systems because of differences in survey methods, survey type, and topic. Finally, current use of marijuana was defined as having used marijuana or hashish on at least 1 day in the past 30 days. An employee who uses marijuana every day versus one that uses only once a month might present different considerations for impairment in a workplace. It is also important to note that these data do not directly measure working under the influ - ence of marijuana. This analysis provides important data for employers con - sidering or implementing workplace marijuana policies and highlight those industries where marijuana use among workers might reflect a higher proportion of younger workers, such as Accommodation and Food Services and Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation. Awareness of possible employee recreational marijuana use can inform employer policies regarding drug use and workplace impairment. For example, safety-sensitive industries that have higher prevalences of self-reported mari - juana use could consider evaluating their current drug testing programs, drug panels used for preemployment screening, and testing frequencies, and develop policies regarding tolerance of drug use. Drug testing policies need to be explained clearly, including expectations around protocols when injuries occur. Age-adjusted employment data can help to potentially target responsible use education campaigns to particular occupations and industries that employ younger workers. Conflict of Interest No conflicts of interest were reported. 1Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment; 2Private public health consultant.

Eight states, including Colorado, have legalized recreational marijuana use among persons aged 21 years. The association between marijuana use and occupational injury is of public health concern. What is added by this report? During 20142015, 14. 6% of 10, 169 Colorado adult workers reported using marijuana in the past 30 days. The highest prevalences of current use were among young adults and men, and among adults working in the Accommodation and Food Services industry (30. 1%) and Food Preparation and Serving occupation (32. 2%) . What are the implications for public health practice? By understanding the occupations and industries of workers who report recreational marijuana use, employers can develop appropriately targeted workplace marijuana policies and safety awareness campaigns.

Mutyoba, MS2; Alex R. Ario, PhD1; Bao-Ping Zhu, MD3 On October 25, 2016, media reports alerted the Uganda Ministry of Health to an outbreak of >80 cases of vomit - ing, syncope, and acute diarrhea among workers at a flower farm in central Uganda; 27 workers were hospitalized. On November 1, an investigation was undertaken by the Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program. * A case-control study found that working inside greenhouse 7, which had been fumigated with the organosulfur compound metam sodium the night of October 13, was strongly associated with illness. Employees who worked in this greenhouse during October 1421 reported a strong suffocating smell in the greenhouse. Investigation revealed that, in violation of safety protocols, workers did not properly cover the soil after fumigation, allow - ing vapors to become trapped inside the greenhouse. The farm management, unaware of the lapse, failed to inform workers to avoid the vicinity of the fumigation. Respiratory protec - tive measures were not routinely available for workers, which likely contributed to the severity and extent of the outbreak. Although metam sodium is generally considered to be of low risk when used according to manufacturers instructions (1), occupational exposure in the absence of recommended safety measures can have serious health consequences. The investi - gation highlighted the importance of identifying potential occupational hazards to workers, as well as establishing safety protocols in occupational settings, training workers at risk, such as pesticide sprayers and flower pickers, and ensuring enforcement of safety protocols. After this outbreak, the farm management reviewed, revised, and trained the workers on safety protocols to prevent future outbreaks. Epidemiologic Investigation and Findings A case of greenhouse-associated poisoning was defined as the acute onset of shortness of breath, dizziness, syncope, or vomiting in a farm employee during October 2016. Medical records at the farms clinic and nearby hospitals were reviewed. Active case finding was conducted among employees, with the assistance of the farm administrators. Descriptive epidemio - logic analyses were performed, which informed hypothesis gen - eration regarding potential exposures. From October 1 to 13, * Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program, a collaboration between the Uganda Ministry of Health, Makerere University School of Public Health and CDC is based in the Ministry of Health with the main function of investigating disease outbreaks as part of the National Rapid Response Team.  https: //www. cdc. gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/. approximately one case of illness had been reported daily; the number of cases increased sharply on October 14, when 17 cases were reported. During the next 16 days, the number of cases declined to an average of two per day (Figure) . During the environmental assessment, inspection of the chemical warehouse and review of fumigation proto - cols and procedures revealed that metam sodium (sodium N-methyldithiocarbamate) had been used to fumigate green - house 7 on October 13, the day preceding the sharp increase in the number of reported cases. A Uganda Ministry of Internal Affairs analytical laboratory conducted toxicology testing using triple liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in the recently calibrated triple quadrupole liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (2) for traces of metam sodium or methyl isothiocyanate (a metam sodium degradation product) in the blood of nine symptomatic patients. A case-control study was conducted to compare the exposure histories of 65 case-patients who worked during October 1421 and 101 controls, selected from asymptomatic employees who had jobs similar to those of case-patients and who worked during the same period. Logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios comparing the odds of exposure to greenhouse 7 for case-patients and controls. The differences in attack rates by sex and occupation were assessed using Pearsons chi-square test, and statistical significance was defined as p<0. 05. Among the farms 562 employees, 110 cases were identified (attack rate = 20%); 104 (95%) cases occurred in women. The mean age of patients was 25 years (range = 1746 years) . The attack rate was higher among women (22%; 104 of 465) than among men (6%; 6 of 97) (chi-square = 13. 35; p<0. 001), and varied by the nature of work, ranging from 5% among supervisors to 28% among flower pickers, (chi-square = 17. 02; p = 0. 03) (Table) . Overall, 27 (25%) patients were hospitalized and treated with supportive care; no deaths were reported, and all patients fully recovered. The sharp increase in the number of cases on October 14, followed by a gradual decline over the ensuing weeks suggested a continuous common-source toxic exposure. After October 21, incident cases declined to approxi - mately two per day (Figure) . The most commonly reported symptoms included dizziness (74%; 81 of 110), shortness of breath (45%; 50 of 110), eye irritation (45%; 50 of 110), and headache (34%; 37 of 110) . In the case-control study, 83% (54 of 65) of the case-patients and 34% (34 of 101) of controls Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 415 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreported working in greenhouse 7 during October 1421 (odds ratio = 9. 7; 95% confidence interval = 4. 521) . Environmental and Laboratory Investigations According to management staff members, the farms green - houses were fumigated with two rounds of metam sodium annually for pest, fungal, and weed control. Each round con - sisted of fumigation on 3 separate days, approximately 1 week apart. The farms safety protocol mandated that the soil be completely covered with plastic sheeting after fumigation, that supervisors double-check to ensure adherence to the protocol, and that the greenhouse be closed for at least 24 hours before anyone could reenter. During the round associated with this outbreak, greenhouse 7 was fumigated on October 8, 13, and 22 (Figure) . Interviews with farm management staff members revealed that after fumigating greenhouse 7 on October 13, workers did not adhere to the safety protocol, poorly covering the fumigated area; this permitted vapors to escape from the soil and become trapped inside the greenhouse. In addition, the mandated postfumigation double-checking by supervisors was not conducted. Also, the requirement for greenhouse closure for at least 24 hours before reentry was not implemented. No environmental testing or air sampling were conducted in greenhouse 7 during the investigation. Interviews of flower pickers revealed that, apart from rubber boots and aprons, no respiratory, ocular or other personal protective equipment was provided by management for use during routine work, although hand-washing facilities were available. Toxicology testing of nine blood samples collected 29 days after symptom onset (median = 4 days) did not detect traces of methyl isothio - cyanate probably because of chemical degradation over time. The recommendations to the farm management were to review and revise the safe fumigation protocol, conduct train - ing of workers and supervisors on the protocol, enforce strict adherence to the protocol, and institute mitigation measures should there be an exposure (such as eliminating the hazards promptly and warning workers to stay away from the exposed area) . In addition, farm management is currently exploring alternative, less toxic methods for soil treatment, including steaming and biologic methods. Discussion Metam sodium (sodium N-methyldithiocarbamate), a liquid dithiocarbamate, is widely used as a soil fumigant, pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide in agricultural practices (3), with relatively low acute toxicity (4) . However, upon exposure to the environment, the chemical degrades to methyl isothiocyanate, a low melting and powerful lachrymator (5) . Although toxicol - ogy testing of ill patients in this outbreak did not detect traces of methyl isothiocyanate, the signs and symptoms reported by patients and the sharp increase in the number of cases imme - diately after fumigation of the greenhouse in violation of the recommended safety protocol suggest that this outbreak was caused by exposure to metam sodium vapors, which escaped from the soil into greenhouse 7. Respiratory, neurologic, and ocular symptoms have been reported in persons exposed to metam sodium. After  A highly sensitive spectrometer that can detect up to 100 ng/mL was used for toxicology testing. FIGURE.

In 2002, after a soil-incorporated application of metam sodium, a community outbreak of acute ocular and respiratory illnesses occurred in Arvin, California (7) . Respiratory effects of metam sodium exposure have been shown to persist for up to 13 months after the initial acute poisoning (8) . Teratogenicity studies have demonstrated maternal and fetal toxicity in experimental animals such as rats and rabbits after metam sodium exposure (9) . The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified metam sodium as a B2 (probable human) carcinogen (9) . Compared with the outbreak after the Sacramento River spill (6, 10), a higher percentage of patients in this outbreak expe - rienced neurologic symptoms, such as dizziness (74% versus 30%), and syncope (15% versus 0%) . This difference might have been because the metam sodium vapors were trapped inside a greenhouse, and the workers, whose typical work shift was 8 hours, were exposed in an enclosed space, whereas after the Sacramento River spill, vapors reached residents in their homes after being dispersed in the wind. After the Sacramento River spill, some persons reported symptoms more than 1 week after the incident (10) . During the current outbreak, some patients developed symptoms several days after their exposure. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, toxicologic testing did not find evidence of methyl isothiocyanate in the blood samples of the patients tested. Laboratory studies in rats have shown that >85% of orally administered metam sodium was excreted within 24 hours (9) . However, no published data are available on human metabo - lism of metam sodium. It is possible that any metam sodium inhaled or absorbed by the patients was fully metabolized by the time the samples were collected. Second, the case defini - tion was broad and included nonspecific symptoms, which might account for the high background rate. On the other hand, because employees were not provided with appropri - ate personal protective equipment such as masks, the high background rate might represent ongoing chronic exposure to various chemicals, including metam sodium, used in flower farming. Also, the flower farm routinely applied other chemi - cals for pest control in addition to the seasonal fumigation, including thiovit (micronised sulfur), copper oxychloride, ** and trigard, all of which can cause eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation. These chemicals were not used in greenhouse 7 during the exposure period; however, the effects of these chemi - cals and their degradants might partially explain the relatively high number of background cases. Finally, air testing was not conducted to assess the level of metam sodium in greenhouse 7 during the outbreak period. The flower industry is among Ugandas top income gen - erators. Ugandas flowers are exported to European Union countries, the United States, and other countries. In 2015, Uganda exported 7, 500 tons of flowers, generating $34 million in revenue; a quarter of those flowers were sold to the United States (Uganda Flowers Exporters Association, Performance Statistics, unpublished data, 2015) . Ensuring implementation and enforcement of safety protocols for application of fumi - gants and other pest controls is important in protecting the safety and health of workers in this growing industry.  http: //www. herbiguide. com. au/MSDS/MSULP800_53904-0605. pdf. ** http: //www. uap. ca/products/documents/2011-CopperSprayPCP19146. pdf.  https: //www. msdsdigital. com/trigard%C2%AE-msds.

Metam sodium (sodium N-methyldithiocarbamate) is widely used in agriculture as a soil fumigant, pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide. Acute health effects of metam sodium exposure have been rarely described. What is added by this report? In October 2016, an outbreak of vomiting, fainting, and diarrhea occurred among employees of a flower farm in central Uganda; 27 employees were hospitalized. Illness was associated with working inside a greenhouse recently fumigated with metam sodium. Safety protocol violations led to this outbreak. What are the implications for public health practice? This outbreak highlights the importance of establishing, training workers on, and enforcing safety protocols in occupa - tional settings and ensuring that workers are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.

Gardner, PhD1; Ousmane M. Diop, PhD1; Jaume Jorba, PhD3; Smita Chavan, MS2; Jamal Ahmed, MD1; Abhijeet Anand, MBBS2 Global efforts to eradicate polio began in 1988, and four of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions currently have achieved poliofree certification. Within the remaining two regions with endemic poliomyelitis (African and Eastern Mediterranean), Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan have never interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) . The primary means of detecting poliovirus transmission is surveil - lance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years, combined with collection and testing of stool speci - mens for detection of WPV and vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) * in WHO-accredited laboratories within the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) (1, 2) . AFP surveillance is supplemented by environmental surveillance for polioviruses in sewage from selected locations. Genomic sequencing of isolated polioviruses enables the mapping of transmission by time and place, assessment of potential gaps in surveillance, and identification of the emergence of VDPVs (3) . This report presents poliovirus surveillance data from 20162017, with particular focus on six countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) and 20 countries in the African Region (AFR) that reported WPV or circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) during 20112017. Included in the 20 AFR countries are the three most affected by the 20142015 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) outbreak (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), even though only one (Guinea) reported WPV or cVDPVs during the surveil - lance period. During 2017, a total of 14 (70%) of the 20 AFR countries and five (83%) of the six EMR countries met both surveillance quality indicators at the national level; however, provincial-level variation was seen. Surveillance strengthen - ing activities are needed in specific countries of these regions to provide evidence supporting ultimate certification of the interruption of poliovirus circulation. Acute Flaccid Paralysis Surveillance T wo principal indicators measure the quality of AFP surveil - lance. The first is the nonpolio AFP (NPAFP) rate (i. e. , the number of NPAFP cases per 100, 000 children aged <15 years per year); an NPAFP rate 2 is considered sufficiently sensitive to detect WPV or VDPV cases if poliovirus is circulating. The second indicator is the collection of adequate stool specimens from 80% of patients with AFP (2) . Adequacy refers to col - lection of two stool specimens 24 hours apart, within 14 days * Viruses that differ genetically from vaccine viruses and can emerge in areas with low vaccination coverage and cause paralysis. of paralysis onset, and arrival at a WHO-accredited laboratory in good condition. Among all 47 AFR countries evaluated, 31, 759 AFP cases were reported in 2016 and 30, 889 in 2017. No WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in AFR in 2017. The four WPV1 cases that occurred in AFR in 2016 were reported from Borno state in Nigeria (4) . Although no AFP cases or environmental isolates of WPV1 have been detected in Borno for >1 year, it is difficult to determine if transmission of WPV1 persists in pockets of the population where polio surveillance is infeasible or limited (e. g. , in insurgent-controlled and inaccessible areas) (5) . One cVDPV case was reported in AFR during 2016, a cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) case from Nigeria. During 2017, a total of 22 cVDPV cases were reported in AFR, all cVDPV2 cases from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Table 1) . Among the 20 countries evaluated in AFR, 14 (70%) met both national surveillance indicators in 2017, compared with 12 (60%) in 2016. All three Ebola-affected countries had NPAFP rates 2 during 2016 and 2017. In 2016 only Guinea also achieved 80% stool adequacy; however in 2017, Guinea and Liberia both achieved 80% stool adequacy. Among the 21 EMR countries, 15, 951 AFP cases were reported in 2016, and 19, 035 in 2017. T wo EMR countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) reported WPV1 cases in 2016 (33) and 2017 (22) . The number of WPV1 cases reported by Afghanistan remained constant (13 in 2016 and 14 in 2017); the number reported from Pakistan declined from 20 (2016) to eight (2017) . In 2016, one cVDPV2 case was reported in EMR, in Pakistan. In contrast, during 2017, 74 cVDPV cases were reported from EMR. All cases were type 2 and occurred in Syria; the most recent case occurred in September 2017 (Table 1), resulting in the largest cVDPV2 outbreak since the synchronized global cessation of use of type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine in April 2016 (6) . Among the six countries evaluated in EMR, five met both national surveillance indicators in 2017, compared with all six in 2016 (Table 1) . Although overall performance improved in 2017, national-level surveillance indicators masked suboptimal surveillance performance at subnational levels in both regions, (Table 1) (Figure) .  Reverse cold chain maintained and received without leakage or desiccation at a WHO-accredited laboratory. Reverse cold chain is maintained when stool specimens are stored immediately after collection at 48C (3239F), frozen at -20C (-4F) when received for processing, and shipped to a WHO-accredited laboratory in dry ice or cold packs. Freezing of specimens is unnecessary if specimens can be received at a WHO-accredited laboratory within 72 hours of collection.

Environmental surveil - lance collection sites increased in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan, from 21 in 2011 to 143 in 2017. As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiatives global environmental surveillance expansion plan, environmental surveillance is conducted in 91 sites in 38 countries without recent active WPV transmis - sion, including 16 countries on the African continent. In Nigeria, sewage sampling is currently conducted at 70 sites in 18 states and the Federal Capital Territory. No WPV has been isolated since May 2014, and cVDPV2 was last detected in Borno state in March 2016. In Afghanistan, environmental sampling is conducted at 20 sites in nine provinces; five of the 20 sites were added in 2017. WPV1 from four genetic clusters was detected in samples collected among five provinces in 2017. In Pakistan, sampling is conducted at 53 sites in five provinces, including the Islamabad Capital Territory; two of the 53 sites were added in 2017. In 2017, 13% of samples were positive for WPV1, compared with 11% in 2016. WPV1 was detected in all five provinces in 2017. Environmental sampling was established in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 2017, and two of the first three samples collected yielded cVDPV2 isolates. Global Polio Laboratory Network GPLN consists of 146 poliovirus laboratories located in the six WHO regions that are subject to a WHO-led qual - ity assurance program. GPLN member laboratories follow standardized protocols to 1) isolate and identify poliovirus, 2) conduct intratypic differentiation (ITD) to identify WPV or screen for Sabin (vaccine) poliovirus and VDPV (7), and 3) conduct genomic sequencing. Sequencing results help monitor pathways of poliovirus transmission by comparing the nucleotide sequence of the VP1-coding region of poliovirus isolates. To meet standard laboratory timeliness indicators for processing a stool specimen, laboratories should report 80% of poliovirus isolation results within 14 days of specimen receipt, 80% of ITD results within 7 days of isolate receipt, and 80% of sequencing results within 7 days of ITD result. The standard combined field and laboratory performance indicator is to report ITD results for 80% of isolates within 60 days of paralysis onset in AFP cases. This indicator con - siders the entire interval from paralysis onset to specimen testing (EMR countries use a 45-day timeliness standard) .

(Continued) National and subnational acute flaccid paralysis surveillance indicators and number of confirmed wild poliovirus and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases, by country, for all countries with poliovirus transmission during 20112017 and those that were affected by the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa  World Health Organization African Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region, 20162017 *Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 421 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe accuracy and quality of testing at GPLN laboratories is monitored through an annual accreditation program of onsite reviews and proficiency testing. During 2017, an accreditation checklist, including standard laboratory timeliness indicators for sewage sample processing, was implemented for laboratories conducting environmental surveillance. GPLN tested 218, 478 stool specimens from patients with AFP in 2016 and 201, 546 in 2017. WPV1 was isolated from 37 AFP case samples in 2016 and 22 AFP case samples in 2017. In addition, cVDPV was detected from 11 AFP cases in 2016 and 96 in 2017. GPLN laboratories met timeliness indicators for poliovirus isolation in all regions (Table 2) . The overall timeliness indicator for onset to ITD results was met in all regions in both years. Overall genetic diversity declined among WPV1 isolates in 2017. In 2017, South Asia (SOAS) genotype was the only WPV1 genotype circulating globally and was detected in Afghanistan and Pakistan. West Africa B1 (WEAF-B1) geno - type was last detected in Nigeria in 2016. Sequence analysis associated with the SOAS genotype indicates that WPV1 cases might have been missed by AFP surveillance in 2017; orphan WPV1 isolates (those with less genetic relatedness [98. 5% in VP1 gene] to other circulating viruses) were associated with three of 22 WPV1 cases reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan, indicating possible gaps in AFP surveillance. In 2017, cVDPV viruses with extended divergence from the parental Sabin strain were also isolated from stool specimens of AFP cases and from environmental samples in three countries.

Timeliness was defined as two specimens collected 24 hours apart (1 calendar day) and both within 14 days of paralysis onset. Good condition was defined as specimens arriving without leakage or desiccation in a maintained reverse cold chain at a World Health Organization accredited laboratory.  Data are for AFP cases with onset during 2017, reported as of February 22, 2018. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 422 MMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDiscussion The number of reported WPV cases declined to the lowest point ever in 2017; however, reported cVDPV cases increased from 2016 to 2017 because of major cVDPV2 outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Syria. Although most national-level surveillance quality indicators improved in 2017, considerable variation exists at subnational levels, particularly in inaccessible areas, and timely detection of circulating polio - viruses can be hampered if active surveillance efforts are not rigorous. Repeated detection of WPV and cVDPV from sew - age samples in locations where poliovirus cases have not been detected or where sewage detections have preceded detection in persons can provide early evidence of viral circulation within a community (e. g. , WPV isolation in Pakistan during 2017) (8) . Strategies to strengthen AFP surveillance in areas where conflict occurs have included increased AFP case searches among camps for internally displaced persons, engagement of community members in inaccessible areas, and active case searches in newly accessible areas (5) . Although conflict might limit access to standard health facilitybased surveillance, community-based surveillance has been effective in finding AFP cases, providing some assurance of the absence of poliovirus circulation in criti - cal areas. For example, in Somalia, community volunteers have been instrumental in reporting AFP cases in inaccessible and partially accessible areas (9) . The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita - tions. First, security-related issues, issues associated with mobile and difficult-to-access populations, or other factors that affect surveillance performance could affect interpretation of AFP surveillance indicators. Second, high NPAFP rates do not necessarily imply sensitive surveillance, because a proportion of reported AFP cases might not be actual AFP cases, and not all actual AFP cases might be detected. Certification of poliofree status requires at least 3 years of timely and sensitive poliovirus surveillance (10), including timely stool specimen collection and timely and appropriate transport of specimens to the laboratory. In 2017, specimen condition was a concern in Chad, DRC, Gabon, Niger, Sierra Leone, and Syria. Use of mobile technologies to improve timeliness and accuracy of AFP reporting in geographically hard-to-reach areas might be useful in some countries when linked with vigorous specimen collection (5) .

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 423 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsubnational levels, is important to achieve high-quality surveil - lance that can detect poliovirus transmission. Environmental surveillance has been an important supplement to AFP surveil - lance and, when carefully conducted in populations covered by sewage networks, can improve detection of circulating virus, particularly in high-risk areas with suboptimal AFP surveil - lance (3) . Polio surveillance efforts need to reach geographically difficult-to-access and security-compromised areas and mobile and migrant populations. Surveillance data should be assessed routinely to identify suboptimal data quality. The need for strong poliovirus surveillance will continue beyond certifica - tion of eradication, until well after the use of all oral poliovirus vaccine has stopped globally. Poliovirus surveillance will need to be integrated with surveillance of other vaccine-preventable diseases to sustain capacity and maintain sufficient perfor - mance quality. As long as polioviruses continue to circulate in any country, all countries remain at risk. Acknowledgments Situational Awareness Branch, Division of Emergency Operations, CDC; Steven G.

Surveillance is the cornerstone of polio eradication efforts. What is added by this report? In 2017, 22 wild poliovirus cases were reported from two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan), the fewest number ever reported globally. Polio cases caused by circulating vaccinederived polioviruses increased from four in 2016 to 96 in 2017 because of large outbreaks in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although surveillance performance indicators are improving at the national level, gaps remain, including at subnational levels. What are the implications for public health practice? As polio cases decline, sensitive and timely surveillance becomes even more important. As long as polioviruses circulate in any country, all countries remain at risk. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 424 MMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionUpdated CDC Recommendations for Using Artemether-Lumefantrine for the Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria in Pregnant Women in the United States Sarah-Blythe Ballard, MD, PhD1, 2; Allison Salinger, MPHc2, 3; Paul M. Arguin, MD2; Meghna Desai, PhD2; Kathrine R. Tan, MD2 Malaria infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for maternal and fetal complications. In the United States, treatment options for uncomplicated, chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria in pregnant women are limited to mefloquine or quinine plus clindamycin (1) . However, limited availability of quinine and increasing resistance to mefloquine restrict these options. Strong evidence now demonstrates that artemetherlumefantrine (AL) (Coartem) is effective and safe in the treat - ment of malaria in pregnancy. The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), such as AL, for treatment of uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and is currently considering whether to add ACTs, including AL, as an option for malaria treatment during the first trimester (2, 3) . This policy note reviews the evidence and updates CDC recommendations to include AL as a treatment option for uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimes - ters of pregnancy and during the first trimester of pregnancy when other treatment options are unavailable. These updated recommendations reflect current evidence and are consistent with WHO treatment guidelines. Background Each year, approximately 1, 700 cases of imported malaria occur in the United States; approximately 630 (37%) of these cases occur in women, including 5%6% who are pregnant at the time they are infected (4) . T reatment options for uncompli - cated, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections in pregnant women in the United States are threat - ened by the spread of mefloquine resistance in Southeast Asia. Having only one quinine and mefloquine manufacturer in the United States can adversely affect access. In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AL for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. At that time, this combination was not approved for use in pregnancy because animal research data indicated a potential association with poor pregnancy outcomes, and insufficient human data were available. Since then, global experience has contributed substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of AL throughout pregnancy. Given the need for an additional option to treat uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women in the United States, a systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AL use during pregnancy, and findings were used to update CDC recommendations. Methods A systematic review of English-language research articles listed in PubMed was conducted using the keywords artemether, lumefantrine, Coartem, and malaria in preg - nancy. Clinical trials, observational studies, meta-analyses, and case reports of uncomplicated malaria treatment during preg - nancy were included. Studies that did not include treatment or pregnancy outcomes were excluded, as were studies that did not identify the trimester of treatment. Review article and metaanalysis references were examined for additional primary source articles for inclusion. Online search results were compiled and deduplicated. T wo independent reviewers determined the rel - evance of each article to the research objective based first on title, then abstract, then full text. If reviewers had discordant findings from title or abstract review, the article was included in the next review phase. The following data were abstracted and reviewed: participant age; geographic location; parity; rea - son for drug treatment (uncomplicated versus severe malaria); trimesters during which treatment occurred; medication dose administered; treatment duration; treatment outcomes; and pregnancy outcomes, which included miscarriage (pregnancy loss at <28 weeks gestation), stillbirth (pregnancy loss at 28 weeks gestation), preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), low birth weight (<2, 500 g), congenital abnormalities, and any maternal adverse events reported. Rationale and Evidence Systematic review results. In the initial search, 1, 726 articles were identified. After excluding four articles during deduplication, 1, 534 during title review, 94 during abstract review, and 73 after full text review, 21 articles remained and were included in the review. Efficacy. One meta-analysis (5) and five randomized openlabel controlled trials performed in Uganda and Thailand examined the efficacy of ACTs for uncomplicated P. falciparum in women during their second and third trimesters of pregnancy and found cure rates 94. 9%, with ACTs performing equal to or better than quinine-based regimens (Table 1) (610) . A meta-analysis of African and Asian studies found lower but statistically similar treatment failure rates by days 2863 in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 425 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwomen taking ACTs versus non-ACTs to treat uncomplicated malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (pooled risk ratio random effects = 0. 41; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0. 161. 06; six trials) (5) . With respect to AL efficacy during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, a concern existed that a reduction in relative bioavailability of lumefantrine in pregnant women might affect treatment success later in preg - nancy (1115) . However, the evidence presented indicates that treatment in pregnancy is efficacious at the doses currently recommended for nonpregnant women. Second and third trimester safety. Data evaluating preg - nancy outcomes in women taking ACTs during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy were available from 16 stud - ies (Table 2) . No differences in pregnancy outcomes were identified in four trials comparing ACTs with quinine-based regimens in Uganda and Thailand (6, 7, 9, 10), one of which used AL (9), and in four other trials comparing AL with other ACTs in Nigeria (two studies), Thailand, and multiple sites in Africa (1619) . A Zambian cohort study comparing treatment of uncomplicated malaria using AL with treatment using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine found similar pregnancy outcomes between groups (20) . In addition, two meta-analyses of women with malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy found no association between ACT treatment and congenital malformations or miscarriage (5, 21) . Overall, fewer maternal adverse events occurred among women taking ACTs than among those taking non-ACTs (Table 2) . One trial in Thailand found a relatively higher proportion of day 7 anemia among those treated with mefloquine-artesunate (67%) than among those treated with a quinine-based regimen (42%) (6) . Four trials and one meta-analysis comparing ACTs with quinine-based regimens found that pregnant women taking quinine had higher rates of tinnitus, dizziness, and vomiting than did pregnant women taking ACTs (59) . The three trials comparing AL with other ACTs found no differences in rates of serious adverse maternal effects between groups (9, 16, 18) . First trimester safety. No randomized trials evaluating AL use during the first trimester of pregnancy were found (Table 3) . However, a meta-analysis of observational and other studies from six sub-Saharan African countries and the Thai-Burmese border included data from a total of 717 women taking ACTs during the first trimester of pregnancy (22) .

(Continued) Summary of studies using artemisinin-based treatment for malaria in second and third trimesters of pregnancy and safety outcomesMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 428 MMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionanytime during the first trimester and treatment with ACTs versus quinine-based regimen during 612 weeks gestational age demonstrated no differences in miscarriage, stillbirth, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage and still birth combined) for women treated with ACTs versus quinine-based regimens during either period. Although limited by sample size, the pooled prevalences of congenital anomalies in infants born to mothers taking ACTs versus quinine-based regimens in the first trimester were similar (1. 5%, 95% CI = 0. 63. 5 versus 1. 2%, 95% CI = 0. 62. 4, respectively) (22) . Recommendation Malaria infection during pregnancy can result in serious maternal and fetal complications. On the basis of the strength and quality of this evidence, CDC recommends AL as an additional option for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women in the United States during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy at the same doses recommended for nonpregnant women. Women in the United States with uncomplicated malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy should be treated with the currently recommended options of either mefloquine or quinine plus clindamycin. However, when neither of these options is available, AL should be considered for treatment. Discussion This update of CDC recommendations based on accumu - lated evidence of the safety of AL in pregnancy is in line with the malaria treatment guidelines of other countries without endemic malaria and WHO (3, 23, 24) . On the basis of the current strength and quality of the first trimester safety and efficacy evidence, the addition of ACTs, including AL, as a first-line treatment option for uncomplicated malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy is being considered by WHO after the Malaria Policy Advisory Committees review (2, 3) . Women seeking care in the United States will now have a third treatment option for uncomplicated malaria during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and during the first trimester of pregnancy when other treatment options are unavailable, that is safe and effective for treating P. falciparum infections acquired in regions with chloroquine resistance. To assess the implementation and impact of these updated recommenda - tions in the United States, data from the National Malaria Surveillance System will be used to examine how antimalarials Abbreviations: A = atovaquone; AL = artemether-lumefantrine; AQ = amodiaquine; Ar = artemether; As = artesunate; BID = twice daily; CL = clindamycin; CQ = chloroquine; d = day (s); DHA-PIP = dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine; hr = hour (s); IM = intramuscular; IUGR = intrauterine growth retardation; kg = kilogram; LapDap = chlorproguanil-dapsone; mg = milligram; MQ = mefloquine; P = proguanil; Q = quinine; qd = once daily; q8hr = every 8 hours; SP = sulfadoxine pyrimethamine. * In studies with incomplete outcome data, denominators are provided.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / April 13, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 14 433 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention* Deaths per 100, 000 population are age-adjusted to the 2000 U. S. standard population.  As underlying cause of death, suicide is identified with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes X60X84, Y87. 0, and also code U03. From 2015 to 2016, the age-adjusted suicide rate for the total U. S. population increased from 13. 3 per 100, 000 standard population to 13. 5 (an increase of 1. 5%) . The rate increased from 5. 8 to 6. 3 (8. 6%) for non-Hispanic blacks and from 6. 2 to 6. 7 (8. 1%) for Hispanics; it remained unchanged for non-Hispanic whites. In both 2015 and 2016, the non-Hispanic white rate was nearly three times the non-Hispanic black rate and 2. 5 times the rate for the Hispanic population. Source: National Vital Statistics System.
