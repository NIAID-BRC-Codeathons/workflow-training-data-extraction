Goals include increasing awareness about the risk for overdose, reducing stigma associated with drug overdose deaths, providing information about community services, and prevent-ing and reducing drug-related harm by supporting evidence-based policy and practice (https: //www. overdoseday. com) . The opioid overdose epidemic, which killed over 42, 000 Americans in 2016 (1), has included three interrelated waves since 1999 (2) . The first included increases in overdose deaths related to prescription opioids. In 2010, the second wave began and was characterized by a rapid increase in deaths involving heroin. The third and current wave, which began in 2013, is associated with a rapid increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. Varying circumstances have been associated with each of these waves, and their intersection presents a unique challenge for a focused and comprehensive response. Opioid deaths, particularly those involving illicit opioids, continue to increase. As described in a report in this issue of MMWR, illicit opioids were detected in approximately three of four opioid overdose deaths compared with nearly four of 10 for prescription opioids in 11 states examined. Enhanced surveillance for opioid overdose deaths facilitates the classification of deaths involving prescription and illicit opioids as well as identifying missed opportunities for prevention and response.

Approximately one in 10 decedents had been released from an institutional set - ting in the month preceding the fatal overdose. Bystanders were reportedly present in approximately 40% of deaths; however, naloxone was rarely administered by a layperson. Enhanced surveillance data from 11 states provided more complete information on the substances involved in and cir - cumstances surrounding opioid overdose deaths. Consistent with other emerging evidence and recommendations,  these data suggest prevention efforts should prioritize naloxone distribution to persons misusing opioids or using high dos - age prescription opioids and to their family members and friends.

CDC funds 32 states and the District of Columbia to abstract death certificate and medical examiner and coroner data, including toxicology results, on opioid deaths, through the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System, a component of ESOOS. Data are collected on death scene investigations (e. g. , evidence of illicit or prescription drug use), circumstances occurring close in time to the death (e. g. , presence of bystanders), history of substance use treat - ment, prior history of overdose, and demographics. For all opioid deaths classified as unintentional or of undetermined intent, states list all positive tests for opioid and nonopi-oid substances (present or detected), and whether the medical examiner or coroner determined that the substance contributed to the overdose death (involved) .  CDC  S tate Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) estimates of opioid-involved overdose deaths might differ from those of the National Vital Statistics System because SUDORS uses preliminary death certificate data and collects additional information from medical examiner and coroner reports, which are abstracted within 8 months of death. In SUDORS, an opioid-involved overdose death either was identified through review of the medical examiner/coroner report or had International Classification of Diseases, T enth Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause-of-death codes X4044 (unintentional) or Y10Y14 (undetermined) and multiple cause-of-death codes of T40. 0, T40. 1, T40. 2, T40. 3, T40. 4, or T40. 6 on the death certificate.

Kentucky had the highest percentage of deaths with both prescription and illicit opioids (26. 5%) present, followed by Missouri (25. 1%) . Among prescription opioidonly deaths, the median age of decedents was 47 years, 51. 0% were female, and 86. 2% were non-Hispanic white (white) . Among illicit opioidonly deaths, the median age of decedents was 36 years, 73. 0% were male, and 81. 1% were white. Among deaths for which both prescrip - tion and illicit opioids were detected, decedents median age was 39 years, 70. 5% were male, and 83. 6% were white (Table) . Evidence of injection drug use was found in approximately half of illicit opioid deaths, but only 6. 6% of prescription opioidonly deaths. Other drugs were frequently detected in opioid deaths (Table) . Benzodiazepines and gabapentin were detected in 51. 6% and 21. 6% of prescription opioidonly deaths, respectively. Among illicit opioidonly deaths, cocaine was detected in 34. 9% of deaths and benzodiazepines were detected in 24. 0% of deaths. Among deaths for which both prescription and illicit opioids were detected, benzodiazepines were detected in 44. 5% and cocaine in 34. 8%. Approximately one in 10 decedents had evidence of having been released from an institutional setting in the month preced - ing the fatal overdose, with the most common settings being jail, prison, or detention facilities when only illicit opioids were involved (4. 9%), and hospitals when only prescription opioids were involved (4. 1%) . Previous drug overdose at any time before the fatal overdose was noted in 15. 1% of illicit opioidonly deaths, 13. 5% of deaths with both prescription and illicit opioids present, and 9. 3% of prescription opioidonly deaths. Bystanders were reported to have been present in 44% of opioid deaths, but naloxone was seldom administered by a layperson (in approximately 4% of deaths involving only illicit opioids and 0. 8% of prescription opioidonly deaths) . Discussion This report is one of the first to use medical examiner and coroner reports across multiple states and provides informa - tion that can be used to better inform prevention and response programs related to opioid overdose deaths. Specifically, among these 11 states, there is improved understanding of prescrip - tion and illicit opioid involvement, polysubstance use, and potential missed opportunities to intervene to prevent opioid overdose deaths. Previous efforts to differentiate illicit and prescription opioid deaths were limited by grouping within the same drug categories (e. g. , synthetic opioids, excluding methadone) and by the difficulty in determining whether detection of morphine or fentanyl by forensic toxicology testing indicates the presence of prescription or illicit opioids (2, 3) .  Findings from this analysis indicate that illicit opioids were a major driver of opioid deaths, especially among younger per - sons, and were detected in approximately three of four deaths overall. Prescription opioids were detected in approximately four of 10 deaths. Illicit opioids predominated in all states except Oklahoma. Among these 11 states, the evolving opioid overdose epi - demic differentially affects states and regions, but most states were simultaneously struggling with a complex mix of prescrip - tion and illicit opioid deaths. In this analysis, four polysub - stance use patterns highlight an urgent need for targeted and comprehensive action. First, approximately half of prescription opioidonly deaths tested positive for benzodiazepines, which are known to depress the central nervous system and increase the risk of overdose and death. *** This high-risk drug-use pattern can be targeted for intervention. Second, gabapentin (a nonopioid medication commonly prescribed for neuropathic pain), was found in approximately one in five prescription opioidonly deaths and in approximately one in 10 deaths in the other groups. Consistent with recent reports (4), the combined use of gabapentin and opioids might be an indicator of high-risk opioid misuse and requires further study. In the illicit opioidonly group, the percentage of deaths testing positive for cocaine and methamphetamine is similar to other reports (5) . Finally, extensive use of cocaine and benzodiazepines among deaths where both prescription and illicit opioids were detected highlights the need for prevention and treatment programs to address polysubstance use (6) . Identification of circumstances surrounding overdose deaths can help inform prevention programs and efforts to target resources. Approximately one in 10 decedents had been released from an institution in the month before the fatal overdose. Rhode Island found that expanding enrollment in a medication-assisted treatment program for incarcerated persons was associated with a 60% decrease in postincarceration overdose deaths (7) . For the 14% of decedents with previous overdoses, there might have been opportunities for linkage to care and treatment services, especially if the overdose involved an emergency department  http: //ajph. aphapublications. org/doi/10. 2105/AJPH. 2017. 304265. *** The F ood and Drug Administration issued its strongest warning against combining benzodiazepines with opioids because of risk for overdose. https: // www. fda. gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm518473. htm.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 950 MMWR / August 31, 2018 / V ol. 67 / No. 34 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionvisit (8) . The proportions of decedents with evidence of recent release from an institution and of a previous overdose were higher among deaths involving illicit opioids. Similar to earlier find - ings (9), approximately half of the decedents overdosed when bystanders were present. Although distribution of naloxone to laypersons has rapidly expanded and been determined to be effective,  broader distribution and education about overdose signs and symptoms are needed. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, because there is no national standard for forensic toxicology testing, testing protocols vary across jurisdictions, which affects whether substances were detected. Second, jurisdictions vary in how they classify whether substances with positive toxicology results contribute to death. Third, evidence of overdose-specific circumstances should be interpreted with caution because it relies upon availability of information within medical examiner and coroner reports and focuses on information from a period close to death; thus, prevalence of circumstances is likely underestimated. Fourth, missing information might have resulted in some misclassification of prescription and illicit substance use; however, this was mini - mized by using detailed toxicology results and scene evidence. Finally, the results are limited to the 11 participating states and cannot be generalized to the United States. Among 11 states, illicit opioids were a major driver of opioid overdose deaths; however, prescription opioids also contribute to a substantial number of these deaths. Interventions should be guided by the substances detected and contributing to overdose deaths in a given locale and might differ for overdoses involving prescription or illicit opioids, or both. For example, for preventing illicit opioid overdose, integrating public health strategies within public safety (e. g. , law enforcement providing linkages to care for persons with substance use disorders), as well as using syringe services programs for naloxone distribu - tion, providing access to treatment, and addressing blood borne infections might have a larger impact. To prevent prescription opioid overdose, strategies might emphasize prescription drug monitoring programs, face-to-face education of prescribers by trained health care professionals, typically pharmacists, physi - cians, or nurses (a process known as academic detailing), and implementation of the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (10) . However, interventions should not focus exclusively on one opioid type because the epidemic continues to evolve, and use of opioids along with other substances is common. Continued and increased attention should capitalize on opportunities for overdose prevention including linking to treatment during and upon release from an institution or after a nonfatal overdose and expanding naloxone access.  https: //www. bmj. com/content/346/bmj. f174. Summary What is already known about this topic? In 2016, opioids were involved in 42, 249 U. S. overdose deaths. What is added by this report? Among 11 reporting states, most (58. 7%) opioid overdose deaths involved illicit opioids only, followed by those where both illicit and prescription opioids were detected (18. 5%); 17. 4% of deaths involved prescription opioids only. Bystanders to the overdose, who could potentially intervene, were documented in 44% of deaths; however, laypersons rarely administered naloxone. What are the implications for public health practice? Development of overdose prevention programs should consider the types of opioids contributing to deaths, link persons to treatment during and upon release from an institution or after a nonfatal overdose, and expand naloxone distribution to laypersons.

Armour, PhD1; Israel T. Agaku, DMD, PhD1 During the past few decades, wide disparities in tobacco product use have been documented among the largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States (1, 2); however, little is known about tobacco product use among youths from racial/ethnic groups other than whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Surveillance reports typically aggre - gate these racial/ethnic minorities into a single category because of small sample sizes (3) . To assess tobacco product use among U. S. middle and high school students from seven racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic whites [whites], non-Hispanic blacks [blacks], Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asians [Asians], non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska natives [AI/ANs], non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders [NHOPIs], and non-Hispanic multiracial persons [multiracial]), CDC analyzed pooled data from the 20142017 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) . Prevalence of ever (1 time in lifetime) and current (1 time in past 30 days) use of seven tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes [e-cigarettes], hookahs, pipes, and bidis) was assessed; any tobacco product use was defined as use of one or more tobacco products, including hand-rolled cigarettes. During 20142017, ever-use of any tobacco product among U. S. middle and high school students was as follows: NHOPIs (45. 1%), AI/ ANs (43. 8%), multiracial persons (38. 2%), Hispanics (35. 1%), blacks (32. 3%), whites (32. 0%), and Asians (16. 3%) . Current use of any tobacco product was as follows: NHOPIs (23. 4%), AI/ANs (20. 6%), multiracial persons (16. 5%), whites (15. 3%), Hispanics (14. 6%), blacks (11. 5%), and Asians (5. 0%) . Among black middle and high school students, cigars were the most common product currently used, whereas e-cigarettes were the most commonly used product for all other racial/ethnic groups. Comprehensive and sustained implementation of evidence-based, population-level tobacco control interventions could reduce preva - lence and disparities in tobacco product use among U. S. youths. NYTS is a cross-sectional, voluntary, school-based, paper-andpencil questionnaire administered to U. S. middle (grades 68) and high (grades 912) school students. A three-stage cluster sampling procedure was used to generate a nationally representative sample of U. S. students attending public and private schools. * For these analyses, data were pooled across four cycles of NYTS (20142017) to allow sufficient sample size to assess tobacco product use among each of the racial/ethnic groups. Averaged annual sample size and response rate were 19, 566 and 69. 1%, respectively.  * https: //www. cdc. gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/index. htm.  Annual sample siz es and response rates were 22, 007: 73. 3% (2014); 17, 711: 63. 4% (2015); 20, 675: 71. 6% (2016); and 17, 872: 68. 1% (2017) . Participants were asked about ever and current use of seven tobacco product types: cigarettes, cigars (cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars), smokeless tobacco products (chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco), e-cigarettes, hookahs, pipes, and bidis. Use of hand-rolled cigarettes was also assessed in the survey, but is not reported separately as a distinct tobacco product type because the majority (88. 7%) of persons who reported smoking hand-rolled cigarettes also smoked regular cigarettes. Any tobacco product use was defined as use of 1 tobacco product types, including hand-rolled cigarettes. Data were weighted to adjust for differential nonresponse and to yield nationally representative estimates. Pooled sample sizes for each racial/ethnic group during 20142017 included 32, 358 whites, 11, 664 blacks, 21, 337 Hispanics, 3, 321 Asians, 1, 213 AI/ANs, 456 NHOPIs, and 4, 106 multiracial persons. Prevalence was calculated overall and by race/ethnicity; within each racial/ethnic group, prevalence was further stratified by sex and school level (middle or high school) . Comparisons between and within each racial/ethnic group were performed with chi-squared tests, with statistical significance defined as p<0. 05. Estimates with relative standard errors 30% were sup - pressed. Differences in any tobacco product use across groups were assessed using Poisson regression models adjusted for sex and school level. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, with the group with the lowest prevalence (Asians) serving as the referent group. Ever-Use of Tobacco Products During 20142017, ever-use of any tobacco product among U. S. middle and high school students was highest among NHOPIs (45. 1%) and AI/ANs (43. 8%), and did not significantly differ between these groups. Compared with these two groups, prevalence of ever-use of any tobacco product was significantly lower among multiracial persons (38. 2%), Hispanics (35. 1%), blacks (32. 3%), whites (32. 0%), and Asians (16. 3%) (Table 1) .  R espondents were asked whether they have ever used/smoked the respective tobacco products, or asked Which of the following tobacco products have you ever tried, even just one time? , depending on the type of products and survey years. Those who provided an affirmative response or specified their product (s) from the product list provided were classified as ever tobacco product users.  R espondents were asked on how many days in the past 30 days they used/smoked the respective tobacco products, or asked In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you used on at least one day? , depending on the type of products and survey years. Those who answered 1 day or specified their product (s) from the product list provided were classified as current tobacco product users.

E-cigarettes were the most common currently used tobacco product overall (9. 2%) and among all racial/ethnic groups except black students (Table 2), among whom the most common currently used product was cigars (6. 7%), followed by e-cigarettes (5. 1%) . Discussion Marked disparities in tobacco product use exist among U. S. youths by race/ethnicity. Tobacco product use is higher among NHOPIs and AI/ANs, with nearly one in two NHOPI (45. 1%) and AI/AN (43. 8%) youths reporting ever using at least one tobacco product. Early exposure to nicotine during adolescence can lead to stronger addiction to tobacco products (2), and tobacco product experimentation is a critical step in developing dependence (4) . Given that most adult smokers first try cigarettes before age 18 years, and that progression from occasional to daily smoking typically occurs during early adulthood (2), these disparities among youths might contribute to the higher rates of tobacco product use among adults from these racial/ethnic groups (1, 5) . Summary What is known about this topic? Wide disparities in tobacco product use have been documented among the largest U. S. racial/ethnic groups; however, apart from the three most populous groups (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics), little is known about tobacco use among youths from other racial/ethnic groups. What is added by this report? During 20142017, ever-use and current use of any tobacco product among U. S. middle and high school students were highest among Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders and American Indians/Alaska Natives and lowest among Asians. What are the implications for public health practice? Comprehensive and sustained implementation of evidencebased, population-level tobacco control interventions could reduce prevalence of and disparities in tobacco product use among U. S. youths. Use of specific tobacco products varied by race/ethnicity. Ever-use was highest for cigarettes among AI/AN students (31. 4%), highest for cigars among black students (19. 9%), and highest for e-cigarettes among all other racial/ethnic groups. E-cigarettes were the most common currently used tobacco product among youths overall (9. 2%) and all racial/ethnic groups except blacks, among whom cigar smoking was most prevalent. Given that cigar smoking has historically been higher among black adults than other racial/ethnic groups (6, 7), these findings suggest distinct acculturation and social norms regarding tobacco use across racial/ethnic groups. Observed disparities in tobacco product use might also be attributable to racial/ethnic variations in targeted tobacco industry advertising, marketing, and promotional activities (1, 2, 8) . For example, some cigarettes have been promoted using tribal icons and logos to attract AI/AN persons (1) . In addition, mentholated and other flavored tobacco products have been heavily promoted to certain racial/ethnic minority populations, including black communities (9) . Flavored additives can mask the harshness of tobacco products, which might make it easier for nonusers to try their first tobacco product (9) . The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, tobacco product use was self-reported and might have been subject to recall and social desirability bias. Second, small sample sizes of some subgroups within the assessed racial/ ethnic categories resulted in imprecise estimates that could not be reported. Finally, these analyses used pooled data across 4 years, and therefore do not reflect possible secular trends in prevalence and disparities in youth tobacco product use. Evidence-based strategies that have been proven to reduce youth tobacco use include tobacco product price increases, policies that protect persons from secondhand smoke exposure Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / August 31, 2018 / V ol. 67 / No. 34 955 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 2.

In addition, states and communities have worked to reduce youth tobacco use by raising the minimum age for sale of tobacco products to 21 years (10) . As of August 2018, six states (California, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Oregon) and several hundred localities have raised the minimum age of tobacco product sales to 21 years. ** Ensuring that these interventions reach all population groups, coupled with targeted strategies that acknowledge sociocultural dimensions of tobacco use among racial/ethnic groups, could reduce tobacco product use and tobacco-related disparities among U.

Burton3 Dadaab Refugee camp in Garissa County, Kenya, hosts nearly 340, 000 refugees in five subcamps (Dagahaley, Hagadera, Ifo, Ifo2, and Kambioos) (1) . On November 18 and 19, 2015, during an ongoing national cholera outbreak (2), two camp residents were evaluated for acute watery diarrhea (three or more stools in 24 hours); Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 serotype Ogawa was isolated from stool specimens collected from both patients. Within 1 week of the report of index cases, an additional 45 cases of acute watery diarrhea were reported. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and their health-sector partners coordinated the cholera response, com - munity outreach and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) activities; Mdecins Sans Frontires and the International Rescue Committee were involved in management of cholera treatment centers; CDC performed laboratory confirmation of cases and undertook GIS mapping and postoutbreak response assessment; and the Garissa County Government and the Kenya Ministry of Health conducted a case-control study. To prevent future cholera outbreaks, improvements to WASH and enhanced disease surveillance systems in Dadaab camp and the surrounding area are needed. Investigation and Findings Case ascertainment. A suspected cholera case was defined as the occurrence of acute watery diarrhea in any person aged 2 years seen at a camp health facility on or after November 18, 2015, or in a child aged <2 years who was epidemio - logically linked to a confirmed cholera case. Stool specimens were collected from one of every 23 patients with suspected cholera and tested using standard microbiological methods*; cholera isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance by disc-diffusion. Suspected cases with a stool culture positive for V. cholerae were considered to be laboratory-confirmed (3) . Demographic and clinical data were recorded for all sus - pected and confirmed cases. Characteristics of cholera cases were described, and case fatality rates calculated. Geographic information system software was used to map the calculated cumulative attack rates by age, sex, and residential block in * Rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for cholera were also used for cholera diagnosis in the camp; however, cholera RDT testing and results were not collected systematically, and are not presented here. each of the five subcamps. Spatial clustering of cholera cases by block, adjusted to the blocks population density, was evaluated using the softwares Average Nearest Neighbor function (4), which indicated clustering in some blocks. During November 18, 2015June 6, 2016, a total of 1, 797 cases of cholera, including 1, 548 suspected and 249 confirmed, were reported among the camps 348, 781 residents (Figure); 20 cases that occurred in persons from the host community and were treated in the camp health facilities are included. Males accounted for 904 (51%) cases. The overall attack rate was 5. 1 per 1, 000 residents, with the highest attack rate occur - ring in children aged 24 years (16. 9); attack rates varied by subcamp (Table 1) . Fourteen deaths were reported (case fatality rate = 0. 79%) . After identification of the two index cases on November 18 and 19, the outbreak quickly spread in the subcamps of Hagadera (attack rate = 8. 0 per 1, 000; peak = December 1827), Dagahaley (7. 7; November 28December 7), and Kambioos (5. 3; December 28January 6) (Table 1); among 252 residential blocks in these three subcamps, 195 (77%) reported at least one case. Fewer cases were reported in Ifo (attack rate = 0. 6 per 1, 000) and Ifo2 (1. 7), where only 10% 30% of residential blocks reported at least one case. Incidence among affected residential blocks ranged from 0. 1% to 20%; spatial clustering of cases occurred in all the subcamps within the residential blocks (p<0. 01) . Identification of risk factors. In December 2015, the Kenya Ministry of Health conducted a case-control study in the subcamps most affected (Dagahaley and Hagadera) to identify risk factors for cholera. Persons with suspected or con - firmed cholera (one per household) clinically evaluated before December 31, 2015, were eligible for inclusion. Eligible con - trols were Dagahaley or Hagadera residents aged 2 years with no history of acute watery diarrhea during the same period. Each case-patient was frequency matched to two controls by subcamp and age group (24 years, 514 years, 1524 years, and 25 years) . A standardized questionnaire was developed that adopted some questions from previous efforts, and it was administered to case-patients and controls (or their caregivers) to collect demographic and exposure information.

No evidence of disease clustering by ethnic background or geographic origin was found. Assessment of outbreak control measures. In late January 2016, as the outbreak waned, CDC and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees conducted site visits in four subcamps to assess outbreak control measures. Residual chlorine levels were below outbreak standards in various water sources, including tap stands (outbreak standard = 1. 0 mg/L) and households (outbreak standard = 0. 5 mg/L), and hand - washing facilities in schools, markets, and eateries were insuf - ficient. Pools of stagnant water where children played were observed near affected residential blocks in Dagahaley and Ifo2 subcamps. Although the average number of persons per latrine in Dadaab met the international standard for refugee camps (one latrine per 20 persons) (5, 6), in some subcamps, up to 60 persons were observed to be sharing one latrine. In addition, at the outbreak onset in November 2015, only 168 community health workers were in the camp (approximately one per 2, 000 residents), one quarter of the internationally recommended standard of one per 500 residents (5) . Some households anecdotally reported cases of cholera in multiple household members, although this information was not sys - tematically collected. Assessment of antibiotic susceptibility of cholera isolates. V. cholerae serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa was isolated from 312 (39%) of 791 stool specimens. All isolates were sensitive to tetracycline, ceftriaxone, cotrimoxazole, gentamycin, and chloramphenicol; 97% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. All isolates had intermediate sensitivity to erythromycin and were resistant to furazolidone and nalidixic acid. Public Health Response Cholera treatment centers were established by Mdecins Sans Frontires and the International Rescue Committee, and active surveillance for cases of acute watery diarrhea was enhanced. A health promotion and hygiene campaign was conducted, primarily through mobilization of community health workers (from 168 during the first few weeks of the outbreak to 286) and hygiene promoters and use of media networks, especially radio. Frequent coordination meetings were held among stakeholders to provide updates and revise recommendations. Water from boreholes was chlorinated, soap was distributed, and bedding and latrine disinfection in affected households was carried out. WASH partners were advised to maintain adequate chlorination levels, install additional tap stands and latrines (especially in unofficial settlement areas), and install additional handwashing facilities in schools, eateries, and marketplaces. Summary What is already known about this topic? Cholera, caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae through ingestion of contaminated food or water, can spread rapidly in densely populated settings such as refugee camps. What is added by this report? During November 18, 2015June 6, 2016, the largest cholera outbreak (1, 797 cases; attack rate 5. 1 per 1, 000) in the history of Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya occurred. Significant risk factors included living in a compound where open defecation, visible human and solid waste, and eating from a shared plate were common. Chlorine levels in water were below standard, and handwashing facilities were insufficient. What are the implications for public health practice? Improvements to water and sanitation, expansion of capacity for community outreach, and enhanced camp security and disease surveillance systems in Dadaab camp and the surrounding area are urgently needed. Discussion Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the toxin secreted during infection with V. cholerae bacterium after inges - tion of contaminated food or water. The infection is frequently mild or asymptomatic; however, approximately 5%10% of infected persons develop severe disease and profuse watery diarrhea. Without prompt treatment, persons with severe disease can die within hours (7) . Cholera outbreaks can spread rapidly in densely populated settings such as refugee camps (8) . Rapid detection and control of cholera outbreaks is a goal for the implementation of the World Health Organizations International Health Regulations and for global health security. This cholera outbreak is the largest reported in Dadaab refugee camp since its establishment in 1992. Existing labo - ratory capacity and effective disease surveillance in the camp facilitated early detection and eventual control of the outbreak. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing confirmed that V. cholerae circulating in the camp was susceptible to antibiotics used in treating patients with severe cholera (9) . All subcamps were affected, but the highest rates occurred in the two largest subcamps. These two areas had poorer water drainage and were in proximity to food markets where persons from areas with active cholera transmission interact. These factors might have contributed to the large number of cases and high attack rates in these areas. Furthermore, in these subcamps, large numbers of housing structures were outside the official boundaries of the camp, in areas that had poorer water and sanitation infrastructure. Inadequate residual chlorine levels in drinking water and the presence of standing Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / August 31, 2018 / V ol. 67 / No. 34 961 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionbodies of water used for swimming and bathing suggest pos - sible waterborne transmission routes. Reported infection of multiple household members and spatial case clustering among residential blocks suggest household transmission or common exposures to a contaminated food or water source. Limited promotion of hygiene messaging during the early weeks of the outbreak could also have increased vulnerability to cholera transmission. Sustained and intensive hygiene pro-motion and WASH interventions in the most affected blocks were also recommended. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita - tions. First, camp insecurity affected case finding and study enrollment, precluding achieving the calculated sample size for the case-control study. Second, other cases of acute watery diarrhea might have been included as cases of suspected cholera, reducing the power of the study. The last reported cholera case in the camp occurred on June 6, 2016, and the outbreak was declared over on June 21, 2016. Thereafter, two small clusters of cases not associated with traveling outside the camp or contact with visitors outside the camp were reported in July (seven cases) and August (five cases) 2016. During AprilAugust 2017, a cholera outbreak involving 511 cases occurred after flooding that destroyed approximately 9, 000 latrines. In September 2017, four cases were reported, and during OctoberDecember 2017, 109 cases were reported. Both outbreaks were controlled immediately with no deaths. Improvements to WASH and disease surveillance are needed to prevent future outbreaks.

Sinatra, DVM1, 2; Kate Colby, MPH2, 3 In July 2017, a woman aged 65 years was evaluated at a hospital emergency department in Maine for an approximately 10-cm area of necrosis on her left lower leg identified as likely skin and soft tissue infection. The patient noted pain in the area that morning and was unable to walk when examined later that day. Computed tomography indicated extensive cellulitis in the area; she was hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics. The Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory identified Vibrio anguillarum from blood cultures collected after admission and before starting treatment; stool and wound cultures were not collected. Approximately 36 hours after she first arrived at the emergency department, the patient developed septic shock and multiorgan failure, dying 2 days after admission. The patient spent the summer in Maine and lived the rest of the year in a southern coastal state. She was in Maine during her exposure period and illness and had reported vomiting and diarrhea 9 days before seeking treatment at the hospital, which had resolved in 1 day, and one additional diarrhea epi - sode the night before admission. Her husband reported that she had eaten a lobster roll from a local restaurant and a cod loin cooked at home approximately 10 days before the onset of leg pain and a lobster and other seafood dip purchased at a grocery store approximately 5 days before onset of leg pain; he could not recall specifically when each of these foods was consumed in relation to the onset of vomiting and diarrhea. None of the seafood was reported to have been raw or under - cooked. The patient had also waded at a beach as recently as the day before seeking treatment, but she did not have any known wounds. Her husband reported that she was bitten by a greenhead fly while at the beach, but the location of the fly bite was not known. A traceback investigation was performed on the seafood she consumed; no informative findings were reported. Her previous medical history included multiple myeloma and amyloidosis, both of which were being treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Vibriosis is an underrecognized and underreported infection caused by species of the family Vibrionaceae other than toxi - genic Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139, which cause cholera (1, 2) . Typically, Vibrionaceae cause gastrointestinal illness with mild to severe watery diarrhea, although they can also cause bacteremia, wound, or extraintestinal infections. The most common trans - mission modes involve consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish or contact with seawater. Persons with liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, thalassemia, or who receive immunosup - pressive therapy are at increased risk for serious infection. In the United States, vibriosis causes an estimated 80, 000 illnesses, 500 hospitalizations, and 100 deaths annually (2) . Vibrio bacteria are gram-negative bacilli naturally found in coastal waters. Their growth and concentration increases with warmer water temperatures, leading to a seasonal distribu - tion of Vibrio infections, with most occurring from summer through early autumn (3) . V. anguillarum (previously known as Listonella anguillarum) is normally a pathogen of fish, crustaceans, and bivalves and causes considerable economic losses in the fishing and aquaculture industries (4) . This is the first reported instance of V. anguillarum associated with human illness. Recent studies report increasing sea surface temperatures in the coastal North Atlantic corresponding with increased abundance and spread of Vibrio bacteria and increased Vibrioassociated illnesses in the United States (5, 6) . Vibriosis is preventable by ensuring that shellfish and seafood are fully cooked before consuming and by either avoiding exposure to seawater when a wound is present or wearing a waterproof dressing and washing wounds after seawater exposure. This immunocom - promised patient had exposures to seafood and seawater. With multiple potential exposures, the source and route of infection could not be determined, but two possibilities based on the available epidemiologic data include 1) exposure of a small wound or the fly bite to contaminated seawater resulting in cellulitis and invasive blood infection, or 2) consumption of seafood contaminated with Vibrio that caused the diarrhea and the subsequent invasive blood infection and cellulitis. In light of this patients comorbidities, determining whether this pathogen was the sole factor in her decline was not feasible, but the case serves as a reminder that laboratories and physi - cians should be aware of the possibility of illness from Vibrio species outside of those commonly observed.

Husten, MD2 In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was given the authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products (1) . Effective August 2016, this authority was extended to all tobacco products, includ - ing electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) (2) . Section 704 (a) (1) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act gives FDA authority to conduct investigations and inspections of manufacturers (i. e. , any person who manufactures, fabricates, assembles, processes, or labels a tobacco product or imports a finished tobacco product for sale or distribution in the United States) to ensure compliance with applicable federal requirements (1, 2) . * In October and November 2016, unannounced inspections were conducted in 59 vape shops to learn about business and manufacturing practices, including whether establishments were retailers or manufacturers, and, among manufacturers, how the products sold were manufactured and whether the manufacturers were aware of FDA regulations regarding tobacco products. This report summarizes these first 59 inspections, which showed a lack of quality assurance programs, standard operating procedures, and full labeling of ingredients by the inspected manufacturers. Vape shops engage in activities that include selling electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), ENDS replacement pieces, and ENDS premixed flavored e-liquids and mixing or prepar - ing combinations of liquid nicotine, flavors, and other liquids for sale to consumers. Before an inspection was initiated, a notice of inspection was issued to the most senior staff mem - ber at the shop, who also received a summary of the findings once the inspection was closed. Sixty establishments in four states were selected; one smoking lounge that did not sell or manufacture products was excluded from subsequent analysis. The 59 inspected shops included 31 retailers that only sold finished products, 27 that were both manufacturers and retailers, and one manufacturer that did not sell to consumers. Personnel at all shops reported being aware of FDA tobacco product regulation. The remainder of this report focuses on the 28 manufacturers. Among the 28 manufacturers, 14 were small businesses employing approximately three persons each; the remaining 14 reported having a parent corporation, a subsidiary, or an * https: //www. fda. gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/default. htm. affiliate company. All 28 manufacturers sold brands of tobacco products made by other manufacturers as well as house brands manufactured on-site in an area away from customers. No assessed manufacturers allowed customers to mix their own products on-site. Among the 28 manufacturers inspected, 25 identified a nicotine concentration on the label of products offered for sale, which ranged from 0100 mg/mL. During the manufacturing process, the assessed manufacturers generally reported using recipes to make products and employed automated pipettes, graduated burettes, or disposable syringes to measure the volumes of liquid, including nicotine, flavoring, propylene glycol, and vegetable glycerin specified in the recipe. Only one manufacturer reported testing the finished products to ensure the product contained the concentration of nicotine indicated on the label. Six establishments indicated that they request testing records from the manufacturers of the branded tobacco products they sold. None of the establishments had quality assurance programs or practices, standard operating procedures, or standardized job training for manufacturing house brands of tobacco products. Workers received on-thejob training and used recipes. This is the first assessment of business and manufacturing practices at vape shops, which have only recently become regulated. Although all vape shops inspected were found to be in compliance with the regulatory requirements of FDA that were in effect at the time of the inspection, the lack of quality assurance programs, standard operating procedures, and full labeling of ingredients by the inspected manufacturers sug - gests that consumers might not receive complete information regarding product contents or purchase products of consistent quality; these concerns might be addressed by future FDA regulatory activities. FDA continues to conduct inspections, which will provide additional information on industry practices and compliance with FDAs regulatory requirements and might inform state and local vape shop policies.
