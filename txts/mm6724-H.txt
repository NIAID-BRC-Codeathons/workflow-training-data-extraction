{"extracted text":"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Weekly / Vol. 67 / No. 24 June 22, 2018 National HIV Testing Day  June 27, 2018 National HIV Testing Day, June 27, highlights the importance of testing in detecting, treating, and prevent - ing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Awareness of HIV infection through HIV testing is the first step to prevention, health care, and social services that improve life quality and length of survival (1) . Health care providers and others providing HIV testing can reduce HIV-related adverse health outcomes and risk for HIV transmission by implementing routine and targeted testing to decrease diagnosis delays (2) . In this issue, an analysis of national population-based survey data collected during 20062016 found that persons with higher risk for HIV in the past year did not achieve CDCs recommended frequency of at least annual screening and the median time between tests did not change (3) . Health care providers and public health practitioners need to intensify efforts to routinely screen all patients for HIV infection, and to identify persons with ongoing risk and ensure that they are engaged in annual screening for HIV infection.

The percentage of persons ever tested and the interval since last test remained largely unchanged during 20062016. More frequent screening of persons with ongoing HIV risk is needed to achieve full implementation of CDCs screening recommendations and to prevent new infections. Integration of routine screening as standard clinical practice through existing strategies, such as electronic medical record prompts (3), or through new, innovative strategies might be needed to increase repeat screening of persons with ongoing risk. In 2006, CDC recommended one-time HIV screening of all persons aged 1364 years and annual rescreening of persons at higher risk for HIV, including persons who inject drugs and their sex partners, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), and hetero - sexual persons who themselves or whose sex partners have had more than one sex partner since their most recent HIV test (1) . In 2017, CDC reiterated this annual screening recommenda - tion for sexually active MSM based on a systematic literature review (4, 5) that found that HIV incidence could be reduced significantly if MSM were screened annually (6, 7) . Despite this recommendation, a recent analysis of National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) and National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data demonstrated that many persons at higher risk are not screened annually and that HIV diagnosis delays persist (2) . Because NHSS data are based on reported diagnoses of HIV and do not include persons who test HIV-negative, and NHBS samples only persons at higher risk for HIV who reside in urban areas, these findings are not generalizable to the entire U. S. population (2) . Population-based surveys such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) can be used to evaluate national HIV screening coverage, but BRFSS and most other population-based surveys lack sufficient information about HIV-related risk behaviors. GSS is a biennial, household-based, multistage probability survey of noninstitutionalized U. S. adults aged 18 years that, since 2006, has included questions about HIV-related risk behaviors and HIV testing.  During 20062016, overall survey response rates ranged from 61. 3% to 71. 4%. In this analysis, respondents were divided into four mutually exclusive HIV risk groups based on self-report of recent HIV-related risk behaviors: 1) men who had a male sex partner in the past 12 months; 2) men who did not have a male sex partner in the past 12 months but had multiple female sex partners, injected drugs, or paid or were paid for sex with a female sex partner in  Time since last HIV test was assessed during the interview by asking respondents for the month and year of their last test. In this analysis, the number of days since last test was estimated by randomly assigning a day in the month of last test and subtracting that date from the date of interview. If the respondent was last tested in the same month as the interview, the number of days since last test was randomly assigned to between 1 and 31 days.  http: //www. gss. norc. org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_AppendixA. pdf.

The first three groups were aggregated and cat - egorized as persons with recent HIV risk. Data collected from the six biennial surveys were aggregated and used to estimate the weighted prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of ever testing for HIV and the median number and interquartile range (IQR) of days since last test, stratified by demographics and HIV risk group. The median number of days since last test was also compared by survey year. Questions about HIV testing and risk behaviors were part of a computer-assisted self-interview module administered to a randomly selected subset of each survey sample. This analysis was limited to respondents who were asked if they were ever tested for HIV infection and provided a yes or no response. All estimates were weighted to account for the multistage sampling design. Among 15, 956 total respondents, 11, 896 (74. 6%) were asked if they had ever tested for HIV. Of these, 208 (1. 7%) pro - vided a response of dont know or refused to answer, yielding an analytic sample of 11, 688 respondents. Overall, 39. 6% had ever tested, and the median estimated time since last test was 1, 080 days or almost 3 years (Table 1) . The percentages ever tested were highest among persons aged 2534 years (54. 4%) and 3544 years (55. 1%), non-Hispanic African American or black (black) persons (57. 4%), and persons with recent HIV risk (62. 2%) . The median estimated number of days since last test was fewest among blacks (534 days), persons aged 1824 years (332 days), persons with an annual household income of <$35, 000 (767 days), and persons with recent HIV risk (512 days) . Among persons with recent HIV risk, the median number of days exceeded 365 days (i. e. , annual screening) in every survey year (Figure), and the percentage ever tested ranged from 60. 0% to 66. 7% across years (data not shown) . The percentage ever tested was highest for men who had a male sex partner (71. 0%) and women with HIV risk in the past 12 months (65. 9%) (Table 2) . Median interval since last test was shorter among persons in all three HIV risk groups (men who had a male sex partner [459 days], other at-risk men [610 days], and women [416 days]) compared with persons with no recent HIV risk (1, 360 days) . Discussion In this analysis, the median estimated interval since last HIV test for persons with recent HIV risk was 512 days (1. 4 years) . Although persons with recent HIV risk were more likely to have ever tested and to have tested more recently than those without recent risk, during 20062016 the median estimated interval since last test remained consistently longer than 1 year for all three risk groups defined in this analysis. Although longer TABLE 1.

These findings suggest that persons with HIV risk in the past year are not testing as frequently as recommended, consistent with findings from NHSS, which reported that the median interval from infection to diagnosis was 2 years for all risk groups (2) . NHBS data from the same report indicated that 71% of MSM but only 41% of heterosexual men and women had tested in the past year. In this analysis, the percentage of all groups with recent HIV risk who tested in the past year was less than 50%, which is comparable to testing estimates among MSM sampled by Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 680 MMWR / June 22, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 24 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionFIGURE.

GSS is the only national population-based survey that provides enough risk information to stratify testing estimates by HIV risk while also providing single-year testing estimates. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, because the proportion of respondents reporting specific HIV-related risk behaviors in the past 12 months (e. g. , injecting drugs) was small, trends in the interval since last test could not be evaluated by individual risk group, which could have obscured meaningful differences between risk groups. Second, self-reported data might be compromised by social desir - ability and recall biases, which might have led to overestimates of testing among persons with HIV risk. Third, because GSS is a household-based survey, important subgroups of persons with recent HIV risk, such as persons who inject drugs or homeless persons, were likely undersampled. Finally, to the extent that Summary What is already known about this topic? CDC recommends routine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening of persons aged 1364 years and annual rescreening of persons at higher risk. Many persons at higher risk are not screened annually. What is added by this report? Analysis of 20062016 national population-based data found that the percentage of persons ever tested and median interval since last test remained unchanged. The median interval since last test among persons with recent HIV risk was shorter than that of other persons tested but exceeded 1 year. What are the implications for public health practice? Efforts to identify persons at higher risk and ensure that they receive annual HIV screening can reduce morbidity, mortality, and transmission to others. Integration of routine screening as standard clinical practice through existing strategies, such as electronic medical record prompts, or new, innovative strategies might be needed to increase repeat screening of persons with ongoing risk. those who answered dont know or refused to answer the HIV testing question were at higher risk for HIV infection and were not being tested frequently, the median interval since last test among persons at risk could have been underestimated. Early diagnosis and effective treatment that suppresses HIV replication not only reduces individual morbidity and mortality but also reduces the risk for transmission to others.  Delayed diagnosis limits the benefits of early treatment initia - tion to minimize immune system damage and prevent HIV transmission. HIV screening is a critical entry point to a range of HIV prevention and treatment options. For persons with ongoing risk for HIV infection, annual screening also offers the opportunity to discuss options to reduce risk, including HIV preexposure prophylaxis. ** Findings from this analysis suggest that HIV screening frequency for persons with recent HIV risk is suboptimal and has not improved substantially  https: //www. cdc. gov/hiv/risk/art/index. html. ** https: //www. cdc. gov/hiv/risk/prep/index. html.

Continuing efforts are needed to achieve full implementation of annual screening recommendations and prevent new infections. It is important that health care provid - ers and public health practitioners intensify efforts to identify persons with ongoing risk and ensure they are engaged in annual screening for HIV infection. Strategies that have been shown to be effective for increasing one-time screening, such as integration of routine screening as standard clinical practice through supportive institutional policy changes, electronic health record prompts, and staff member education (3) could be used to ensure repeat screening for persons with ongoing risk. Expanding access to HIV screening in nonclinical settings and through strategies such as social network strategy, couples HIV testing and counseling,  and home testing can reduce barriers to accessing screening. New, innovative approaches might also be needed to increase repeat screening of persons with ongoing risk.

Miller, PhD2; Sherry Everett Jones, PhD, JD3; Alexis B. Peterson, PhD1; Matthew J. Breiding, PhD1 Increased susceptibility to concussions and longer recovery times among high school athletes compared with older athletes (1) make concussions among youths playing a sport or being physically active an area of concern. Short-term and long-term sequelae of concussions can include cognitive, affective, and behavioral changes (1) . Surveillance methods used to monitor concussions among youths likely underestimate the preva - lence. Estimates assessed from emergency departments miss concussions treated outside hospitals, those generated using high school athletic trainer reports miss concussions sustained outside of school-based sports (2), and both sources miss medically untreated concussions. To estimate the prevalence of concussions among U. S. high school students related to playing a sport or being physically active, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) . Overall, 15. 1% of students (approximately 2. 5 million*) reported having at least one of these concussions during the 12 months before the survey, and 6. 0% reported two or more concussions. Concussion prevalence was significantly higher among male students than among female students and among students who played on a sports team than among students who did not. Among all sex, grade, and racial/ethnic subgroups, the odds of reporting a concussion increased significantly with the number of sports teams on which students played. These findings underscore the need to 1) foster a culture of safety in which concussion prevention and management is explicitly addressed; 2) expand efforts to educate students, parents, coaches, and health care providers regarding the risk for con - cussion; and 3) identify programs, policies, and practices that prevent concussions. YRBS is a biennial, cross-sectional, school-based survey that uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce nationally representative samples of public and private school students in grades 912 (3) . In accordance with local parent permission procedures, students voluntarily completed an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire during one class period and recorded their responses on a computer-scannable answer sheet. An institutional review board at CDC approved the protocol for the national YRBS. In 2017, the school response rate was * The National Center for Education Statistics estimated that in 2017, a total of 16, 451, 000 youths were enrolled in public and private high schools. This number was multiplied by the estimated prevalence of one or more and then two or more concussions related to sports or physical activity found in this study. 75%, the student response rate was 81%, the overall response rate was 60%, and the sample size was 14, 765. In 2017, CDC included a question about concussions on the national YRBS questionnaire for the first time. Following a definition of concussion (when a blow or a jolt to the head causes problems such as headaches, dizziness, being dazed or confused, difficulty remembering or concentrating, vomiting, blurred vision, or being knocked out), students were asked, During the past 12 months, how many times did you have a concussion from playing a sport or being physically active? Response options were: 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, and 4 or more times. Sports team participation was assessed with the question, During the past 12 months, on how many sports teams did you play? (Count any teams run by your school or community groups.) Response options were 0 teams, 1 team, 2 teams, and 3 or more teams. Prevalence estimates were computed overall and by sex (female or male), grade (9, 10, 11, or 12), the number of sports teams on which students played (0, 1, 2, or 3), and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [white], non-Hispanic black [black], or Hispanic) . The number of students in other racial/ethnic subgroups was too small for meaningful analysis. Sampling weights were applied to each student record to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of black and Hispanic students. For all analyses, statistical software was used that took into account the complex sampling design and sampling weights. Chi-square tests were used to identify associations between student characteristics and having had 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 concussions. T-tests were used for pairwise comparisons when a chi-square test result was significant. Among students who played on at least one sports team, the association between the number of teams on which students played and concussion was evaluated for each demographic subgroup using unadjusted logistic regression models. First, number of sports teams was treated as a categorical variable and then, to test for a linear association, as a continuous variable. Overall, 9. 1% of high school students reported one con - cussion, 3. 0% reported two, 1. 0% reported three, and 2. 0% reported four or more concussions related to sports or physi - cal activity during the 12 months before the survey (Table 1) . Thus, 15. 1% of students reported having at least one concus - sion, and 6. 0% reported having two or more. Male students  Overall response rate = school response rate x student response rate.

Students in grades 9, 10, and 11 were more likely to report a single concussion than were students in grade 12, and students in grade 9 were more likely to report a single concussion than were students in grade 10. Black and Hispanic students were more likely to report four or more concussions than were white students. Students who played on at least one sports team were more likely to report one, two, three, and four or more concussions than were those who did not play on any teams. Among students who played on one, two, and three or more sports teams, the prevalence of reporting having had at least one concussion was 16. 7%, 22. 9%, and 30. 3%, respectively (Table 2) . Among students who played on at least one sports team, for all demographic subgroups, the odds of reporting a concussion increased with an increasing number of teams on which students played (Table 3) . Discussion In 2017, an estimated 2. 5 million high school students reported having at least one concussion related to sports or physical activity during the year preceding the YRBS, and an estimated 1. 0 million students reported having two or more concussions during the same time frame. The findings suggest that students who played on a sports team had a significantly higher risk for one or more concussions than did students who did not play on a team. Furthermore, concussions were signifi - cantly more common among students who played on two and three or more sports teams than among those who played on one team. The prevalence of having one or more concussions (15. 1%) is comparable to the findings of an analysis of 2013 YRBS data from three states that added different questions to their survey to assess sports-related concussions among high school athletes. In that study, the prevalence ranged from 17. 6% to 20. 1% (4) . The prevalence of concussions in the current study is higher than estimates based on emergency department data (e. g. , 622. 5 visits per 100, 000 population aged 1014 years) (5) and athletic trainer reports (e. g. , 1. 8 per 100 high school and college athletes for an average season) (6) . Emergency department data miss concussions treated else - where, and athletic trainer reports miss concussions sustained outside of school-based sports; both sources miss medically untreated concussions (2) .

Although increased awareness and recognition might result in higher rates of reported concussions (1), underreporting of concussions among athletes remains an important issue. A study of high school athletes found that among athletes with concussions, 40% reported that their coach was unaware of their symptoms (7) . Students might not always recognize or remember that they have experienced a concussion, or they might not want to report having experienced a concussion. In this study, the opportunity to anonymously self-report a concussion, without negative consequences, such as a loss of playing time, might have aided in including concussions missed by other data sources. However, this study might overestimate the prevalence of concussions related to sports or physical activity if students reported concussions occurring before the 12-month reference period (8) or mistakenly thought that they had a concussion because some symptoms of a concussion, such as a headache, also occur in the absence of a concussion (9) . The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, these concussions, self-reported by students, were not validated (e. g. , through medical record review) . Second, these data apply only to high school students who attend school and are not representative of all youths in this age group or in other age groups. Nationwide, in 2013, approximately 5% of persons aged 1617 years were not enrolled in high school and lacked a high school credential.  Third, continuing to play sports or be physically active with a concussion that is symptomatic increases the risk for a subsequent, more seri - ous concussion (10) . YRBS data found that 6% of students  https: //nces. ed. gov/pubs2016/2016117rev. pdf. Summary What is already known about this topic? A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury. Surveillance efforts likely miss some concussions related to sports and physical activity among youths. What is added by this report? The 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that 15. 1% of students reported having at least one concussion related to sports or physical activity, and 6. 0% reported having two or more. Playing on more than one sports team was found to further increase the risk for concussion. What are the implications for public health practice? It is important to expand education about the risk for concussion, the signs and symptoms of concussion, the need to remove athletes with a suspected concussion from play, the evaluation of concussions, and the protocol for athletes safe return to school and play. reported two or more concussions, but YRBS data do not allow for determining the proportion of concussions that might have been related to a previous concussion that had not fully healed. Finally, it is not known what proportion of concussions occurred during team sports participation versus other types of physical activity. A 2014 National Academy of Sciences report concluded that, in light of the limitations of existing surveillance systems, more comprehensive estimates of youth sports concussions are needed (1) . This study, and state-level YRBS data (4), support this conclusion by suggesting that many concussions among Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 22, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 24 685 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE 3.

Logistic regression models tested a linear association between the number of sports teams on which students played and the odds of reporting having a concussion from playing a sport or being physically active. youths are not being counted and might also indicate that similar comprehensive estimates below the high school level are needed. To that end, CDC is working toward developing a National Concussion Surveillance System to determine the incidence and identify the circumstances of concussions, and all traumatic brain injuries, across the lifespan (2) . The findings in this report support the need to continue education efforts addressing concussion risk associated with sports and physical activity, and indicate a need for messaging targeted toward students who play on multiple sports teams. Additionally, black and Hispanic students were more likely to report four or more concussions than were white students; targeted messaging might be needed to educate these groups in particular about the risks associated with sustaining multiple concussions. In addition, coaches and parents can encour - age athletes to follow the rules of play for their sport with an emphasis on player safety, which might reduce the incidence and severity of concussions (1, 10) . It is important that any athlete with a suspected concussion be removed from practice and competition and not return to play without the clearance of a health care provider (10) . Continuing to play with a concussion might worsen symptoms (1) and increase the risk for a second concussion; therefore, it is crucial to talk with athletes about the importance of reporting their concussion symptoms (10) . Among recreational activities, bicycle helmets have been shown to reduce head injuries (1) . There is a need to expand programs, policies, and practices, tailored to specific audiences, to ensure that all students, parents, coaches, teach-ers, and health care providers know how to prevent, recognize, and manage concussions. It is critical that these stakeholders know how to safely return students to school and to play fol - lowing a concussion.

Wang, PhD1; Michael A. Tynan1; Cynthia Hallett, MPH2; Laura Walpert, JD2; Maggie Hopkins2; Darryl Konter1; Brian A. King, PhD1 Each year in the United States, cigarette smoking causes an estimated 480, 000 deaths, including approximately 41, 000 deaths from secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmok - ing adults (1) . Smoke-free policies protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke exposure, reduce the social acceptability of smoking, help in preventing youth and young adult smoking initiation, and increase smokers efforts to quit smoking (1, 2) . Given that 99% of adult cigarette smokers first start smoking before age 26 years and many smokers transition to regular, daily use during young adulthood (2), * colleges and universities represent an important venue for protecting students, faculty, staff members, and guests from secondhand smoke exposure through tobacco control policies (3) . To assess smoke-free and tobacco-free policies in U. S. colleges and universities, CDC and the American Nonsmokers Rights Foundation (ANRF) determined the number of campuses nationwide that com-pletely prohibit smoking (smoke-free) or both smoking and smokeless tobacco product use (tobacco-free) in all indoor and outdoor areas. As of November 2017, at least 2, 082 U. S. college and university campuses had smoke-free policies. Among these campuses, 1, 743 (83. 7%) were tobacco-free; 1, 658 (79. 6%) specifically prohibited electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use; and 854 (41. 0%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Smoke-free and tobacco-free policies on college and university cam - puses can help reduce secondhand smoke exposure, tobacco use initiation, and the social acceptability of tobacco use (13) . Data on smoke-free and tobacco-free policies enacted as of November 2017 were obtained from ANRFs College Campus Tobacco Policy Database,  the only national repository of tobacco restrictions on college campuses in the United States. The database is compiled using a daily news digest from Internet searches, as well as direct communication with state and local health departments, university officials, students, and alumni.  The policies then are analyzed using standardized criteria and entered into the database. Campuses eligible for consideration are located in all 50 U. S. states, the District of Columbia, commonwealths, territories, and in tribal entities. * https: //www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/books/n/nap18997/pdf.  https: //no-smoke. org/colleges-universities-list-criteria/.  Information on school policies is also gathered by ANRF program personnel providing technical assistance in this area. Details are confirmed by reviewing a copy of the final policy, either on the institutions website or via an institution contact with access to the policy documentation. College and university campuses were considered smoke-free if they completely prohibited smoking in all indoor and out - door areas, and tobacco-free if they prohibited both smoking and smokeless tobacco product use in all indoor and outdoor areas.  In addition, those that explicitly prohibited use of e-cigarettes and hookah smoking were also assessed. ** For institutions comprising multiple physical learning sites with or without distinct policies, each site was evaluated as a separate campus. Campuses without smoke-free or tobacco-free poli - cies were not included in the database, and data on the total number of U. S. college and university campuses as defined in the context of this report were unavailable. Therefore, it was not possible to summarize the number of smoke-free campuses as a percentage of total U. S. campuses. Findings were reported overall and by state and campus type (public; private; com - munity college; historically black college or university; and tribal) .  Campus type categories were not mutually exclusive, and campuses could be categorized as multiple types. As of November 2017, at least 2, 082 U. S. college and university campuses were smoke-free (Table 1) . Among these campuses, 1, 743 (83. 7%) were tobacco-free; 1, 658 (79. 6%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and 854 (41. 0%) specifi - cally prohibited hookah smoking.  For smoke-free campuses, the law or institutional policy prohibits smoking of combustible tobacco products on the entire campus property, both indoors and out, including remote parking lots, stadiums, theater performances, and residential housing (where applicable) . For tobacco-free campuses, the law or institutional policy prohibits smoking of combustible tobacco products and the use of smokeless tobacco products on the entire campus property, both indoors and out, including remote parking lots, stadiums, theater performances, and residential housing (where applicable) . The only possible exemptions for smoke-free and tobacco-free campuses include ones personal vehicle, research in a controlled lab setting, or religious ceremonial purposes. ** Coverage of hookah smoking is not consistently addressed under smoke-free policies for college or university campuses. Therefore, subsequent analyses determined the proportion of smoke-free policies that contain language specifically prohibiting hookah (e. g. hookah, shisha, or water pipe) use anywhere on campus.  A public college or university was defined as a campus funded b y government means. A private college or university was defined as a campus not funded by government means. A community college was defined as a campus with community college in the name or that described itself as one in the documentation encountered during analysis, confirmed via a reliable source familiar with the entity or via Internet research. A historically black college or university was defined as a campus that described itself as one in the documentation encountered during analysis, confirmed via a reliable source familiar with the entity, or via Internet research. A tribal college or university was defined as a campus on American Indian/Alaska Native sovereign land.

Among the 448 private campuses with smoke-free policies, 350 (78. 1%) were tobacco-free; 282 (63. 2%) specifi - cally prohibited e-cigarette use; and 159 (35. 5%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Among the 1, 209 community college campuses with smoke-free policies, 1, 066 (88. 2%) were tobacco-free; 1, 018 (84. 2%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and 459 (38. 0%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Among the 58 historically black college or university campuses with smoke-free policies, 42 (72. 4%) were tobacco-free; 37 (63. 8%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and 28 (48. 3%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. Among the 18 tribal campuses with smoke-free policies, all 18 were tobacco-free; two (11. 1%) specifically prohibited e-cigarette use; and three (16. 7%) specifically prohibited hookah smoking. By state or territory, the number of college and university campuses with a smoke-free policy ranged from one in Hawaii and the Northern Mariana Islands to 108 in California and North Carolina (Table 2) . Discussion In September 2012, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, the University of Michigan, and the American College Health Association collaboratively launched the Tobacco-Free College Campus Initiative to promote and support the voluntary adoption and implementation of tobacco-free policies at universities, colleges, and other institu - tions of higher learning across the United States. At the time, 774 colleges and universities were identified as having a smoke-free campus policy, 562 (72. 6%) of which were tobacco-free.  The findings from this study indicate that, as of November 2017, the number of campuses with smoke-free or tobacco-free policies had risen to 2, 082 and 1, 743, respectively, suggesting that the number of U. S. college and university campuses with such policies has more than doubled over the past half-decade. Smoke-free and tobacco-free policies at colleges and universi - ties can help reduce secondhand smoke exposure, tobacco use initiation, and the social acceptability of tobacco use (13) . These results include campuses that might be smoke-free or tobacco-free because of policies at the institutional, local, state, or territorial levels. Healthy People 2020 objective TU-13. 17 monitors the number of states and the District of Columbia that have enacted laws that prohibit smoking on college and university campuses.  As of 2017, four states (Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, and Louisiana) and the Northern Mariana Islands have enacted laws requiring smoke-free policies that prohibit smoking in all indoor and outdoor areas of public col - lege campuses (4, 5) . Among these smoke-free laws, Arkansass law specifically prohibits e-cigarettes, Illinoiss law specifically prohibits e-cigarettes and hookahs, and the Northern Mariana Islands law specifically prohibits e-cigarettes and smokeless  http: //no-smoke. org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/smokefreecollegesuniversitiesJul-1-2012. pdf.  http: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/tobacco-use/objectives.

In 2015, approximately 40% of U. S. adults aged 1824 years (12. 6 million) were enrolled in 4, 562 degree-granting post-secondary institutions (6),  and a substantial proportion of young adults currently use at least one tobacco product: in 2015, one in five adults aged 1824 years (21. 4%) reported using a tobacco product some days or every day (7) . Moreover, 23. 8% of adults who attained some college education, but received no diploma, reported current use of at least one tobacco product (7) .  Includes only institutions reporting enrollment data in Fall 2015. The number of degree-granting postsecondary institutions reported by the National Center for Education Statistics is not directly comparable to the number of smoke-free campuses identified in this report. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 22, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 24 689 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Cigarette smoking causes an estimated 480, 000 U. S. deaths annually, including 41, 000 from secondhand smoke exposure. Nearly all adult cigarette smokers start smoking before age 26 years, making smoke-free and tobacco-free policies at colleges and universities important. What is added by this report? As of November 2017, at least 2, 082 U. S. colleges and universities had smoke-free policies, twice as many as in 2012. Among these campuses, 1, 743 (83. 7%) had tobacco-free policies and some specifically prohibited electronic cigarette use (1, 658 [79. 6%]) and hookah smoking (854 [41. 0%]) . What are the implications for public health practice? Efforts to monitor, promote, implement, and enforce smokefree and tobacco-free policies in U. S. colleges and universities can help reduce the prevalence of tobacco product use and secondhand smoke exposure among those who learn, live, work, and gather in these environments. Given the trajectories of tobacco product use and initiation among young adults, interventions targeted toward this popula - tion, including tobacco-free and smoke-free policies in colleges and universities, might help accelerate efforts to reduce tobacco product use among young persons (1, 2) . This study is subject to at least four limitations. First, these data might include policies that have been formally adopted but are not yet in effect. Second, whereas ANRFs database is the only national repository of smoke-free campus policies, these policies are not collected systematically from all campuses in the United States and therefore might not contain all policies that currently exist. Third, ANRFs database does not capture the total number of U. S. college and university campuses; comparable data would be needed to present the percentage of U. S. campuses with smoke-free or tobacco-free policies and to estimate the percentage of students protected. Finally, there is no uniform method for ascertaining how rigorously these policies are enforced. Previous research suggests that although tobacco-free campuses have increased in recent years, policy restrictiveness, implementation, and enforcement vary (8) . The U. S. Surgeon General has concluded that there is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke (9), and the public health benefits of smoke-free policies are well established in the sci-entific literature (1) . Smoke-free and tobacco-free campuses can promote the health and well-being of a diverse intersection of students, faculty, staff members, and guests by protecting nonusers from the harmful effects of secondhand tobacco product emissions, reducing the social acceptability of tobacco product use, preventing tobacco use initiation, and promot - ing cessation (1, 2, 9) . Continued efforts to monitor, promote, implement, and enforce smoke-free and tobacco-free policies in U. S. colleges and universities, in coordination with continued implementation of proven population-based interventions and tobacco product regulation (10), can help reduce the burden of tobacco product use among those who learn, live, work, and gather in these environments (1, 2, 9) .

Burns, PhD5; Derek Ehrhardt, MPH, MSN1; Magdi Sharaf, MD2 Since the 1988 inception of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), progress toward interruption of wild polio - virus (WPV) transmission has occurred mostly through exten - sive use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in mass vaccination campaigns and through routine immunization services (1, 2) . However, because OPV contains live, attenuated virus, it car - ries the rare risk for reversion to neurovirulence. In areas with very low OPV coverage, prolonged transmission of vaccine-associated viruses can lead to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), which can cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis. Although WPV type 2 has not been detected since 1999, and was declared eradicated in 2015, * most VDPV outbreaks have been attributable to VDPV serotype 2 (VDPV2) (3, 4) . After the synchronized global switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV) (containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV) (types 1 and 3) in April 2016 (5), GPEI regards any VDPV2 emergence as a public health emergency (6, 7) . During MayJune 2017, VDPV2 was isolated from stool specimens from two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Deir-ez-Zor governorate, Syria. The first isolate differed from Sabin vaccine virus by 22 nucleotides in the VP1 coding region (903 nucleotides) . Genetic sequence analysis linked the two cases, confirming an outbreak of cir - culating VDPV2 (cVDPV2) . Poliovirus surveillance activities were intensified, and three rounds of vaccination campaigns, aimed at children aged <5 years, were conducted using monova - lent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) . During the outbreak, 74 cVDPV2 cases were identified; the most recent occurred in September 2017. Evidence indicates that enhanced surveillance measures coupled with vaccination activities using mOPV2 have inter - rupted cVDPV2 transmission in Syria. Context for VDPV2 Emergence in Syria The ongoing civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, has had a deleterious impact on its health care system, leading to a steep decline in routine vaccination coverage and population immunity. Before the war (during 20012010), national 3-dose OPV (OPV3) coverage estimates by age 1 year consistently * http: //polioeradication. org/news-post/global-eradication-of-wild-poliovirustype-2-declared/. exceeded 80%. By 2016, estimated OPV3 coverage had decreased from 83% in 2010 to 48% (8) . Multiple rounds of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), implemented in response to a WPV outbreak during 20132014 (9), mitigated the poor quality of routine immuni - zation services in parts of the country; however, the frequency and quality of these activities lessened after the outbreak was declared over. In 2016, the year after the response to the WPV outbreak officially concluded, six SIAs were conducted in Deir-ez-Zor governorate; two used tOPV, with reported administrative coverage  of 7% and 23%. The vaccination status of patients aged 659 months with nonpolio AFP (NPAFP) can be used as a proxy for OPV vac - cination coverage. Among children born during the war, the estimated proportion of unvaccinated children with NPAFP increased from 3% in 2015 to 6% nationally by the end of 2016. In Deir-ez-Zor governorate, the proportion of children aged 659 months with NPAFP who had not received OPV rose from 0% in 2015 to 10% in 2016, coinciding with a decline in SIA quality in the governorate. Intermittent bans on vaccination campaigns were also imposed by local authorities in control of the governorate during this period. Detection of poliovirus circulation depends on prompt identification and investigation of AFP cases. During 20162017, national NPAFP rates (assessing surveillance sensitivity) and the proportion of adequate stool specimens collected from AFP patients (assessing quality of case investigation) exceeded the performance targets of 2 cases per 100, 000 persons aged <15 years and 80%, respectively. However, subnational AFP surveillance gaps were noted for both indicators; the propor - tion of AFP cases in Deir-ez-Zor governorate with adequate stool specimens declined from 84% in 2015 to 61% in 2016. Outbreak Epidemiology The earliest identified cVDPV2 outbreak case occurred in a girl aged 22 months from Mayadeen district, Deir-ez-Zor gov - ernorate, (paralysis onset March 3, 2017) and the most recent occurred in an infant aged 5 months from Boukamal district, Deir-ez-Zor governorate (paralysis onset September 21, 2017) .  Administrative vaccination coverage is obtained by dividing the total number of vaccine doses administered by the estimated target population group. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 22, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 24 691 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe cVDPV2 isolate identified in the index case differed from Sabin vaccine virus by 22 nucleotides in the VP1 coding region (903 nucleotides) . Among 74 cases reported as of June 17, 2018 (Figure 1) (Figure 2), 46 (62%) occurred in females. The median patient age was 15 months, with 26 (35%) aged <12 months, 35 (47%) aged 1223 months, 11 (15%) aged 2459 months, and two (3%) aged 5 years. Thirty cases (41%) occurred in children who had never received a dose of OPV, 32 (43%) in 12 dose recipients, and 12 (16%) in children who had received 3 OPV doses. Geographically, 71 (96%) cases were reported from Deir-ez-Zor governorate, including 58 (78%) from Mayadeen district, 12 (16%) from Boukamal district, and one (1%) from Deir-ez-Zor district. The three remaining cases were reported (one case each) from Tell Abyad and Thawra districts in Raqqa governorate and Tadmour district in Homs governorate, which borders Mayadeen district, the epicenter of both the current cVDPV2 and the 20132014 WPV outbreaks. Outbreak Response Activities Active searches for AFP cases were intensified in districts reporting cVDPV2 cases and in surrounding areas. AFP cases were promptly investigated, and stool specimens were also collected from close patient contacts for testing; the cVDPV2 cases in Raqqa governorate were confirmed through the testing of stool specimens obtained from contacts. In addition, stool specimens were collected from healthy children in affected areas of Deir-ez-Zor governorate and from children arriving in other governorates from outbreak-affected areas. To facilitate early detection of poliovirus circulation, six environmental surveil - lance sites were established in five governorates (Deir-ez-Zor, Raqqa, Homs, Damascus, and Aleppo) beginning in December 2017. To date, no cVDPV2 has been isolated from sewage samples collected from these sites. In response to the outbreak, SIAs were implemented in two distinct phases (Table) . The first phase took place from July to October 2017, during which time two mOPV2 vac - cination campaigns were conducted, targeting children aged <5 years in Deir-ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was also administered to children aged 223 months in both governorates during the second mOPV2 round, except in Tell Abyad district of Raqqa gover - norate. In Deir-ez-Zor governorate, the first mOPV2 vacci-nation campaign was implemented during July 2227, 2017. Based on administrative data, approximately 79% of 328, 000 targeted children were vaccinated, whereas estimated cover-age from postcampaign monitoring data (based on parental recall) was 88%. The second mOPV2 vaccination campaign in Deir-ez-Zor governorate, which was held 1 month later, achieved an estimated 77% administrative and postcampaign FIGURE 1.

In Raqqa governorate, the commence - ment of both mOPV2 campaigns was delayed because of pro - tracted negotiations with multiple local authorities in control of different parts of the governorate. The first mOPV2 vaccina - tion campaign was implemented during August 1218, 2017. Although administrative data indicated that 86% of 120, 000 targeted children were vaccinated, postcampaign monitoring estimated coverage at only 57%. Administrative vaccination coverage was 114% after the second mOPV2 vaccination campaign in Raqqa, implemented in early October 2017; however, estimated coverage from postcampaign monitoring data was 84%. In January 2018, the second phase of response vaccina - tion activities was initiated because of evidence of ongoing cVDPV2 transmission after the first phase of vaccination activities in Deir-ez-Zor governorate. A third mOPV2 vac-cination campaign was implemented in Deir-ez-Zor, Raqqa, and Hasakeh governorates as well as in Tadmour district of Homs governorate. IPV was also administered to children aged 223 months among groups at high risk in Damascus, Aleppo, and Hasakeh governorates during a separate round of vaccination activities in February 2018. Estimated mOPV2 coverage based on postcampaign monitoring ranged from 84% in Raqqa governorate to 91% in Hasakeh governorate. Fewer than 1, 000 children were vaccinated in the sparsely populated district of Tadmour in Homs governorate. Whereas estimat - ing the target population of eligible children in Tadmour district was challenging because of population migration, the number of children vaccinated was seen as reflective of those present in the governorate at the time of the campaign. IPV was also administered to internally displaced children in Syria throughout the second half of 2017, as well as to refugees and groups at high risk in neighboring communities in Lebanon, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 692 MMWR / June 22, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 24 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionFIGURE 2.

In line with GPEI protocol for containment of type 2 polio - viruses, a principal focus of the response was ensuring proper management and disposal of mOPV2 vaccine vials. Nearly all mOPV2 vaccine vials were successfully retrieved at the end of each round of vaccination activities. Unused vials were returned to national stockpiles, whereas partially used or empty vials were consolidated and destroyed at designated locations. Another cru - cial element of the response was the tailoring of social mobiliza - tion and communication strategies to foster positive perceptions of vaccines while dispelling misconceptions. Discussion A longstanding humanitarian crisis precipitated by war and political unrest has left much of Syrias population vulner - able to recurrent disease outbreaks (10) . The 2017 cVDPV2 outbreak followed a WPV outbreak during 20132014 and occurred against the backdrop of declining routine vaccination coverage since the onset of the war (8) and the poor quality of tOPV SIAs implemented in conflict-affected areas such as Deir-ez-Zor before the 2016 global tOPV-to-bOPV switch. Given VDPVs propensity for emerging in settings of low OPV coverage, the worsening poliovirus type 2 immunity profile among children in Deir-ez-Zor governorate created Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 22, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 24 693 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTABLE.

These denominators might not have reflected the actual target population because of frequent population movement to and from the outbreak-affected area.  Postcampaign monitoring is often considered a more accurate measure of vaccination coverage than administrative data and was estimated using cluster and market surveys administered by independent monitors to parents of children within the target age group. Although no case was identified in Hasakeh governorate, it was included in response activities because of its geographic proximity to the outbreak-affected area. the conditions for emergence and rapid spread of VDPV2 within the governorate. According to genomic sequence analysis, the viral strain responsible for the outbreak differed by 22 nucleotides from Sabin vaccine virus and was circulat - ing for approximately a year before isolation of VDPV2 in the index case. The delay in detecting circulation of the virus could have contributed to the size and scope of the outbreak, one of the largest documented cVDPV2 outbreaks. Subnational gaps in AFP surveillance performance, as well as delays in receiv - ing laboratory results because of difficulties transporting stool specimens, occasioned by the complex humanitarian emer - gency, contributed to the inability to detect the outbreak earlier. Despite immense operational and security constraints, the response by the Syrian national polio eradication program to the outbreak appears to have been effective. Evidence indicates that institution of environmental sewage sampling to supple-ment intensified AFP surveillance activities and vaccination campaigns with mOPV2 successfully interrupted the transmis - sion of cVDPV2 in Syria.

Conflict of Interest No conflicts of interest were reported. Summary What is already known about this topic? Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) contains live attenuated viruses, which rarely revert to neurovirulence. These vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) tend to emerge in populations with low OPV coverage and are capable of causing paralysis. What is added by this report? In 2017, an outbreak of circulating VDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) occurred in Syria, causing 74 cases. Implementation of three rounds of monovalent OPV type 2 campaigns coupled with intensified surveillance interrupted the outbreak. What are the implications for public health practice? The outbreak in Syria underscores the risk for emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses in settings of low OPV coverage. High-quality surveillance and targeted vaccination using monovalent OPV type 2 are effective in controlling cVDPV2 outbreaks. 1Global Immunization Division, Center for Global Health, CDC; 2Polio Eradication Department, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland; 3Middle East and North Africa Office, United Nations Childrens Fund, Amman, Jordan; 4Division of Global Health Protection, Center for Global Health, CDC; 5Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC; 6Syria Country Office, United Nations Childrens Fund, Damascus, Syria.
