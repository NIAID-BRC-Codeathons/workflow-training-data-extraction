U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNational Preparedness Month  September 2018 Each September, CDC, along with 3, 000 global, national, regional, and local governments, as well as pri - vate and public health institutions, supports emergency preparedness efforts and encourages U. S. residents to take action before, during, and after an emergency. Every com - munity in the United States needs to be ready to respond to an infectious disease outbreak, a chemical or radiologic release, or a natural disaster (1) . Public health systems need the capacity to scale up and respond to emergencies (2) . This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which resulted in an estimated 50 to 100 million deaths (3) . Planning and preparedness for all types of public health emergencies are vital to keeping communities safe. This year, CDC is highlighting four areas: 1) personal preparedness, 2) pandemic planning, 3) policy and partner - ships, and 4) public health response. Personal preparedness helps communities to be more resilient in the event of an emergency. Through pandemic planning, CDC works to protect the nation from seasonal and pandemic influenza, and through partnerships, CDC plays a pivotal role in state and local readiness. CDCs Emergency Operations Center and the Division of State and Local Readiness bring together experts and state-of-the-art technology to detect and respond to pub - lic health emergencies, such as the recent Zika virus outbreak featured in this issue of MMWR (4) .

CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21, 2016, with seven task forces to support the national response. The State Coordination Task Force, which functions as a liaison between jurisdictions and federal operations during a response, coordinated the development of CDC Guidelines for Development of State and Local Risk-based Zika Action Plans, which included a Zika Preparedness Checklist (1) . The check - list summarized recommendations covering topics from the seven task forces. In July 2016, CDCs Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR) awarded $25 million in supplemental funding to 53 jurisdictions (41 states, eight Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report970 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe MMWR series of publications is published by the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.

In December 2016, CDC awarded an additional $25 million to 21 of the 53 jurisdictions at the greatest risk for seeing Zika in their communities based on the presence of the mosquito responsible for spreading Zika, history of local transmission, or a high volume of travelers from Zika-affected areas. The additional $25 million was part of the $350 million in Zika supplemental funding provided to CDC by Congress in 2016* (2, 3) . Funded jurisdictions reported progress through the checklist at five quarterly points throughout the response. Data were analyzed to assess planning and response activities. Among the 53 jurisdictions, the per - centage that reported having a Zika virus readiness, response, and recovery plan increased from 26% in June 2016 to 64% in July 2017. Overall, Zika planning and response activities increased among jurisdictions from June 2016 to July 2017. The recent Zika virus outbreak underscores the importance of strengthening state, local, and territorial health department capacity for rapid response to emerging threats. * The other funds were distributed for Zika efforts via other means. For example, CDC awarded nearly $97 million to 58 state, territorial, city, and local public health departments through the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases Cooperative Agreement; $8 million to 38 state, territorial, and local jurisdictions for Zika birth defects surveillance activities; $40 million to four universities to establish vectorborne disease regional centers of excellence; and $14 million to the Puerto Rico Science, Technology, and Research T rust to oversee the first vector control unit in Puerto Rico. https: //www. cdc. gov/ phpr/readiness/funding-zika. htm; https: //www. cdc. gov/media/releases/2016/ p1222-zika-funding. html. Jurisdictions selected to receive supplemental funding for Zika preparedness and response were chosen based on the estimated geographic range of the two mosquito vectors known to carry and likely transmit Zika virus (i. e. , Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti) in the United States in 2016 (3) . Funded jurisdictions included 41 states, eight territories (American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and U. S. Virgin Islands) and four local jurisdictions (Chicago, Los Angeles County, New York City, and the District of Columbia) . In April 2016, the Zika Preparedness Guidance document, based on the CDC guidelines (1), was distributed from the State Coordination Task Force to state, local, and ter - ritorial health departments preparing to respond to potential Zika virus transmission; funded jurisdictions were required to complete the checklist. Health department staff members were expected to address elements in the CDC guidelines, and they  Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  Other jurisdictions, including nine states, not receiving funding were not asked to provide any information on the checklist or progress on Zika-related activities. Although these other jurisdictions did not have mosquitoes capable of transmitting Zika virus and therefore were not selected to receive the supplemental funding, cases of Zika acquired during travel could be identified in any location. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 971 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwere required to submit quarterly progress on the checklist based on whether they 1) had fully completed the actions listed; 2) had begun the actions, but had not fully implemented or completed the actions; 3) had not started the actions; or 4) did not answer because the guidance element was not applicable to their jurisdiction. Data were collected at baseline in June 2016 and at the end of each quarter in October 2016, January 2017, April 2017, and July 2017. The checklist divided the Zika response into four phases to reflect the burden and intensity of risk for Zika virus transmis - sion. The pre-incident stage included phase 0 (preparedness) and phase 1 (mosquito season, but no local transmission) . Phase 2 was defined by confirmed local transmission, and phase 3 by con - firmed local multiperson transmission. Respondents completed up to 112 questions depending on the presence of capable vectors and the extent of local transmission. Questions were aggregated within the following seven activity domains: 1) operations and planning, 2) communications and community education, 3) vec - tor control, 4) surveillance, 5) laboratory testing, 6) outreach to pregnant women, and 7) blood safety. For each reporting period, the number and percentage of jurisdictions reporting activity on 85% of the guidance elements (selected as the minimum indicator of Zika preparedness) was determined. Jurisdictions with multiple confirmed cases of local mos - quitoborne transmission of Zika virus increased from three in June 2016 to seven in July 2017 (Table 1) . By October 2016, all jurisdictions were reporting cases (mostly travel-related, except in the territories, where endemic transmission was occurring) during their respective mosquito seasons and pro - vided responses to all guidance elements through phase 1. Ten jurisdictions provided responses for elements in phases 2 and 3. During phases 0 and 1, the percentage of 53 jurisdictions reporting activity on 85% of the guidance elements ranged from 77% (operations and planning) to 98% (communica - tions and community education and outreach to pregnant women) (Table 2) . During phases 2 and 3, the percentage of 10 jurisdictions reporting activity on 85% of the guidance elements ranged from 71% (vector control and outreach to pregnant women) to 100% (operations and planning, surveil - lance, laboratory testing, and blood safety) . Jurisdictions reporting development of Zika virus readiness, response, and recovery plans increased from 14 (26%) in June 2016 to 34 (64%) in July 2017 (Table 3) . There was an increase in the number of jurisdictions reporting updated training and educational materials for pregnant women (outreach to preg - nant women domain; from 24 [45%] to 46 [87%]), publicizing travel guidance (communications and community education domain; from 31 [58%] to 51 [96%]), and developing state action plan for vector control (vector control domain; from 17 [32%] to 30 [57%]) . Among the seven jurisdictions experiencing local transmis - sion in July 2017 (American Samoa, Florida, Federated States of Micronesia, Puerto Rico, Marshall Islands, Texas, and the U. S. Virgin Islands), five monitored effectiveness of vector control treatments through trapping and re-treating if mos - quito numbers began to increase again (vector control), and five had laboratory testing staff members and surge reagents in place (laboratory testing) . Similarly, six of the seven jurisdic - tions developed community outreach plans to prevent sexual transmission (communications and community education), expanded vector control efforts within areas of local transmis - sion (vector control), expanded surveillance and monitoring of pregnant women (surveillance), developed procedures to follow up with Zika positive blood donors (blood safety), and identified geographic areas for aggressive response efforts (operations and planning) .

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 972 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDiscussion Since May 2015, CDC has responded to reports of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes associated with Zika virus infec - tion during pregnancy. Collaboration with jurisdictions about case reports, surveillance, and registry data facilitated surveil - lance and increased knowledge about the impact of Zika virus infection on pregnant women and their fetuses and infants. According to CDC U. S. Zika Pregnancy Registry data since 2016, among women in the United States who had laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy, 6%11% of fetuses or infants had evidence of Zika-associated birth defects (4); among women in the U. S. territories who had laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection dur - ing pregnancy, 4%8% of fetuses or infants had birth defects potentially related to Zika virus (5) . The quarterly Zika preparedness assessments facilitated active monitoring of progress toward Zika preparedness and response activities in 53 jurisdictions and provided situational awareness among internal and external partners, including the Zika response leadership, professional health care associations, nonprofit organizations, academic and research institutions, and the private sector. The checklist documented that health departments prepared for and implemented strategies to reduce the transmission of Zika virus. From June 2016 to July 2017, TABLE 2.

The largest reported increases were in the following domains: operations and planning, communications and community education, outreach to pregnant women, and blood safety. The Zika supplemental funding, along with the funding provided through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative agreement, supports public health preparedness infrastructure to respond to large-scale emerging public health threats (6) . The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the data were collected through quarterly assessments. Second, the data represent self-reported progress on broad Zika Preparedness Guidance elements rather than objectively reviewed specific performance measures. A more detailed assessment ascertained by independent evaluators could potentially facilitate better planning and response actions in future outbreaks. The quarterly assessment findings provide objective evidence of progress toward meeting Zika planning and preparedness goals among the 53 jurisdictions receiving supplemental funding. As a result, the preparedness plans and strategies to reduce transmission and adverse effects of Zika in these jurisdictions improved compared with those in June 2016. CDC collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments strengthened the response to this emerging threat and demonstrated the ability of public health departments to prepare and respond to an emerging public health event.

Zika virus infection can cause adverse pregnancy-related birth defects and brain abnormalities. Local transmission of Zika virus was documented in the United States and its territories after the spread of Zika virus in the World Health Organizations Region of the Americas. What is added by this report? Among 53 jurisdictions, Zika planning and response activities increased from June 2016 to July 2017, with the largest increases in percentage of jurisdictions reporting fully com - pleted actions for the operations and planning, communica - tions and community education, outreach to pregnant women, and blood safety domains. What are the implications for public health practice? Zika planning, preparedness, and response activities from June 2016 to July 2017 demonstrated the importance of collabora - tion between CDC and U. S. state, local, and territorial public health departments in preparation for and response to an emerging event. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 974 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionVital Signs: State-Level Variation in Nonfatal and Fatal Cardiovascular Events Targeted for Prevention by Million Hearts 2022 Matthew D. Ritchey, DPT1; Hilary K. Wall, MPH1; Pamela L. Owens, PhD2; Janet S. Wright, MD1 Abstract Introduction: Despite its preventability, cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States. This study describes the burden, in 2016, of nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events targeted for prevention by Million Hearts 2022, a national initiative working to prevent one million cardiovascular events during 20172021. Methods: Emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations were identified using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases, and deaths were identified using National Vital Statistics System data. Age-standardized Million Heartspreventable event rates and hospitalization costs among adults aged 18 years in 2016 are described nationally and across states, as data permit. Expected 20172021 event totals and hospitalization costs were estimated assuming 2016 values remain unchanged. Results: Nationally, in 2016, 2. 2 million hospitalizations (850. 9 per 100, 000 population) resulting in $32. 7 billion in costs, and 415, 480 deaths (157. 4 per 100, 000) occurred. Hospitalization and mortality rates were highest among men (989. 6 and 172. 3 per 100, 000, respectively) and non-Hispanic blacks (211. 6 per 100, 000, mortality only) and increased with age. However, 805, 000 hospitalizations and 75, 245 deaths occurred among adults aged 1864 years. State-level variation occurred in rates of ED visits (from 56. 4 [Connecticut] to 274. 8 per 100, 000 [Kentucky]), hospitalizations (484. 0 [Wyoming] to 1670. 3 per 100, 000 [DC]), and mortality (111. 2 [Vermont] to 267. 3 per 100, 000 [Mississippi]) . Approximately 16. 3 million events and $173. 7 billion in hospitalization costs could occur during 20172021 without preventive intervention. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Million Heartspreventable events place a considerable health and economic burden on the United States. With coordinated efforts, many of these events could be prevented in every state to achieve the initiatives goal. Introduction Heart disease and stroke are largely preventable (13) . However, despite decades-long improvement in outcomes, they remain leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States (2) . Moreover, considerable dispari - ties persist and recent evidence suggests that heart disease and stroke event rates are increasing among certain demographic groups, including adults aged 3564 years (2, 4) . In response, CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched Million Hearts 2022, a national initiative working to prevent one million heart attacks, strokes, and other acute cardiovascular events during 20172021 (1, 5) . Million Hearts 2022, in collaboration with multiple federal, state, and nongovernmental partners, supports the imple - mentation of a selected set of evidence-based public health and clinical strategies aimed at keeping adults healthy and optimizing care to prevent cardiovascular events. This includes using strategies that improve the ABCS (aspirin when appro - priate, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation) of cardiovascular care; reducing sodium consumption, tobacco use, and physical inactivity; improv - ing care among persons who have had cardiovascular events*; and addressing known disparities in cardiovascular outcomes (6) . Despite their efficacy, implementation of these strategies throughout the country has been inconsistent, which might contribute to the disparities and geographic variation observed in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes (2, 4) . * Includes use of cardiac rehabilitation among persons who have had a qualifying cardiac event or procedure and improving awareness of the potential negative health sequelae of and avoiding exposure to poor air quality among persons who have had a previous cardiovascular event.  Includes improving hypertension control among blacks/African Americans and improving prevention and management of CVD risk factors among adults aged 3564 years and persons with mental and/or substance use disorders who use tobacco. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 975 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThis study describes the distribution, by demographic character - istics and state, of nonfatal (emergency department [ED] visits and hospitalizations) and fatal cardiovascular events that occurred dur - ing 2016 and are being targeted for prevention by Million Hearts 2022. Furthermore, it provides a baseline for states by estimating the number of events and hospitalization costs expected to occur if 2016 rates remain unchanged during 20172021. These findings can be used by Million Hearts 2022 partners to understand the recent and potential future event burden if no further intervention occurs, and to focus their use of prevention strategies and assess the potential effect on cardiovascular event totals. Methods This study leverages a previously published methodology to identify mutually exclusive nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events (Million Heartspreventable events) among adults aged 18 years attributed to acute myocardial infarctions, strokes, precursor cardiovascular conditions, and other cardiovascular conditions, by applying specified International Classification of Diseases, T enth Revision (ICD-10) codes within adminis - trative data (Supplementary Table 1, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/ view/cdc/58170) (7) . Where data availability permit, event rates are described at the state and national levels for 2016 (most current available data) . At the state level, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualitys (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Emergency Department Database (SEDD) was used to describe 2016 treat-and-release ED event rates for 34 states and the District of Columbia (DC) ** and the HCUP State Inpatient Database (SID) was used to describe 2016 acute, nonfatal hospitalization event rates for 46 states and DC. Data to generate weighted national estimates for 2016 ED events were unavailable at the time of publication; these data will be used for national Million Hearts surveil - lance as they become available. Weighted national estimates and standard errors were determined for 2016 hospitalization events by using HCUPs National Inpatient Sample (NIS), a database developed from data collected via the State Inpatient Database. The National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System*** Mortality Data were used to describe 2016 mortality rates for the nation and all 50 states and DC. Event rates were stratified by gender and age group (1844, 4564, 6574, and 75 years), race and Hispanic origin (mortality only), event type (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, precursor condition, and other condition), and state. Overall mutually exclusive event rates equal the sum of the treat-and-release ED visits, acute, nonfatal hospitalizations, and deaths and are available for 35 jurisdictions with com - plete data. Rates were standardized by age to the 2010 U. S. Census. Costs associated with hospitalizations were determined by applying HCUP cost-to-charge ratios to the hospital billing charges provided in the SID (state estimates) and NIS (national estimates) and are presented in 2016 US$; these costs exclude professional (physician) fees. The mean cost per hospitalization was calculated and standardized by age and  Million Heartspreventable ED visits and hospitalizations were defined as events where patients had one of the specified ICD-10-CM codes listed as their firstlisted/principal diagnosis (national implementation of ICD-10-CM codes occurred in October 2015); Million Heartsrelated deaths were events with a specified ICD-10 code listed as the underlying cause of death (national implementation of ICD-10 mortality codes occurred in 1999) . Precursor cardiovascular conditions include stable angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack, and other acute and subacute ischemic heart diseases. Other cardiovascular conditions include heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, atheroembolism (hospitalizations only), atherosclerosis and peripheral artery disease (deaths only), hypertension without heart failure, and cardiac arrest that had another Million Heartspreventable event type coded as a secondary diagnosis or contributing cause of death.

S. community, non-rehabilitation, acute care hospitals. In 2016, it included data from all states except Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia; data for Mississippi and Oregon are regularly collected, but 2016 data were not available at the time of this report. T reat-and-release ED event rates represents ED visits that did not result in a hospitalization, and exclude visits where the patient died in the ED, was transferred to another hospital, or was admitted to the same hospital.  The SID (https: //www. hcup-us. ahrq. gov/sidoverview. jsp) is an encounterbased, all-payer (including the uninsured) administrative database capturing claims for 97% of all hospitalizations at U. S. community, nonrehabilitation, acute care hospitals. In 2016, it included data from all states except Alabama, Delaware, Idaho, and New Hampshire. To identify acute, nonfatal hospitalizations, hospitalizations that were reported as elective or where the patient died in the hospital or was transferred to another hospital were excluded.  For national Million Hearts surveillance weighted national ED visit rates are determined using HCUPs Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) (https: //www. hcup-us. ahrq. gov/nedsoverview. jsp), which contains data from 30. 5 million ED visits from about 1, 000 hospitals sampled to approximate a 20% stratified sample of U. S. hospital-based emergency departments. Weighted, there are approximately 143 million ED visits annually.  The NIS (https: //www. hcup-us. ahrq. gov/nisoverview. jsp) approximates a 20% stratified sample of discharges from over 4, 500 U. S. community hospitals. Weighted, there are approximately 36 million discharges annually. *** https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nvss/index. htm.  Race/ethnicity is consistently reported in the SEDD and SID for only 32 states and was therefore not included in the presentation of ED and hospitalization event rates.  ED and hospitalization events were assigned to the state the patient was treated in. Death events were assigned to the residence the individual lived in.  Charge information was available for ED and hospitalization events; however, charge amounts represent only what was billed for services and do not reflect how much the services actually cost the hospital to provide or the amount received in payment. Use of HCUP Cost-to-Charge Ratio Files (CCR) (HCUP. 2016. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. https: //www. hcup-us. ahrq. gov/db/state/costtocharge. jsp) allowed for the conversion from charges to costs, but CCRs are only available for hospitalization charges and not for ED charges. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 976 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionnational event type distribution. **** Age-standardized per capita hospitalization costs, representing the overall cost per adult aged 18 years living in the jurisdiction, are presented at the national and state levels. State-level estimates for the number of Million Hearts preventable events and hospitalization costs (in 2016 US$) expected to occur during 20172021 were calculated in two ways. For states with complete 2016 data (ED, hospitalization, and mortality estimates), the overall age-specific mutually exclusive rates for 2016 were applied to the projected state population estimates during 20172021 and summed to determine the expected event totals; the 2016 mean stateand age-specific cost per hospitalization was applied to the expected hospitalization event total to estimate expected costs. For states with incomplete 2016 data, it was assumed that the proportional relationship across their ED, hospitalization and mortality rates were the same as the average calculated among states with complete data. If a state was missing 2016 hospitalization data, the national age-specific average cost per hospitalization event was applied to their expected age-specific hospitalization event totals and summed. Expected overall U. S. event totals and hospitalization costs during 20172021 equal the sum of the state-level estimates. Results Nationally, in 2016, over 2. 2 million Million Heartsprevent - able hospitalizations and 415, 480 deaths occurred (Table 1) . The hospitalizations resulted in an estimated $32. 7 billion in costs. For both event types, the burden was higher among men than among women (age-standardized hospitalization rates of 989. 6 and 725. 1 per 100, 000 population, respectively, and mortality rates of 172. 3 and 143. 0 per 100, 000, respectively) and increased with age. However, an estimated 805, 000 hospitalizations and 75, 245 deaths occurred among adults aged 1864 years. Among all racial/ ethnic groups, the highest mortality rates were in non-Hispanic blacks (211. 6 per 100, 000) . Acute myocardial infarctions and strokes accounted for approximately half (47%) of hospitalizations (rates of 204. 5 and 199. 1 per 100, 000, respectively) and approxi - mately two thirds (61%) of deaths (42. 2 and 53. 7 per 100, 000, respectively) . Other cardiovascular events, which include those related to heart failure, contributed to 46% of hospitalizations and 38% of deaths (rates = 394. 6 and 59. 8 per 100, 000, respectively) . Age-standardized event rates per 100, 000 population varied considerably across states with available data, including for treat-and-release ED visits (34 states and DC; range = 56. 4 [Connecticut] to 274. 8 [Kentucky]), acute hospitalizations (46 states and DC; range = 484. 0 [Wyoming] to 1670. 3 [DC]), and deaths (50 states and DC; range = 111. 2 [Vermont] to 267. 3 [Mississippi]) (Table 2) (Supplementary Figure 1, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/58168) . Among the 35 juris - dictions with complete overall data, the three with the lowest overall mutually exclusive event rates were Utah (805. 7), Wyoming (828. 9), and Vermont (840. 6) and those with the highest rates were DC (2, 048. 2), Tennessee (1, 551. 6), and Kentucky (1, 510. 3) (Figure) . In 2016, the age-standardized per-capita hospitalization cost was $125 in the United States, and ranged across states with available data from $76, in New Mexico and Wyoming, to $294, in DC (Table 2) . The ageand event type-standardized mean cost per hospitalization was $16, 274 nationally and ranged from $11, 307 in Arkansas to $24, 017 in Alaska. If the 2016 overall mutually exclusive event rates were to remain constant during 20172021, an estimated 16. 3 mil - lion events are expected to occur, including 2. 2 million ED visits, 11. 8 million hospitalizations, and 2. 2 million deaths (Table 3) (Supplementary Table 2, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/ view/cdc/58171); if mean hospitalization costs per event remained constant, an estimated $173. 7 billion in costs would be expected to occur. Preventing one million events during 20172021 would result in approximately a 6. 1% reduction in expected event totals and associated costs. Conclusion and Comment The subset of cardiovascular events targeted for preven - tion by Million Hearts 2022 places a considerable burden on the health and economic well-being of Americans (2, 7) . Despite these events being highly preventable (3), they accounted for approximately 2 million hospitalizations and 400, 000 deaths in 2016. Furthermore, without a more concerted effort to improve CVD risk factors, an estimated 16. 3 million nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events and $173. 7 billion in hospital - ization costs are expected to occur during 20172021. **** Standardized to the 2010 decennial U. S. Census population and to the national distribution of events (percentage of events that were acute myocardial infarctions, strokes, precursor events, or other events) observed during 2016.  State-level population projections were based on the linear extrapolation of 2016 July 1st Census estimates and 2020 population projections provided by the University of Virginias Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service (Available at https: //demographics. coopercenter. org/national-populationprojections and accessed on May 1, 2018) .  The method used here to describe the number of events and total hospitalization cost expected at the national level differs from the method being used to officially track these estimates at the national level; that method uses estimates generated from using the NEDS, NIS, and NVSS (https: //www. ahajournals. org/doi/10. 1161/JAHA. 117. 006021) .  Overall, CVD accounts for approximately 800, 000 deaths and an estimated $300 billion in direct medical expenses and lost productivity annually (2) . The subset of events targeted for prevention by Million Hearts 2022 activities was identified based on multiple factors described by Ritchey et al (https: //www. ahajournals. org/doi/10. 1161/JAHA. 117. 006021) with the most important factor being the preventability of the event by current or planned Million Hearts 2022 efforts.

Described by applying HCUP cost-to-charge ratios to the charges the hospitals billed for the entire hospital stay; these costs exclude professional (physician) fees (https: //www. hcup-us. ahrq. gov/db/state/costtocharge. jsp) . The ageand event type-standardized mean cost per event in the United States was $16, 274 per hospitalization and the age-standardized per-capita cost was $125 per U. S. adult.  Standardized by age to the 2010 U. S. Census population. ** Includes stable angina pectoris, transient ischemic attack, and other acute and subacute ischemic heart disease.  Includes heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, atheroembolism (hospitalizations only), atherosclerosis and peripheral artery disease (deaths only), hypertension without heart failure, and cardiac arrest that had another Million Heartspreventable event type coded as a secondary diagnosis or contributing cause of death.  Persons with unspecified ethnicity were considered to be non-Hispanic (approximately 0. 3% of deaths) . Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 978 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionConsiderable disparities in event rates were evident. Nationally, non-Hispanic blacks continue to experience the highest CVD mortality rates (32% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites) . This disparity is due, in part, to the high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure among blacks (6), placing them at higher risk than other racial/ethnic groups for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and other CVD conditions, including heart failure (2, 8) . Additionally, despite the considerable increase in risk for a cardiovascular event with increasing age, in 2016, over 800, 000 combined hospitalizations and deaths occurred among adults aged <65 years (approximately one in three events) . Other studies have shown that decades-long improvement in heart disease and stroke mortality have stalled (9, 10) and that younger populations, especially those aged 3564 years, are experiencing worse outcomes across the country (4, 9) . In 2016, Million Hearts-preventable event rates among persons aged 3564 years varied considerably by demographic characteris - tics and U. S. state (Supplementary Table 3, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/58172); among the overall 16. 3 million events expected to occur during 20172021 if no additional action is TABLE 2.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 979 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventiontaken, 5. 0 million (30. 9%) are expected to occur among this age group (Supplementary Figure 2, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/ cdc/58169) . Therefore, implementation of strategies that focus on the prevention, early diagnosis, and effective management of CVD risk factors among younger adults is needed to prevent events in both the shortand long-term. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate striking state-level variation in nonfatal cardiovascular event rates and hospitaliza - tion costs using data collected among adults of all ages and across all payer types, including the uninsured. Whereas the burden of state-level mortality was higher in the southeastern United States, which aligns with the findings from previous studies (2), rates for ED visits and hospitalizations were higher in both this region and elsewhere, including many Midwestern states. The overall state variation in nonfatal event rates and associated hospital - ization costs is likely driven by both geographic differences in disease prevalence and severity, and differences in care delivery and public health quality (2, 11) . Additional focus on improving the environments in which persons live, work, and play (e. g. , built environment modifications to promote increased physical activity) (12), leveraging community resources to aid in CVD risk factor management (e. g. , referral to nutritional and fitness counseling groups) (13), providing effective outpatient care (e. g. , use of team-based care for hypertension and cholesterol manage - ment) (14), and improving the care received after a cardiovascular event (e. g. , systematic referral to cardiac rehabilitation services for those with eligible diagnoses) (15) might reduce the need for and the expense of many of these acute care services. This study uses the best available data to describe the burden of Million Heartspreventable events at the national and state levels. However, the findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, not all jurisdictions provided ED and/or hospitalization data; efforts to impute missing values might produce inaccurate estimates. Second, nonfatal events are attrib - uted to treatment location and not patient residence, therefore jurisdictions in close proximity to large population centers in neighboring states (e. g. , DC) could have overestimated or underestimated rates. Third, whereas the methodology used attempts to identify mutually exclusive events, there is poten - tial for over or undercounting events.

Standardized by age to the 2010 U. S. Census population and by event type to the national distribution of events (acute myocardial infarctions, strokes, precursor events, and other cardiovascular events) observed during 2016. ** Represents the overall cost per adult aged 18 years living in the jurisdiction, standardized by age to the 2010 U. S. Census population.  Represents the sum of number of treat-and-release ED visits, acute, nonfatal hospitalizations, and deaths that occurred in that jurisdiction.  Data were not collected or were not available for analysis (treat-and-release ED data for Mississippi and Oregon are regularly collected, but 2016 data were not available at time of this report) .  The ED and hospitalization event and cost values are likely overestimates for this location because these events are attributed to where the event was treated and not the residence of the patient. *** Transfers to other acute care hospitals are not identified in discharge disposition codes, so they could not be excluded from the analysis and the rate may be slightly inflated.

(Continued) Age-standardized Million Hearts preventable emergency department, hospitalization, mortality rates (per 100, 000 population), hospitalization costs, and overall event totals among adults aged 18 years, by state * United States, 2016Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 980 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionevents that do not result in ED or hospital use or death are not counted. Fifth, because administrative data are being used, dif - ferences in use of health care (e. g. , changes in how events are medically managed) or coding practices (e. g. , changes in how nonfatal events are billed) might affect the event rates and costs presented in this study rather than changes in disease burden. However, this study attempts to address differences in practice patterns by excluding elective hospitalizations and including certain ED events (e. g. , heart failure-related visits) . Finally, the hospitalization cost estimates are likely conservative, as they do not include professional (physician) fees, and costs were not available for treat-and-release ED visits. Each state would need to realize an approximate 6% decrease in its expected event totals during 20172021 to collectively prevent one million events at the national level. This is feasible if clinical and public health partners in every state mobilize and strengthen their focus on implementing the prevention strategies outlined by Million Hearts 2022 (https: //million - hearts. hhs. gov/files/MH-Framework. pdf) to achieve 80% or greater performance on the ABCS and at least a 20% reduc - tion in physical inactivity, tobacco use prevalence, and sodium consumption (16) .

The health and economic burden of cardiovascular disease is considerable. Million Hearts 2022 supports use of evidencebased clinical and community strategies to prevent one million cardiovascular events during 20172021. What is added by this report? Nationally, in 2016, 2. 2 million hospitalizations, costing $32. 7 billion, and 415, 480 deaths occurred that are being targeted for preven - tion by Million Hearts 2022, with disparities across demographic characteristics and states. Approximately 16. 3 million events could occur during 20172021 without preventive intervention. What are the implications for public health practice? Achieving the Million Hearts 2022 goal likely requires states to focus on using prevention strategies that best meet the cardiovascular health needs of the persons they serve.

Abbreviation: ED = emergency department. * State-level estimates for the number of Million Heartspreventable events (those targeted for prevention by the initiative) and hospitalization costs expected to occur during 20172021 were calculated in two ways. For states with complete 2016 data (ED, hospitalization, and mortality estimates), the overall age-specific mutually exclusive rates for 2016 were applied to the projected state population estimates during 20172021 and summed to determine the expected event totals; the 2016 mean stateand age-specific cost per hospitalization was applied to the expected hospitalization event total to estimate expected costs. For states with incomplete 2016 data, it was assumed that the proportional relationship across their ED, hospitalization, and mortality rates was the same as the average calculated among states with complete data. If a state was missing 2016 hospitalization data, the national age-specific average cost per hospitalization event was applied to their expected age-specific hospitalization event totals and summed. Expected overall U. S. event totals and costs during 20172021 equals the sum of the state-level estimates; this method differs from the method being used to officially track these estimates at the national level.  ED rate was missing, therefore, an estimate was used.  Hospitalization rate and cost per hospitalization information were missing, therefore, estimates were used.  Calculated by using estimated ED visit rates and, where applicable, estimated hospitalization rates and summing those resultant event counts with the known death counts. TABLE 3.

Wall, MPH1; Matthew D. Ritchey, DPT1; Cathleen Gillespie, MS1; John D. Omura, MD2; Ahmed Jamal, MBBS3; Mary G. George, MD1 Abstract Introduction: Despite decades-long reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, CVD mortality rates have recently plateaued and even increased in some subgroups, and the prevalence of CVD risk factors remains high. Million Hearts 2022, a 5-year initiative, was launched in 2017 to address this burden. This report establishes a baseline for the CVD risk factors targeted for reduction by the initiative during 20172021 and highlights recent changes over time. Methods: Risk factor prevalence among U. S. adults was assessed using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and National Health Interview Survey. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess differences in prevalence during 20112012 and the most recent cycle of available data, and across subgroups. Results: During 20132014, the prevalences of aspirin use for primary and secondary CVD prevention were 27. 4% and 74. 9%, respectively, and of statin use for cholesterol management was 54. 5%. During 20152016, the average daily sodium intake was 3, 535 mg/day and the prevalences of blood pressure control, combustible tobacco use, and physical inactivity were 48. 5%, 22. 3%, and 29. 1%, respectively. Compared with 20112012, significant decreases occurred in the prevalences of combustible tobacco use and physical inactivity; however, a decrease also occurred for aspirin use for primary or secondary prevention. Disparities in risk factor prevalences were observed across age groups, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Millions of Americans have CVD risk factors that place them at increased risk for having a cardiovascular event, despite the existence of proven strategies for preventing or managing CVD risk factors. A concerted effort to implement these strategies will be needed to prevent one million acute cardiovascular events during the 5-year initiative. Introduction Despite steady declines in CVD mortality rates over approxi - mately the last 40 years, heart disease and stroke remain the first and fifth leading causes of death in the United States, respectively, and their associated mortality rates have recently begun to plateau in the general population and even increase among some subpopulations. (13) Furthermore, CVD annually accounts for approximately $330 billion in direct and indirect costs in the United States: approximately one in seven health care dollars is spent on CVD (4) . To address this burden, in 2012, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services launched Million Hearts, a national initiative co-led by CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with the goal of preventing one million acute cardiovascular events over 5 years. Because important groundwork and progress were made during the first 5 years (5, 6), Million Hearts 2022 was launched in 2017 to accelerate the implementation of effective strategies to improve cardiovascular health. During 20172021, Million Hearts 2022 priorities are keep - ing adults healthy through community-based strategies that reduce combustible tobacco use, sodium intake, and physical inactivity as well as optimizing health care for those with and at risk for CVD through clinical strategies that improve appropri - ate aspirin use, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, tobacco cessation, and participation in cardiac rehabilitation. * Million Hearts 2022 also has a special focus on selected priority populations at risk, including blacks/African Americans with hypertension, adults aged 3564 years for whom heart disease mortality rates are rising, adults who have had a previous heart attack or stroke, and persons with mental health or substance use disorders who use tobacco (7) . This report uses several national surveillance systems to provide baseline data and describe recent changes for key CVD risk factors for which accelerated progress must be made to achieve national goals. * Although participation in cardiac rehabilitation is an evidence-based strategy for preventing secondary CVD-related events, it is not considered a key CVD risk factor. Therefore the participation data are not included in this report. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 984 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionMethods Data for this report were gathered from three national surveillance systems: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) . The details for all three surveys have been published previously (810) . NHANES is a complex survey of a multistage probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U. S. population that combines interviews and physical examinations. Data from NHANES from 2011 to 2014 were used to calculate preva - lence estimates for aspirin use for primary CVD prevention** among adults aged 5059 years, aspirin use for secondary CVD prevention among adults aged 40 years, combined aspirin use as appropriate among adults aged 40 years, and statin use among eligible adults aged 21 years. Mean daily sodium intake (mg/day) *** among adults aged 18 years and blood pressure control estimates among adults aged 18 years with hypertension were calculated using 20112016 NHANES data. NSDUH is an annual nationwide survey that collects information through face-to-face household interviews about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among the non - institutionalized U. S. population aged 12 years. Data from the 20112016 NSDUH were combined into 2-year cycles to estimate the prevalence of current combustible tobacco use among adults aged 18 years. NHIS is an annual, nationally representative, in-person sur - vey of the noninstitutionalized U. S. civilian population. Data from the 20112016 NHIS were combined into 2-year cycles  During 20112016, unweighted examination response rates ranged from 58. 7% to 69. 5%. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nhanes. htm.  During 20112016, weighted interview response rates ranged from 71. 2% to 74. 4%. https: //datafiles. samhsa. gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-andhealth-nsduh-2011-nid13563; https: //datafiles. samhsa. gov/study/nationalsurvey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2012-nid13601; https: //datafiles. samhsa. gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2013-nid13555; https: //datafiles. samhsa. gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-healthnsduh-2014-nid13618; https: //datafiles. samhsa. gov/study/national-surveydrug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893; https: //datafiles. samhsa. gov/ study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2016-nid17184.  During 20112016, the final response rate for the sample adult component ranged from 79. 7%81. 7%. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nhis. htm. ** The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 5059 years who have no history of CVD, a 10% 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk, and are not at increased risk for bleeding (https: //www. uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/aspirin-to-preventcardiovascular-disease-and-cancer) . Aspirin use in NHANES was defined by self-report or aspirin identified in the prescription medication data files. Participants who were taking an anticoagulant but not taking aspirin/ antiplatelets were excluded as being at increased risk for bleeding. Participants who reported that they stopped taking aspirin because of side effects were excluded. During 20112014, among 2, 776 adults aged 5059 years examined in NHANES with complete data to determine aspirin eligibility, 338 met the criteria for aspirin use for primary prevention.  Aspirin use for secondary event prevention is recommended for adults aged 40 years with a history of CVD, defined as self-reported angina, coronary heart disease, heart attack, or stroke. Aspirin use in NHANES was defined by self-report or aspirin identified in the prescription medication data files. During 20112014, among 11, 184 adults aged 40 years examined in NHANES with complete data to determine aspirin eligibility, 913 met the criteria for aspirin use for secondary prevention.  Aspirin when appropriate is defined as primary or secondary prevention use among eligible adults. During 20112014, 1, 251 adults 40 years were included in the aspirin when appropriate analyses.  The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends statin treatment for persons 1) with clinical atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD); 2) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 190 mg/dL; 3) aged 4075 years with diabetes, LDL-C 70189 mg/dL, and without clinical ASCVD; or 4) aged 4075 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes with LDL-C 70189 mg/dL, and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 7. 5% (https: //www. ahajournals. org/ doi/abs/10. 1161/01. cir. 0000437738. 63853. 7a; https: //www. ahajournals. org/doi/abs/10. 1161/01. cir. 0000437741. 48606. 98) . Statin use was identified using the NHANES prescription medication data files. During 20112014, among 4, 358 non-pregnant adults aged 21 years in the morning fasting subsample in NHANES with complete data to determine statin eligibility, 1, 823 met the criteria for statin use. *** Dietary sodium intake is estimated from the NHANES Day 1 dietary recall interviews (https: //www. ars. usda. gov/ba/bhnrc/fsrg) . During 20112016, 15, 698 adults aged 18 years had a complete and reliable Day 1 dietary recall and were included in the sodium analyses.  Defined among adults with hypertension as systolic BP of <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP of <90 mm Hg, based on the average of up to three measurements. ACC/AHA released a new hypertension management guideline in November 2017 that uses 130/80 mm Hg to define blood pressure control (https: //professional. heart. org/professional/ScienceNews/ UCM_496965_2017-Hypertension-Clinical-Guidelines. jsp) . Here, 140/90 mm Hg is used to define control because that was the standard, as recommended for the general population by the Seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and T reatment of High Blood Pressure, when these data were collected (Chobanian A V, Bakris G, Black H, et al. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and T reatment of High Blood Pressure: the JNC 7 report. JAMA 2003; 289: 2560-2572) . Among the participants, approximately 95% had two or three blood pressure measurements during a single physical examination at the mobile examination center. For the remainder with only one blood pressure measurement, that single measurement was used in place of an average. During 20112016, of the 16, 457 nonpregnant adults aged 18 years examined in NHANES with complete blood pressure and medication data, 5, 765 were defined as hypertensive and included in the blood pressure analyses.  Combustible tobacco use includes the use of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. The percentage of adults aged 18 years who reported smoking cigarettes on at least 1 day during the preceding 30 days and 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, or who reported smoking cigars or a pipe on at least 1 day during the preceding 30 days. During 20112016, of the 242, 283 persons aged 18 years included in the NSDUH population, 241, 799 were included in the current combustible tobacco use analyses. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 985 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionto estimate the prevalence of physical inactivity among adults aged 18 years. Up to three survey cycles (20112012, 20132014, and 20152016) were examined using sex-, age-, and race/ ethnicity-adjusted regression analyses. Sex-, age-, and race/ ethnicity-adjusted t-tests were used to examine prevalence changes comparing 20112012 with the most recent data cycle and differences between sex, age, and racial/ethnic groups within the most recent data cycle. Results were considered significant for p-values <0. 05. Results Clinical Strategies. During 20132014, the prevalences of recommended aspirin use for primary and secondary CVD pre - vention were 27. 4% and 74. 9%, respectively, with a significant decrease from 20112012 for primary prevention (43. 4%) but not for secondary prevention (Table 1) (Figure 1) . Combined, the prevalence of aspirin use when appropriate was 60. 8%, which represents a significant decline from 69. 2%, during 20112012 (Figure 1) and equates to an estimated 9. 0 million persons not taking aspirin as recommended. The prevalence of aspirin use for secondary prevention was higher among adults aged 65 years (81. 4%) than among those aged 4064 years (63. 2%), and among non-Hispanic whites (whites) (77. 9%) compared with Hispanics (51. 5%) . The overall prevalence of recommended aspirin use when appropriate was higher among adults aged 65 years than among those aged 4064 years. During 20152016, the prevalence of blood pressure (BP) control was 48. 5%, with no significant changes occurring during 20112012 (Figure 1) . This equates to an estimated 40. 2 mil - lion persons with uncontrolled hypertension (Supplementary Figure, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/58116) . The prevalence of BP control was higher among adults aged 4564 years (53. 8%) than among those aged 1844 years (40. 0%) and 65 years (45. 9%), and among whites (50. 9%) than among non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) (44. 3%) . The prevalence of cholesterol management through statin use among eligible adults during 20132014 was 54. 5%, with no significant change occurring during 20112012 (Figure 1) . Prevalence was higher among persons aged 65 years (63. 5%) than among those aged 4564 years (50. 3%), and among whites (58. 3%) than among Hispanics (33. 7%) . An estimated 39. 1 million adults are not managing their CVD risk through recommended statin use. Though the prevalence of BP control was higher among adults aged 3564 years (a Million Hearts priority popula - tion) (52. 9%) than among those aged 65 years (45. 9%), still approximately half do not have their condition under control. The prevalence of statin use when indicated among persons aged 3564 years (48. 1%) was lower than that among those aged 65 years (63. 5%) (Supplementary Table, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/58119) . Community Risk Factors. Despite a significant decline in use of combustible tobacco products, from 25. 1% of adults in 20112012, to 22. 3% during 20152016, an estimated 54. 1 million adult users of combustible tobacco products could benefit from cessation interventions (Figure 2) . During 2015 2016, the prevalence of combustible tobacco use was higher among men (26. 7%) than among women (18. 1%), decreased with increasing age after age 2544 years, and varied by race/ ethnicity. Prevalence was higher among whites (24. 0%) than among Hispanics (16. 0%) and non-Hispanic Asians (10. 3%); however, persons of other race/ethnicity, which includes American Indians and Alaska Natives, reported the highest prevalence (30. 8%) of combustible tobacco use (Table 2) . During 20152016, the mean daily sodium intake among adults was 3, 535 mg/day, with no significant change occurring from 20112012 (Figure 2) . Sodium intake was higher among men (4, 095 mg/day) than among women (3, 013 mg/day) and decreased with increasing age, from 3, 809 mg/day for persons aged 1844 years to 3, 524 mg/day for those aged 4564 years, and 2, 947 mg/day among adults aged 65 years. During 20152016, the prevalence of physical inactivity was 29. 1%, a small but statistically significant decrease from 30. 9% during 20112012 (Figure 2) . This represents an esti - mated 70. 7 million adults who currently partake in no leisure time physical activity. The prevalence of physical inactivity was higher among women (30. 7%) than among men (27. 3%), increased with increasing age, and was higher among blacks (36. 9%) and Hispanics (36. 1%) than among whites (26. 4%) . Among the Million Hearts priority population of adults aged 3564 years, the prevalence of combustible tobacco product use and average daily sodium intake were higher than those among adults aged 65 years, while the prevalence of physical inactivity was lower (Supplementary Table, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/58119) . Conclusion and Comment To reach the Million Hearts 2022 goal of preventing one million acute cardiovascular events over 5 years, substantial progress is needed in reducing CVD-related risk factors. To achieve needed progress, Million Hearts 2022 has set clinical  The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (https: //www. health. gov/ PAGuidelines/) recommend that all adults should avoid inactivity and that some physical activity is better that none. NHIS questions ask about frequency of participation in light to moderate-intensity and vigorousintensity leisure-time physical activities for at least 10 minutes. Questions are phrased in terms of current behavior and lack a specific reference period. Physical inactivity is defined as reporting no light to moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity for at least 10 minutes. During 20112016, of the 205, 493 adults aged 18 years included in the NHIS population, 202, 941 were included in the physical inactivity analyses.

At the community level, a 20% reduction in the prevalence of combustible tobacco product use and of physical inactivity and a 20% reduction in mean daily sodium intake are targeted. These indicators, along with cardiac rehabilitation participation, are the focus of Million Hearts 2022; progress in reaching indicator targets has been shown to have a substantial effect on preventing acute cardiovascular events (11, 12) . The data in this report serve as a baseline for Million Hearts 2022. These findings suggest that in addition to universal strate - gies aimed at the entire population with and at risk for CVD, there is a need to focus action on high-burden, high-risk subsets of the population. For example, opportunities for risk factor prevention and management among younger adults are of par - ticular importance given the increase in heart disease mortality observed from 2010 to 2015 among adults aged 3564 years in approximately half of U. S. counties (3) . Compared with adults aged 65 years, younger adults were less likely to be using aspirin or taking a statin when indicated and were more likely to use combustible tobacco and have an elevated daily sodium intake. Furthermore, only approximately half of adults aged 3564 years Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 989 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwith hypertension have their BP under control. If the popula - tion deficits for each risk factor in this analysis (e. g. , 9. 0 million persons who are not taking aspirin as recommend) are summed, they represent approximately 213 million opportunities for better risk factor prevention and management, many of which might be present in the same person. More than half of these opportunities are among adults aged 3564 years. Additional demographic disparities in risk factor prevalence present opportunities to develop and implement culturally and linguistically tailored and effective interventions. For example, compared with whites, Hispanics were less likely to use aspirin for secondary prevention or take a statin when indicated, blacks were less likely to have their blood pressure under control, and persons of other racial/ethnic groups, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, were more likely to use combus - tible tobacco products. Other studies confirm the existence of these disparities (1315) . Included in the Million Hearts 2022-recommended clinical strategies are self-measured blood pressure monitoring with clinical support, **** standardized treatment protocols, reduced out-of-pocket costs and adherence approaches for medications, clinician-driven tobacco assessment and treat - ment, ***** increasing awareness of the effect of particle pollu - tion (including tobacco smoke, automobile or diesel exhaust, and wood smoke) on persons with known heart disease, and using clinical data to identify persons with undiagnosed conditions. Community-based strategies include com - prehensive smoke-free policies, evidence-based tobacco cessation campaigns, ****** sodium reduction strategies, built environment approaches to increase physical activ - ity, increased access to places for physical activity, and peer support programs. ******* Public and private partners, such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualitys EvidenceNOW initiative, state and local departments of health, the National Association of Community Health Centers, and Target: BP from the American Heart Association and the American Medical Association, are actively implementing these strategies. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, some data used in this analysis are self-reported and subject to recall and social desirability biases. Second, when the data assessing aspirin use for primary CVD prevention were collected, multiple clinical guidelines existed; definitions from the current U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation, published in 2016, were retrospectively applied for this analysis. Third, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Associations (ACC/ AHA) cholesterol management guideline, released in November 2013 with a focus on high-intensity statin use (treatment that low - ers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by approximately 50%) among eligible persons at high risk for cardiovascular events, was retrospectively applied to the 20112012 data. NHANES data allow for reporting only on general statin use and not statin intensity, which might result in overestimating the prevalence of the statineligible population meeting recommendations. Fourth, Million Hearts focuses on the ABCS, which include smoking cessation through assessment and treatment in a clinical setting. However, population-level data for this indicator do not exist so only com - bustible tobacco use prevalence can be monitored, but not clinical actions that support cessation. Finally, as with many national data collection efforts, there is a 23 year data lag for some indicators. As a result, incongruous data cycles are reported in this analysis. Summary What is already known about this topic? The decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rate has begun to plateau in the general population and has increased among some subpopulations; the prevalence of CVD risk factors remains high. Million Hearts 2022 was launched to focus the nation on high-impact, evidence-based strategies to prevent one million acute cardiovascular events over five years. What is added by this report? During 20152016, adult sodium intake averaged 3, 535 mg/day and the prevalences of blood pressure control, combustible tobacco use, and physical inactivity were 48. 5%, 22. 3% and 29. 1%, respectively. Compared with 20112012, significant improvements were observed in combustible tobacco use and physical inactivity, but the prevalence of aspirin use to prevent CVD declined. What are the implications for public health practice? A concerted effort to implement evidence-based strategies is needed to achieve the Million Hearts 2022 goal. **** https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/tools-protocols/smbp. html.  https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/tools-protocols/protocols. html.  https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/cardiovascular-diseasereducing-out-pocket-costs-cardiovascular-disease-preventive-services; https: // www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/tobacco-use-and-secondhandsmoke-exposure-reducing-out-pocket-costs-evidence-based-cessation.  https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/tools-protocols/medication-adherence. html. ***** https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/files/Tobacco-Cessation-Action-Guide. pdf.  https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/tools-protocols/tools/particle-pollution. html.  https: //millionhearts. hhs. gov/tools-protocols/hiding-plain-sight/index. html.  https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/ tobacco-use-and-secondhand-smoke-exposure-smoke-free-policies. ****** https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/tobacco-use-andsecondhand-smoke-exposure-mass-reach-health-communicationinterventions; https: //www. cdc. gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/index. html  https: //www. cdc. gov/vitalsigns/sodium.  https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/ physical-activity-built-environment-approaches.  https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/ physical-activity-creating-or-improving-places-physical-activity. ******* https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/findings/ physical-activity-social-support-interventions-community-settings.  https: //www. ahrq. gov/evidencenow/index. html.  https: //targetbp. org/.

Sutter, MD1, 2; Michel Zaffran, MEng1 Substantial progress has been made since the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis in 1988 (1) . Among the three wild poliovirus (WPV) types, type 2 (WPV2) was declared eradicated in 2015, and type 3 (WPV3) has not been reported since 2012 (1) . In 2017 and 2018, only Afghanistan and Pakistan have reported WPV type 1 (WPV1) transmission (1) . When global eradication of poliomyelitis is achieved, facilities retaining poliovirus materials need to minimize the risk for reintroduction of poliovirus into com - munities and reestablishment of transmission. Poliovirus containment includes biorisk management requirements for laboratories, vaccine production sites, and other facilities that retain polioviruses after eradication; the initial milestones are for containment of type 2 polioviruses (PV2s) . At the 71st WHA in 2018, World Health Organization (WHO) Member States adopted a resolution urging acceleration of poliovirus containment activities globally, including establishment by the end of 2018 of national authorities for containment (NACs) to oversee poliovirus containment (2) . This report summarizes containment progress since the previous report (3) and outlines remaining challenges. As of August 2018, 29 countries had designated 81 facilities to retain PV2 materials; 22 of these countries had established NACs. Although there has been substantial progress, intensification of containment measures is needed. Background The Global Polio Eradication Initiative continues to make progress toward polio eradication. Only 22 cases from a single serotype (WPV1) were reported in 2017 from Afghanistan and Pakistan, two of the three countries with endemic poliovirus transmission (1) . Nigeria did not detect WPV cases in 2017 (1) . The last reported indigenous WPV2 case was detected in 1999 (1) . After the global certification of WPV2 eradication in 2015, the type 2 vaccine component was synchronously withdrawn from use worldwide in May 2016 by switching from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV, containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3) . Although the global switch was implemented without major issues in most countries, the detec - tion of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) (poliovirus strains that have mutated from the vaccine virus and reverted to neurovirulence because of unusually prolonged circulation in populations with low immunity levels) has necessitated the distribution of 126 million doses of monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2) for outbreak control in 11 countries (Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and Syria) (1, 4, 5) (Figure) . In 2018, outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia), and northern Nigeria have required further use of the mOPV2 global stockpile. * Since the global withdrawal of type 2-containing OPVs in 2016, PV2 (WPV2, VDPV2, and OPV2) must be retained under stringent containment conditions (6) . Containment is intended to minimize the risk for release of polioviruses from facilities, which would permit occurrence of paralytic disease and reestablishment of transmission. Guidance and Oversight The WHO Global Action Plan to minimize poliovirus facilityassociated risk after type-specific eradication of wild polioviruses and sequential cessation of oral poliovirus vaccine use (GAPIII) (7) defines the biorisk management standards to be followed by facilities retaining poliovirus materials. Implementation of these standards begins with the estab - lishment of national inventories for facilities retaining PV2 materials. The Containment Certification Scheme to support the WHO Global Action Plan for Poliovirus Containment (GAPIII-CCS) (8) defines the recommended mechanisms for verifying compliance with global poliovirus containment requirements within poliovirus essential facilities (PEFs) . The implementation of poliovirus containment is complicated by the potential for facilities to retain materials that might inci - dentally contain polioviruses (e. g. , biological specimens such as fecal, respiratory, or sewage samples collected at a time and place where WPVs were circulating or where OPV2 was in use) . To help facilities identify, eliminate, and minimize risks for handling and storing such samples, WHO in 2018 issued guidance to minimize risks for facilities that collect, handle, or store materials potentially containing infectious polioviruses (9) . Facilities with a high probability of handling or storing such samples include those working with enteric disease agents * http: //polioeradication. org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 993 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (e. g. , rotavirus, Salmonella, or hepatitis viruses), respiratory disease agents (e. g. , influenza virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or measles virus), or that are involved with nutrition research or environmental studies. All 194 WHO Member States are requested to implement the guidance and complete reports on PV2 material by April 2019. Infrastructure and mechanisms for poliovirus containment governance were established to support national and global containment implementation and certification processes. At the 71st WHA in May 2018, WHO Member States unani - mously adopted Resolution WHA71. 16 (2), which urged international commitment to expedite full implementation of GAPIII requirements worldwide. After adoption of the resolution, countries are expected to complete PV2 invento - ries, destroy unneeded PV2 materials, and begin inventories for WPV1 and WPV3 materials in accordance with WHO guidance. In addition, countries must reduce to a minimum  http: //polioeradication. org/who-we-are/governance-and-structure. the number of facilities designated to retain polioviruses, appoint a NAC by the end of 2018, and formally engage these designated PEFs in the containment certification process no later than the end of 2019. The Global Commission for the Certification of Eradication of Poliomyelitis (GCC) is the oversight body for containment until the certification of global eradication of polio - myelitis. The GCC Containment Working Group reviews PEF containment certification applications submitted by NACs to ensure that GAPIII requirements are met, according to the GAPIII-CCS process. The Containment Advisory Group serves as the advisory body to the Director-General of WHO and issues regular reports on technical issues related to the implementation of GAPIII. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization provides recommendations on polio immuniza - tion policies and coverage targets in accordance with the population immunity requirements (secondary safeguards) of GAPIII (10) . The Containment Management Group manages and coordinates GPEI partner support of global containment activities, including the recent development of a framework for con - tainment risk assessment and risk ranking for PEFs. In October 2018, the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization is expected to endorse the revised WHO Technical Report Series 926, which provides guidelines for the safe production and quality control of poliomyelitis vaccines in the containment era. The revised Technical Report Series 926 and GAPIII will be closely aligned. Progress To prevent reintroduction of poliovirus and reestablishment of transmission, the number of facilities designated to retain PV2 materials will need to be reduced to the minimum neces - sary to perform critical national and international functions (e. g. , vaccine production, diagnosis, and research) . However, early counts of designated PEFs included well over 100 facili - ties worldwide. To address this issue, country visits have been made, and governments will continue to be urged to carefully consider the implications of designating facilities to retain  http: //polioeradication. org/tools-and-library/policy-reports/advisory-reports/ containment-advisory-group.  http: //www. who. int/biologicals/BS. 2018. 2350_Poliomyelitis_vaccine_ Guidelines. pdf.

As of August 2018, a total of 81 PEFs had been designated by governments in 29 countries to retain PV2 materials, including 22 that had reported the establish - ment of their NACs (Table), compared with reports from 2017, when 86 facilities within 30 countries were planning to move forward with PEF designation and only 18 NACs had been established (3) . NACs are the authorities for auditing facilities and issu - ing containment certificates. This three-certificate process is overseen by the GCC through the Containment Working Group and includes a certificate of participation (i. e. , official recognition as a PEF), interim certificate of containment (i. e. , indication of not achieving all GAPIII requirements during the PV2 period while addressing the need for full compliance with GAPIII), and certificate of containment (i. e. , full compliance with GAPIII requirements) . To date, the GCC has endorsed one certificate of participation submitted according to the GAPIII-CCS process by the NAC of Sweden. ** All remaining applications for certificate of participation must be submitted for the approval by the GCC Containment Working Group by the end of 2019. To strengthen the auditing capacity of NACs and to create a pool of international GAPIII auditors, WHO continues to provide biorisk management and GAPIII auditor train - ings throughout the six WHO regions. In addition, WHO and global partners are providing regional and national level training in the implementation of the guidance for retaining potentially infectious poliovirus materials. ** http: //polioeradication. org/news-post/sweden-takes-important-firststep-to-demonstrate-containment-of-type-2-poliovirus. Discussion Substantial progress toward poliovirus containment has been made during 20172018, including reduction in the number of designated PEFs, establishment of the majority of NACs, and the initiation of the containment certification process. In addition, WHO and global partners have implemented containment trainings in all six WHO regions, global polio advisory groups have made recommendations to facilitate GAPIII implementation, and the 2018 WHA resolution has prioritized global poliovirus containment. Poliovirus containment is a national responsibility, and it is expected that the number of designated PEFs will be further reduced as countries carefully determine whether the programs, funding, and other resources needed to achieve and maintain full compliance with GAPIII requirements are a national or international priority. The implementation of containment activities, such as completion of national PV2 inventories, establishment of NACs, and certification of PEFs, has required more time than had been anticipated. This extended timeline resulted from many factors, including delayed submission of PV2 inventories, training and retention of qualified GAPIIICCS auditors, and extensive PEF preparations required to meet GAPIII standards. In addition, many countries do not have established legislation to provide NACs with legal authority to enforce GAPIII, or existing national biosafety regulations are not consistent with GAPIII requirements. The identification of potentially infectious poliovirus materials in nonpolio facili - ties is an enormous global undertaking that places a burden on facilities that were never intended to handle polioviruses. Continued global engagement, education, and technical body oversight; a robust communication strategy; and enhanced political will are required to resolve these issues. TABLE.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 995 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionPoliovirus containment is a global effort that is integral to polio eradication. In the coming year, all countries are expected to complete their inventories and destroy or transfer unneeded PV2 materials and initiate the inventory and destruction or transfer of unneeded WPV1 and WPV3 materials. Countries also need to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of designating facilities for the retention of poliovirus materials and the need to comply with the primary (facility), secondary (population immunity), and tertiary (sanitation and hygiene) safeguards. Importantly, countries hosting PEFs must establish NACs and begin the certification process following the GAPIII-CCS process. Further intensification of measures will be needed to ensure that effective containment will be in place by the time the world is certified polio-free.

All type 2 polioviruses must now be destroyed or safely and securely contained to minimize the risk for reintroduction into communities and reestablishment of transmission. What is added by this report? Twenty-nine countries have designated 81 facilities for the retention of needed poliovirus type 2 materials to perform critical national or international functions under certified conditions, including vaccine production, diagnosis, and research. What are the implications for public health practice? If not securely contained, release of the virus could result in reestablishment of endemic or epidemic poliovirus transmis - sion. Further measures will be needed to ensure effective containment by the time the world is certified polio-free. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 996 MMWR / September 7, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 35 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNotes from the Field Acquisition of Delamanid Under a Compassionate Use Program for Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis  United States, 2017 Alfred A. Lardizabal, MD1; Anum N. Khan, MPH2, 3; Sapna Bamrah Morris, MD3; Neela D. Goswami, MD3 On April 10, 2017, a middle-aged man from Eastern Europe was evaluated at a hospital with cough, chest pain, weakness, and weight loss. A sputum sample was smear-positive for acidfast bacilli (AFB), and chest radiograph and chest computer - ized tomography scan showed bilateral pulmonary, cavitary disease with vertebral involvement. He was given standard first-line therapy (HRZE) : isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Among three of the patients family members evaluated as part of the contact investigation, his wife tested positive for tuberculosis (TB) infection via QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-T ube test and was treated for latent TB infection with 4 months of rifampin. * T wo weeks after initiating treatment, the patient developed a rash, and further TB medical consultation was sought. HRZE was discontinued, and he was started on levofloxacin and linezolid before being discharged from the hospital. Sputum was sent to CDC for Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance testing (https: //www. cdc. gov/tb/topic/laboratory/default. htm), which identified mutations consistent with resistance to HRZE, fluoroquinolones, and the injectable aminoglycosides amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin. Drug susceptibility testing by 7H11 agar proportion at the National Jewish Health Mycobacteriology Laboratory (Denver, Colorado) confirmed resistance to HRZE, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, ethionamide, and ciprofloxacin/ofloxacin, and reported susceptibility to cycloserine, para-aminosalicyclic acid (PAS), linezolid, clofazimine, and bedaquiline. Given the limited treatment options, the patient began a regimen of beda - quiline, clofazimine, linezolid, PAS, and cycloserine. In light of the extensively drug-resistant (XDR) disease and potential for limited drug tolerability, inclusion of delamanid, which is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was recommended by a CDC-funded TB Center of Excellence (TB COE) and the CDCs Division of TB Elimination. Delamanid, a nitro-imidazole, is a new anti-TB drug devel - oped to address some of the adverse reactions and related * https: //www. cdc. gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi. htm. adherence difficulties associated with currently available medications for treating drug-resistant TB. Multiple delamanid trials have evaluated safety, tolerability, and early bactericidal activity (1, 2) . Delamanid use, in combination with World Health Organization (WHO) recommended drugs for drugresistant TB, has shown improvement in treatment outcomes (35) and effectiveness against XDR TB, for which treatment options are limited (6) . A U. S. physician, in conjunction with a TB COE and CDCs Division of T uberculosis Elimination, collaborated to acquire delamanid for this patient with XDR TB through a compassionate use program. Per pharmaceutical manufacturer instructions, the proposed regimen and monitoring protocols were reviewed and approved by the European Respiratory Society/WHO Consilium, after which the treating physician was instructed to file an emer - gency investigational new drug application for single-patient expanded-access with FDA. Within 1 day of submission of the forms, FDA approved the emergency investigational new drug application for delamanid. The treating physician completed a company-sponsored 90-minute pharmacovigilance training webinar via teleconference. After requirements were fulfilled, medications were shipped. A 6-month supply of delamanid arrived within 5 days of application approval, and the patient was started on delamanid in late August. The patients initial symptoms, which included fatigue, anorexia, and cough, improved within the first month of treatment. His sputum smear converted to negative on August 22 and culture con - verted to negative October 31. The patient is continuing on a 24-month treatment plan at this time with continued clinical improvement and no reported adverse effects. The process from application filing to delamanid initia - tion took 4 weeks. The pharmaceutical company provided clear instructions, contact information for concerns faced by the physician during treatment, and assistance completing FDA single-patient expanded-access forms. Physicians and state or local TB providers considering use of delamanid for their TB patients can seek guidance from CDCs Division of T uberculosis Elimination or their regional CDC-funded TB COE. Prompt access to this new anti-TB drug increased therapeutic options for this patient with XDR disease.  CDCs Division of T uberculosis Elimination can be reached at 404-639-8120.

Birth order refers to the number of children born alive to the mother. Births recorded with no birth order stated are proportionately distributed across birth order categories.  The number of repeat births to females aged 1519 years per 1, 000 females aged 1519 years.  Urbanization level is based on maternal county of residence. Counties were classified according to their metropolitan status using the National Center for Health Statistics UrbanRural Classification Scheme. https: // www. cdc. gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural. htm. From 2007 to 2016, the rate for repeat births for females aged 1519 years significantly declined in both rural and urban counties. Repeat birth rates declined 49% in rural counties (from 9. 7 in 2007 to 4. 9 in 2016) and 60% in urban counties (from 7. 7 in 2007 to 3. 1 in 2016) . However, the rate in rural counties was significantly higher than the rate in urban counties for each year from 2007 through 2016.
