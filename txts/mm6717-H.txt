U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNational Arthritis Awareness Month  May 2018 May is National Arthritis Awareness Month. In the United States, 54 million adults have some form of doctor-diagnosed arthritis (1), a number projected to increase to 78 million by 2040. * Approximately two thirds of adults with arthritis have overweight or obesity (1), and only 36% meet the recom - mended aerobic physical activity guidelines. Engaging in physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage arthritis symptoms. Physical activity can reduce arthritis pain, improve function and mood, and delay the onset of disability. Even small amounts of weight loss have been shown to significantly reduce pressure on the joints. Adults who have overweight or obesity and receive weight-loss counseling from a health care provider are approximately four times more likely to attempt to lose weight than are those who do not receive counseling (2) . Health care providers can play a valuable role by counseling their patients with arthritis to be physically active, lose weight if they have overweight or obesity, and get self-management education (2, 3) . A report in this issue found that the percentage of health care providers counseling arthritis patients about weight loss increased significantly from 2002 to 2014 (3) . * https: //onlinelibrary. wiley. com/doi/epdf/10. 1002/art. 39692.  https: //www. sciencedirect. com/science/article/pii/S0749379717302076.  https: //www. cdc. gov/arthritis/basics/management. htm.

Roper, MD, MPH William Schaffner, MDtarget for health care provider (hereafter provider) counseling for weight loss among persons with arthritis and overweight or obesity is 45. 3%. Adults with overweight or obesity who receive weight-loss counseling from a provider are approxi - mately four times more likely to attempt to lose weight than are those who do not receive counseling (6) . To estimate changes in the prevalence of provider counseling for weight loss reported by adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity, CDC ana - lyzed National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. Overall, age-standardized estimates of provider counseling for weight loss increased by 10. 4 percentage points from 2002 (35. 1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 33. 037. 3) to 2014 (45. 5%; 95% CI = 42. 948. 1) (p<0. 001) . Providing comprehensive behavioral counseling (including nutrition, physical activity, and self-management education) and encouraging evidencebased weight-loss program participation can result in enhanced health benefits for this population. NHIS is an ongoing, in-person, cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. CDC analyzed data on adults aged 18 years with arthritis and overweight or obesity from the Sample Adult component for 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2014 (24, 27536, 697; response rate = 58. 9%74. 3%) . Having arthritis was defined as an affirmative response to the question Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health care professional that you have arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia? Body mass index (BMI), defined as weight (kg) divided by height (m2), was calculated from self-reported height and weight and categorized as: normal/underweight (<25); over - weight (25 to <30); and obese (30) . Obesity was further stratified into three BMI subgroups: class 1 (30 to <35); class 2 (35 to <40); and class 3 (40) . ** Provider counseling for weight loss, which was part of sponsored survey content featured in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2014, was defined as an affirmative response to the question, Has a doctor or other health professional ever suggested losing weight to help your arthritis or joint symptoms? All analyses accounted for the complex survey design; sampling weights were applied to make estimates represen - tative of the U. S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Weighted numbers and age-standardized prevalences (using the projected 2000 U. S. population for ages 1844, 4564, and 65 years) were calculated for adults with overweight or obesity overall and for selected sociodemographic and healthrelated characteristics for 2002 and 2014. Results were declared significant if t-tests yielded p-values <0. 05 for differences in age-standardized prevalences between 2002 and 2014, and between categories of characteristics in 2014.  https: //www. cdc. gov/obesity/adult/defining. html. ** https: //www. nhlbi. nih. gov/files/docs/guidelines/prctgd_c. pdf.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20. pdf. https: //www. healthypeople. gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/ArthritisOsteoporosis-and-Chronic-Back-Conditions/objectives.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nhis/data-questionnaires-documentation. htm. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 487 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAmong the U. S. adult population, 28. 3 million persons in 2002 and 38. 9 million in 2014 had arthritis and overweight or obesity. From 2002 to 2014, the age-standardized prevalence of receiving provider counseling for weight loss among adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity increased by 10. 4 percentage points from 35. 1% (95% CI = 33. 037. 3) to 45. 5% (95% CI = 42. 948. 1) (p<0. 001) (Table), which met the Healthy People 2020 target of 45. 3%. The prevalence increased by 5. 7 percentage points for adults with arthritis and overweight (from 18. 1% to 23. 8%; p = 0. 006) and 12. 4 percentage points for those with obesity (50. 4% to 62. 8%; p<0. 001) . By obesity subgroup, the prevalence increased 11. 8 percentage points among persons with class 1 obesity (40. 8% to 52. 6%; p<0. 001) and 15. 5 percentage points among those with class 3 obesity (69. 0% to 84. 5%; p<0. 001); the increase among persons with class 2 obesity was not significant (Figure) . In 2014 among adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity, the prevalence of receiving provider weight-loss counseling was significantly higher for females (versus males), those with obesity (versus overweight), those who had ever received provider counseling to engage in physi - cal activity to manage arthritis (versus those who had not), those who had ever taken a self-management class or course (versus those who had not), and those with a primary care provider (versus those without one) (Table) . Discussion From 2002 to 2014, the percentage of adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity who reported receiving provider weight-loss counseling increased by 10. 4 percentage points. These improvements are encouraging; however, approximately 75% of adults with overweight and 50% of those with class 1 obesity are not receiving provider weight-loss counseling. A recent report indicated that 61. 0% of adults with arthritis received provider counseling for physical activity in 2014 (7), more than the 45. 5% reported here for weight loss. Providers might advise for physical activity more frequently than weight loss because the former might be easier to discuss with patients or they might be more aware of the arthritis-specific benefits of physical activity. Findings of the current report indicate that those who are not receiving counseling for weight loss might also not be receiving counsel - ing for physical activity. Nevertheless, to address obesity, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that providers either provide or refer patients to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions that include management strategies (e. g. , goal setting), dietary and physical activity changes, addressing barriers to change, self-monitoring, and strategies to maintain healthy behaviors. The American College of Rheumatology also recommends that provid - ers offer counseling for weight loss and physical activity to adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis. In randomized controlled trials, a  https: //www. uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/Page/Name/ tools-and-resources-for-better-preventive-care. combined exercise and diet intervention resulted in the greatest improvements in weight, pain, joint forces, inflammatory factors, and mobility compared with either intervention alone (4, 8) . In the current study, the percentage of adults with overweight or obesity who received weight-loss counseling was higher among those who had taken a self-management education course than among those who had not. Since the temporal sequencing of provider weight-loss counseling and taking a self-management education course (which includes weight-loss messages) cannot be delineated, this study could not determine whether provider counseling leads persons with arthritis and overweight or obesity to self-management educa - tion courses or vice versa. However, it is possible that persons with arthritis who receive recommendations for healthy behaviors, such as weight loss, from their provider are more amenable to engaging in other self-management behaviors, such as taking a self-management education course or engaging in physical activity. One benefit of self-management education program participation is substantial increases in self-confidence (9), which is an important characteristic that can help adults with arthritis act on counseling to lose weight and be physically active. Combined counseling for weight loss, physical activity, and self-management education might enhance arthritis and other health outcomes. Strategies to increase provider counseling for weight loss include health system interventions (e. g. , electronic medi - cal record clinical decision supports) and provider training. Electronic medical record clinical decision supports are effec - tive in increasing the delivery of nutrition and physical activ - ity counseling and decreasing BMI in children with obesity (10), and similar strategies might translate into weight loss in adult populations. Standardized electronic medical record clinical decision supports could assist provider counseling and referrals to evidence-based, community-delivered weight-loss and physical activity programs, intensive multicomponent interventions, or bariatric specialists, as well as facilitate patient education and help providers follow up on patients weight-loss goals and progress. Increased provider training regarding selfmanagement support strategies can help providers to gain the skills and confidence to provide successful weight-loss counsel - ing. Such training can include formal classroom instruction or use of publicly available online resources for counseling their patients. ***, Many effective strategies, including motiva - tional interviewing, the 5As approach (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, and Arrange), and emphasizing that small changes can have a big impact, are applicable to weight-loss counseling (6) . For example, along with improving pain and mobility (4), a relatively small, but clinically significant, 5. 1% reduction  https: //downloads. cms. gov/files/cmmi/community-basedwellnessrreventionsixthmnthoutcomes-operationalcostrpt. pdf. *** http: //stopobesityalliance. org/wp-content/themes/stopobesityalliance/pdfs/ STOP-Provider-Discussion-Tool. pdf.  https: //health. mo. gov/living/healthcondiseases/obesity/pdf/Toolkit_Adult. pdf.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, NHIS data are self-reported and some character - istics might be susceptible to recall or social desirability bias. Specifically, the latter can lead to underestimation of BMI (2) . Second, low response rates could also introduce response bias; however, sampling weights applied in the analysis include adjustment for nonresponse. Third, using BMI to classify over - weight and obesity risks classifying some persons with a high muscle-to-fat ratio as having overweight or obesity, who might not require counseling. Finally, because 2014 data for provider counseling for weight loss were the most recent available, the prevalence might have changed since then. Reported receipt of provider counseling for weight loss increased significantly among adults with arthritis and over - weight or obesity from 2002 to 2014. Continuing this progress can ensure that the majority of adults in this population receive important messages that can increase their attempts to lose weight. Through combined counseling for weight loss, physi - cal activity, and self-management education, and by making referrals to evidence-based programs, providers can help their patients with arthritis make meaningful improvements in quality-of-life and long-term health outcomes.

Weight loss among adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity can improve pain, function, mobility, and health-related quality of life, and reduce disability. What is added by this report? From 2002 to 2014, the prevalence of health care provider counseling for weight loss among adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity increased by 10. 4 percentage points from 35. 1% to 45. 5%. What are the implications for public health practice? Provider counseling for weight loss in adults with arthritis and overweight or obesity, along with other health behavior counsel - ing, including physical activity and self-management education, might increase attempts at weight loss and eventual success. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 491 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionProgress Toward Measles Elimination  Western Pacific Region, 20132017 Jos E. Hagan, MD1; Jennifer L. Kriss, PhD2; Yoshihiro Takashima, MD, PhD1; Kayla Mae L. Mariano1; Roberta Pastore, MD1; Varja Grabovac, MSc1; Alya J. Dabbagh, PhD3; James L. Goodson, MPH2 In 2005, the Regional Committee for the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR) * established a goal for measles elimination by 2012 (1) . To achieve this goal, the 37 WPR countries and areas implemented the recommended strategies in the WPR Plan of Action for Measles Elimination (2) and the Field Guidelines for Measles Elimination (3) . The strategies include 1) achieving and maintaining 95% coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) through routine immuniza - tion services and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), when required; 2) conducting high-quality case-based measles surveillance, including timely and accurate testing of specimens to confirm or discard suspected cases and detect measles virus for genotyping and molecular analysis; and 3) establishing and main - taining measles outbreak preparedness to ensure rapid response and appropriate case management. This report updates the previous report (4) and describes progress toward measles elimination in WPR during 20132017. During 20132016, estimated regional coverage with the first MCV dose (MCV1) decreased from 97% to 96%, and coverage with the routine second MCV dose (MCV2) increased from 91% to 93%. Eighteen (50%) countries achieved 95% MCV1 coverage in 2016. Seven (39%) of 18 nationwide SIAs during 20132017 reported achieving 95% administrative coverage. After a record low of 5. 9 cases per million population in 2012, measles incidence increased during 20132016 to a high of 68. 9 in 2014, because of outbreaks in the Philippines and Vietnam, as well as increased incidence in China, and then declined to 5. 2 in 2017. To achieve measles elimination in WPR, additional measures are needed to strengthen immunization programs to achieve high population immunity, maintain high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensure outbreak preparedness and prompt response to contain outbreaks. Immunization Activities MCV1 and MCV2 coverage data are reported annually to WHO and the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) from * The Western Pacific Region, one of the six regions of the World Health Organization, consists of 37 countries and areas with a population of approximately 1. 8 billion, including American Samoa (USA), Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia (France), Guam (USA), Hong Kong (China), Japan, Kiribati, Laos, Macao (China), Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Nauru, New Caledonia (France), New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands (UK), Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Tokelau (New Zealand), Tonga, T uvalu, Vanuatu, Vietnam, and Wallis and Futuna (France) .  Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a defined geographical area (e. g. , region or country) for 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system. 36 of the 37 WPR countries and areas. WHO and UNICEF estimate vaccination coverage for 27 countries/areas in the region, using annual government-reported survey and admin - istrative data; for the remaining areas and territories, reported coverage data from immunization program monitoring are used. Regional MCV1 and MCV2 coverage rates were maintained at 95% and >90%, respectively, during 20132016 (Table 1) . In 2016, 18 (50%) of 36 countries achieved 95% MCV1 cover - age, and 11 (31%) reported 95% coverage with both MCV1 and MCV2. As of 2017, only two (5%) WPR countries and areas (Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) had not yet introduced MCV2. During 20132017, 18 national SIAs were conducted (Table 2); in addition, Japan conducted annual SIAs targeting schoolchildren aged 13 years and 17 years. Reported vaccination coverage was 95% in seven (39%) of the nationwide SIAs. Surveillance Activities Case-based measles and rubella surveillance data are reported monthly to WHO from all WPR countries and areas; 21 countries and areas of the Pacific Islands report data as one epidemiologic block. ** The WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network supports surveillance by provid - ing laboratory confirmation and genotyping of reported cases. Suspected measles cases are confirmed based on laboratory findings, an epidemiologic link, or clinical criteria. Key indicators of surveillance performance include 1) the number of suspected measles cases discarded as nonmeasles (target: 2 per 100, 000 population); 2) the proportion of second-level  The Pitcairn Islands, with a population of approximately 50 persons, does not report immunization coverage data to WHO/UNICEF.  SIAs are generally carried out using two target age ranges. An initial, nationwide catch-up SIA targets children aged 9 months14 years, with the goal of eliminating susceptibility to measles in the general population. Periodic follow-up SIAs then target children born since the last SIA. Follow-up SIAs are generally conducted nationwide every 24 years and generally target children aged 959 months; their goal is to eliminate any measles susceptibility that has developed in recent birth cohorts and to protect children who did not respond to the first measles vaccination. ** The epidemiologic block of countries and areas of the Pacific Islands includes American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, T uvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna.  Cases that meet the WHO clinical case definition for measles for which no adequate specimen was collected and cannot be epidemiologically linked to a laboratoryconfirmed case of measles. Before 2013, in WPR these cases were classified as clinically confirmed. Beginning in 2013, this classification was renamed clinically compatible and cases were only classified confirmed if they were laboratoryconfirmed or epidemiologically linked. The change in terms reflects the recognition in WPR that clinically compatible cases represent a weakness in surveillance.

From 2013 to 2017, the percentage of suspected cases with adequate investigations decreased from 92% to 89%; the percentage of suspected cases with adequate specimens col - lected for laboratory testing decreased from 90% to 89%; and the proportion of blood specimens received by the laboratory with results available within 7 days increased from 84% to 98% (Supplementary Table, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/53519) . Measles Incidence and Genotypes WPR experienced a resurgence of measles during 20132016 (Figure), after a record low incidence of 5. 9 cases per million population in 2012. During the resurgence, incidence of seasonal endemic measles virus transmission in China increased, and large-scale nationwide outbreaks occurred in other countries with endemic measles (Malaysia and the Philippines) . During 20132016, after importations from countries with endemic disease, measles outbreaks also occurred in countries that had been verified as having eliminated endemic measles virus transmission (Australia, Cambodia, Japan, and South Korea), including a large-scale outbreak in Mongolia. An increase in importations also led to outbreaks in several countries with endemic, low-incidence measles, including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Solomon Islands, and Vietnam. Annual regional measles incidence per 1 million population increased from 19. 2 in 2013 to 68. 9 in 2014, and then decreased to 5. 2 in 2017, a historic low (Table 1) . The predominantly detected circulating measles virus genotypes were H1 in China, B3 in the Philippines, and both D8 and D9 in Malaysia and Vietnam. Regional Verification of Measles Elimination After the request of the Western Pacific Regional Committee (5) for WHO to establish a formal mechanism for verification of elimination through the Regional Verification Commission, verification guidelines were finalized in April 2013 and revised TABLE 2.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 494 MMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionin 2016 to include verification of rubella elimination. As of the September 2017 Regional Verification Commission meeting, a total of eight (47%) WPR countries and areas (Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Hong Kong [China], Japan, Macao [China], New Zealand, and South Korea) have been verified as having achieved elimination of measles (6) . After a nation - wide outbreak in Mongolia during 20152016 that lasted longer than 12 months, the Regional Verification Commission determined that endemic measles virus transmission had been reestablished in Mongolia (7) . Discussion The 20132016 measles resurgence in WPR was attributed to three factors. First, increased measles virus transmission occurred in countries with endemic disease (e. g. , China, Malaysia, and the Philippines) . Second, large-scale outbreaks occurred after impor - tation of measles into countries with endemic, low-incidence measles. Third, multiple measles importations into countries or areas that had achieved elimination occurred, particularly in Mongolia, where a large outbreak persisted for >12 months and endemic measles virus transmission was reestablished. Measles incidence in WPR declined to a historic low of 5. 2 in 2017 because of achievement of control of the outbreaks in Vietnam (20132014) and Mongolia (20152016), burnout of the outbreak in the Philippines (20132014), and Chinas accelerated control of measles after the 20102011 outbreak. However, the resurgence during 20132016 revealed ongoing and emerging challenges that need to be addressed. These chal - lenges include changing measles epidemiology, with increased measles incidence occurring among adolescents, young adults, and infants too young to be vaccinated as well as heterogeneity of measles epidemiology among subnational areas and specific groups at risk within countries with large populations. In addi - tion, the resurgence revealed systems weaknesses: immunization FIGURE.

A case of measles was laboratoryconfirmed when measles-specific immunoglobulin M antibody was detected in serum, measles-specific RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction, or measles virus was isolated in cell culture from a person who was not vaccinated during the 30 days before rash onset. A case of measles was confirmed by epidemiologic linkage when linked in time and place to a laboratory-confirmed measles case without serologic confirmation. During 20132017, a case of measles meeting the WHO clinical case definition but without a specimen collected could be reported as clinically compatible. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 495 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionprograms were unable to achieve and maintain high population immunity through routine immunization service delivery, and some national laboratories had insufficient capacity to conduct timely serologic testing during outbreaks. The challenges iden - tified also included inadequately developed and implemented policies and processes for preventing measles resurgence and morbidity after virus introduction to the population, including delayed outbreak investigation, insufficient outbreak response, and nosocomial measles virus transmission. Finally, the resur - gence revealed a need for greater involvement of local govern - ments, private sectors, societies, and communities. To address these challenges and to accelerate measles elimi - nation efforts in WPR, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific prepared a new strategy and plan of action for measles and rubella elimination in the Western Pacific that was endorsed by the 68th meeting of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2017 (5) . The document details 31 strategies with accompanying activities in the following eight areas: 1) overall planning; 2) immunization services; 3) epidemiologic surveillance; 4) laboratory support; 5) program review and risk assessment; 6) outbreak preparedness and response; 7) partnerships, advocacy, information, education and communication, and social mobilization; and 8) progress monitoring and verification of elimination. The new regional strategy is designed to address specific challenges facing WPR countries and to serve as a resource for development of national plans of action (and subnational plans for countries with large populations), tailored to country-specific opportunities for achieving and maintaining measles elimination. Collective efforts among WPR countries are important for achieving regional measles elimination. Working together to follow the recommended strategies and actions in the Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination could help WPR countries in their efforts to strengthen immunization programs to achieve and sustain high population immunity, maintain high-quality surveillance for rapid case detection and confirmation, and ensure outbreak preparedness and prompt response to contain outbreaks.

Most countries in the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region (WPR) have made substantial progress toward measles elimination. What is added by this report? During 20132016, a resurgence of measles occurred in WPR, with large-scale outbreaks in Mongolia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, and increased endemic transmission in China; in 2014, annual incidence increased to 68. 9 cases per million. However, with control of the outbreaks, in 2017, incidence decreased to a new historic low (5. 2 per million) . What are the implications for public health practice? Achieving high reported vaccination coverage is not sufficient for achieving regional measles elimination. Efforts by WPR countries are needed to establish high population immunity, build strong immunization systems, maintain high-quality surveillance, and improve outbreak preparedness and response.

Petersen, MD1 On May 1, 2018, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (https: //www. cdc. gov/mmwr) . Abstract Introduction: Vectorborne diseases are major causes of death and illness worldwide. In the United States, the most common vectorborne pathogens are transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes, including those causing Lyme disease; Rocky Mountain spotted fever; and West Nile, dengue, and Zika virus diseases. This report examines trends in occurrence of nationally reportable vectorborne diseases during 20042016. Methods: Data reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System for 16 notifiable vectorborne diseases during 20042016 were analyzed; findings were tabulated by disease, vector type, location, and year. Results: A total 642, 602 cases were reported. The number of annual reports of tickborne bacterial and protozoan diseases more than doubled during this period, from >22, 000 in 2004 to >48, 000 in 2016. Lyme disease accounted for 82% of all tickborne disease reports during 20042016. The occurrence of mosquitoborne diseases was marked by virus epidemics. T ransmission in Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa accounted for most reports of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus diseases; West Nile virus was endemic, and periodically epidemic, in the continental United States. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Vectorborne diseases are a large and growing public health problem in the United States, characterized by geographic specificity and frequent pathogen emergence and introduction. Differences in distribution and transmission dynamics of tickborne and mosquitoborne diseases are often rooted in biologic differences of the vectors. To effectively reduce transmission and respond to outbreaks will require major national improvement of surveillance, diagnostics, reporting, and vector control, as well as new tools, including vaccines. Introduction Vectors are blood-feeding insects and ticks capable of transmit - ting pathogens between hosts. Wide varieties of pathogens have evolved to exploit vector transmission, including some viruses, bacteria, rickettsia, protozoa, and helminths. Dengue viruses are estimated to infect nearly 400 million persons worldwide each year (1), and malaria (2) is a major cause of pediatric mortal - ity in equatorial Africa. Plague (3) and rickettsioses (4) cause deadly epidemics abroad. In the United States, 16 vectorborne diseases are reportable to state and territorial health departments, which are encouraged to report them to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) . Among the diseases on the list that are caused by indigenous pathogens are Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi); West Nile, dengue and Zika virus diseases; plague (Yersinia pestis); and spotted fever rickettsioses (e. g. , Rickettsia rickettsii) . Malaria and yellow fever are no longer transmitted in the United States but have the potential to be rein - troduced. As a group, vectorborne diseases in the United States are notable for their wide distribution and resistance to control. A Food and Drug Administrationapproved vaccine is available to prevent only one of the notifiable diseases, yellow fever. Despite the dissimilarities among vectorborne pathogens and the many vector species that can transmit them, commonalities exist. Vectorborne disease epidemiology is complex because of environmental influences on the biology and behavior of the vectors. The longevity, distribution, biting habits, and propagation of vectors, which ultimately affect the intensity of transmission, depend on environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and shelter. Most vectorborne pathogens are zoonoses, often with wild animal reservoirs, such as rodents or birds, making them difficult or impossible to eliminate. Arthropod vectors can bridge the gap between animals and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 497 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhumans that would not ordinarily intersect, as happens in Lyme disease, plague, and West Nile virus (WNV), facilitating the introduction of emerging animal pathogens to humans. The pace of emergence of new or obscure vectorborne pathogens through introduction or belated recognition appears to be increas - ing. Since 2004, these have included two previously unknown, lifethreatening tickborne RNA viruses, Heartland (5) and Bourbon (6), both reported from the U. S. Midwest. A tickborne relapsing fever agent, Borrelia miyamotoi, first described in Japan, has been found widely distributed in the United States (7) and another bacterial spirochete, Borrelia mayonii (8) was discovered in the upper U. S. Midwest. T wo tickborne spotted fever Rickettsiae, R. parkeri (9) and Rickettsia species 364D (10), and a tickborne Ehrlichia (E. muris eauclairensis) (11) were discovered to be pathogenic to humans. The mosquitoborne viruses chikungunya and Zika were introduced to Puerto Rico in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Zika virus is emblem - atic of the dangers of emergence. Zika was one of a number of obscure, mosquitoborne viruses known to be pathogenic to humans that are rarely encountered or studied (12) . In the 60 years follow - ing its discovery in a monkey in Uganda, it was seldom reported as a human pathogen. In 2016, there were >36, 000 cases reported in Puerto Rico, limited autochthonous, or local, transmission in Florida and Texas, and nearly 5, 000 cases among travelers to the United States (13) . The teratogenic consequences of the 20152017 epidemic in the region of the Americas were unexpected. CDC examined trends of reported vectorborne disease cases in the United States during 20042016; this report discusses the challenges of prevention and control and highlights opportunities for vectorborne disease preparedness at the state and local level. Methods Vectorborne disease data from NNDSS were retrieved from 2004, the first year that both neuroinvasive and nonneuroin - vasive arthropodborne viral (arboviral) diseases were nation - ally notifiable, through 2016, the most recent year for which complete data are available (https: //wwwn. cdc. gov/nndss/ conditions/notifiable) . Data were tabulated by disease, vector type (i. e. , mosquito, tick, or flea), state or territory of residence, and year. State health departments report human disease cases using standard surveillance case definitions that include clini - cal and laboratory criteria. For some diseases, data reported according to Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definitions as confirmed or probable have been combined; autochthonous and travel-associated cases have been analyzed together by state or territory in which they were found. Chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and Babesia cases became notifiable after 2004; only those data in NNDSS are presented. Although dengue became nationally notifiable only in 2010, earlier national data were available from CDCs Dengue Branch and are included in this analysis. Results Nearly 650, 000 cases of vectorborne disease were reported during 20042016 (Table) . Tickborne diseases, which accounted for >75% of reports, occur throughout the conti - nental United States, but predominate in the eastern part of the country and in areas along the Pacific Coast (Figure 1) . Reported cases of tickborne disease have doubled in the 13-year analysis period, with Lyme disease accounting for 82% of cumulative reported tickborne disease. The combined inci - dence of reported anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which are tick - borne bacterial diseases, rose almost every year, as did spotted fever; babesiosis, a tickborne parasitic infection that has been notifiable since 2011, also contributed to the rise. Endemic plague, a fleaborne disease that is transmitted mostly in the rural southwestern United States, did not exceed 17 cases in a year. T ularemia and ehrlichiosis are geographically widespread but more prevalent in the central United States. By contrast, the occurrence of mosquitoborne viruses was dis - persed (Figure 2) and punctuated by epidemics (Table) (Figure 3) . WNV was the most commonly transmitted mosquitoborne disease in the continental United States. Its most notable epidemic dur - ing 20042016 occurred in 2012, especially in Texas. Epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses were mostly confined to the U. S. territories. All four dengue viruses were endemic in Puerto Rico, which was subject to cyclical epidemics, notably in 2010 and during 20122013. Puerto Ricos first chikungunya virus epidemic peaked in 2014, followed by Zika virus in 2016. T ravelers infected in the territories and Latin America accounted for >90% of the dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus disease cases identi - fied in the states and District of Columbia; limited autochthonous transmission of dengue occurred in Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, and of chikungunya and Zika viruses in Texas and Florida. Malaria is diagnosed in approximately 1, 500 travelers yearly but no autoch - thonous transmission was documented during 20042016. Conclusions and Comments These data indicate persistent, locality-specific risks and a rising threat from emerging vectorborne diseases, which have increasingly encumbered local and state health departments tasked with preventing, detecting, reporting, and controlling them. The overall case number masks two distinct trends. Epidemics characterize the mosquitoborne viruses. WNV trans - mission is effectively limited to the continental United States, whereas most dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus transmission occurred in the territories. By contrast, the increasing reports of tickborne disease, which occurs almost exclusively in the continental United States, has been gradual. The area at risk for Lyme disease has been expanding (14) . Although Lyme disease accounts for 82% of all reported tickborne diseases, spotted fevers, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis have become Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 498 MMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionincreasingly prevalent. Diseases caused by pathogens that were relatively uncommon during the 13-year analysis period remain important because of their historical potential to cause epidemics (e. g. , St. Louis encephalitis virus), their high case fatality rates (e. g. , eastern equine encephalitis virus), or their potential as bioterror agents (e. g. , plague and tularemia) . The reported data substantially underestimate disease occur - rence. NNDSS relies on a person seeking care, a clinician requesting appropriate tests, and providers or laboratories reporting to public health authorities. Recent data from clini - cal and laboratory diagnoses estimate that Lyme disease infects approximately 300, 000 Americans yearly, eightto tenfold more than the number reported (15, 16) . Many arbovirus infections result in minimal symptoms. It has been estimated that 3070 nonneuroinvasive arboviral disease cases occur for every WNV neuroinvasive disease case reported (17) . Based on the number of neuroinvasive disease cases reported in 2016, between 39, 300 and 91, 700 nonneuroinvasive disease cases of WNV would have been expected to occur, but only 840 (1%2%) were reported (17) . The dynamics of vectorborne pathogen transmission are sig - nificantly influenced by the characteristics of vector, reservoir, and host. Tickborne pathogens rarely cause sudden epidemics because humans are typically incidental hosts who do not trans - mit further, and tick mobility is mostly limited to that of its ani - mal hosts. For ticks, the prolonged life cycle and widely separated blood feeds limit opportunities for pathogen transmission. Ixodes scapularis, for example, an important vector of B. burgdorferi, might feed on blood once in a year, but this is compensated for by their broad host preferences and the ability of single ticks to transmit multiple pathogen species. In contrast, the more mobile female mosquitoes feed on blood every 4872 hours. TABLE. Vectorborne disease cases reported to National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System  U.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 499 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are typically transmitted directly between humans by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, after about a weeks extrinsic incubation period, resulting in explosive epidemics. WNV is one of the few purely zoonotic vectorborne pathogens with epidemic potential; humans are only at risk from mosquitoes that have fed on viremic birds. There must be a coincidence of flocks with a high prevalence of infection near humans when vector mosquito species are abundant. Bird movement was responsible for WNVs rapid spread across the United States after its introduction to New York City in 1999. The presence of competent vector species does not alone assure transmission. Ae. aegypti, whose range has been expanding, FIGURE 1. Reported cases* of tickborne disease  U.

A total of 89 fleaborne disease cases (plague) were reported during 20042018, ranging from two cases in 2010 to 16 cases in 2015. The cases are not depicted on the figure. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 500 MMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionmight now be present in up to 38 states (18), but despite the frequent arrival of travelers infected with dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses, autochthonous transmission has been rare. No local transmission of malaria resulted from the importation of about 1, 500 cases annually, even though Anopheles mosquitoes are present in much of the United States. Although the range of Ixodes scapularis extends over much of the eastern United States, transmission of Lyme disease, B. microti babesiosis, and Powassan virus are rare outside of the Northeast and upper Midwest regions. Whatever the biologic, economic, behavioral, or land use reasons for these differences, the presence of vectors with proven or possible capacity to transmit a wide range of pathogens leaves the United States susceptible to outbreaks of exotic vectorborne diseases, as demonstrated by the limited local transmission of dengue and Zika viruses in Florida and Texas. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, underreporting might have substantially limited the number of cases analyzed. As noted, the number of Lyme disease cases reported to NNDSS is estimated to represent a fraction of incident cases. In addition, because many patients with dengue, nonneuroinvasive West Nile, and Zika virus infections experience mild symptoms, they might not seek medical attention. Second, not all the diseases described in this report were reportable for the full 13-year analysis period or from all states and territories; babe - siosis data are only available from 2011 from some states. Finally, although CDC collected national dengue data before 2011, the first year it was officially designated as notifiable, it is possible a higher proportion of cases were reported after reporting became mandatory. Overall, it is likely the actual number of vectorborne disease cases substantially exceeds those described in this report. In the face of increasing incidence and threat from novel patho - gens, the burden on local and state public health departments has increased. Critical to effectively preventing or responding to disease outbreaks is sensitive disease and vector surveillance, backed by well-organized, well-prepared, and sustained vector control opera - tions. Good surveillance and reporting depend on rapid, accurate diagnostic confirmation; more sensitive and specific tests that can be used locally are needed. Vaccines against Lyme disease, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, goals of intense research and development, could reduce risk from those major threats. The tools for vector control are limited but can be effective when implemented rapidly. Ticks have been especially difficult to control (19), increasing the responsibility for personal protective measures. Nearly all public vector control operations in the United States are locally funded and operated. Networks of vector control operatives are essential to sup - port threat reduction and counter outbreaks, yet in a recent national survey 84% of 1, 083 local mosquito control organizations reported lacking one or more of five core vector control competencies (20) . Resources available to assist state and local health departments could be used to develop vector control program competencies. Reducing vectorborne disease incidence and responding to outbreaks is a large and complex challenge. CDC is using two strategies to mitigate vectorborne threats: advancing innovation and discovery and rebuilding comprehensive vector control programs that have eroded over time (20) . CDC works with states, territories, and tribal councils to compile surveillance data, develop strategies and guidance, and educate the public about specific threats and prevention measures for populations at risk. Expanding sustainable vectorborne disease prevention Key Points  A total of 642, 602 cases of 16 diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites transmitted through the bites of mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas were reported to CDC during 20042016. Indications are that cases were substantially underreported.  Tickborne disease cases more than doubled in 13 years and were 77% of all vectorborne disease reports. Lyme disease accounted for 82% of all tickborne cases, but spotted fever rickettsioses, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis/ ehrlichiosis cases also increased.  Tickborne diseases predominated in the eastern continental United States and areas along the Pacific coast. Mosquitoborne dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses were almost exclusively transmitted in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U. S. Virgin Islands, where they were periodically epidemic. West Nile virus, also occasionally epidemic, was widely distributed in the continental United States, where it is the major mosquitoborne disease.  During 20042016, nine vectorborne human diseases were reported for the first time from the United States and U. S. territories. The discovery or introduction of novel vectorborne agents will be a continuing threat.  Vectorborne diseases have been difficult to prevent and control. A Food and Drug Administrationapproved vaccine is available only for yellow fever virus. Many of the vectorborne diseases, including Lyme disease and West Nile virus, have animal reservoirs. Insecticide resistance is widespread and increasing.  Preventing and responding to vectorborne disease outbreaks are high priorities for CDC and will require additional capacity at state and local levels for tracking, diagnosing, and reporting cases; controlling vectors; and preventing transmission.

The Texas Department of State Health Services then contacted CDC to report that a sample of these rattlesnake pills yielded Salmonella Oranienburg. The Salmonella serotype isolated from the patient was not related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to that isolated from the rattlesnake pills. PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne dis - ease surveillance, identified numerous isolates with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from that of the rattlesnake pill isolate. * Whole genome sequencing (WGS) indicated that the Salmonella found in the sample of rattlesnake pills was closely related genetically to an isolate from a patient in Kansas. This close genetic relationship makes it likely that the Kansas patient became ill from consumption of rattlesnake pills. Because the Salmonella serotype isolated from the patient was not related by PFGE to that isolated from the rattlesnake pills, the defini - tive cause of the Texas patients illness was not ascertained; this patient was unable to be reinterviewed, and no additional samples were able to be collected. Rattlesnake pills, which contain encapsulated dehydrated and pulverized rattlesnake meat, are marketed as remedies for various conditions, ranging from cancer to acne. Rattlesnake pills are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are sometimes labeled by the manufacturer as natural. Rattlesnake pills can be found in alternative medicine and health food stores and roadside markets and can be purchased through Internet retailers. The Kansas patient was initially interviewed using a stan - dard enteric illness questionnaire, which included a question about vitamins and supplements. This patient indicated tak - ing other supplements but did not report taking rattlesnake pills. After learning the patients isolate was closely related to the rattlesnake pill isolate by WGS, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reinterviewed the patient on December 17, 2017, specifically asking about less common * https: //www. cdc. gov/pulsenet.  https: //www. cdc. gov/pulsenet/pathogens/wgs. html.  https: //www. fda. gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm466588. htm. supplements including rattlesnake pills. During the second interview, the patient reported having traveled to the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, and purchasing pastillas de vbora de cascabel (rattlesnake pills) . The patient believed the pills to be homemade and consumed five pills; the patient had no remaining pills, so it could not be determined whether the source was the same as for the Texas patients pills. At the time of this report, no additional infections of Salmonella related to the Kansas patient or Texas pill sample have been identified; no other isolates were related to rattlesnake pills by WGS. Reptiles and their meat can carry Salmonella species that cause illness. Previous outbreak investigations have identified rattlesnake pills as a source of human Salmonella infections; a majority of illnesses occurred in persons with cancer (14) who were taking the rattlesnake pills for medicinal purposes, and most of those infections were associated with S. arizonae. This is the first report of S. Oranienburg infection associated with consumption of rattlesnake pills. Persons with compromised immune systems, including those with human immunode - ficiency virus infection or who are receiving chemotherapy, pregnant women, children aged <5 years, and adults aged >60 years are more likely to develop a severe Salmonella infection that can result in hospitalization or even death from consum - ing a contaminated food or supplement. The Food and Drug Administration does not review rattlesnake pills for safety or effectiveness. ** Persons choosing to take rattlesnake pills, espe - cially persons at higher risk for severe Salmonella infections, should be aware of the risk for salmonellosis associated with their consumption. Consultation with a licensed health care provider to discuss potential risks and benefits is recommended before taking any supplements.

Increase in Hepatitis A Virus Infections  Marshall Islands, 20162017 Megan G. Hofmeister, MD1, 2; Jill A. McCready, MSPH3; Ruth LinkGelles, PhD1, 2; Blanche Greene Cramer, DrPH2, 4; Leisha D. Nolen, MD, PhD5; Helentina Garstang, DCHMS6; Monique A. Foster, MD1 In mid-September 2016, a case of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection was reported to the Marshall Islands Ministry of Health and Human Services (MOHHS) . On November 4, MOHHS received laboratory confirmation of four additional cases, prompting activation of an outbreak investigation by the MOHHS Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet) team and solicitation of technical assistance from the Pacific Island Health Officers Association, the World Health Organization, and CDC. CDC began participating in the investigation by providing technical assistance remotely at that time. CDC provided remote assistance throughout the course of the investigation. In April 2017, the CDC-affiliated coauthors traveled to the Marshall Islands to provide in-person technical assistance. To characterize the outbreak, the MOHHS EPINet Team, with assistance from CDC, conducted an investigation through in-person interviews and medical chart abstractions. A probable HAV outbreak case was defined as an acute illness with onset of any signs or symptoms consistent with acute viral hepati - tis (e. g. , fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dark urine, clay-colored stool, or abdominal pain) on or after September 1, 2016, and either jaundice or elevated serum aminotransferase levels; a confirmed case met the probable case definition and also had either a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HAV on laboratory testing or an epidemio - logic link to a confirmed case. * From September 2016 (epidemiologic week 37) through July 2017 (epidemiologic week 28), 194 outbreak-associated hepatitis A cases (168 confirmed and 26 probable) were reported by MOHHS (Figure) . Illness onset dates ranged from September 12, 2016, through July 11, 2017. The median age of infected persons was 8 years (range = 276 years), 57% of patients were male, 91% were Marshallese, and 11% were hospitalized. No deaths were reported. Persons aged <25 years accounted for 90% of cases, and 92% of patients were residents of the capital, Majuro. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms were jaundice (92%), nausea (76%), anorexia (75%), and dark urine (68%) . Clay-colored stool (10%) was less commonly reported. Complete contact information was available for 102 (53%) patients. A total of 1, 143 contacts were identified, with a mean of 11 contacts identified per patient (range = 260) . Among the identified contacts, 902 (79%) received postexposure pro - phylaxis (PEP) with hepatitis A vaccine. Some contacts were identified outside the recommended PEP window of 14 days after exposure, and 14 contacts were infants who were too young to be vaccinated (1) . Seven contacts refused vaccination. The EPINet team disseminated public information about the outbreak and recommendations on hygiene and vaccination through radio shows, mass text messages, posters, and school presentations; developed standardized case reporting and interview tools; and expanded case finding through investiga - tion of contacts. Hepatitis A vaccine is not currently included in the Marshall Islands routine childhood immunization schedule. Marshall Islands began immunization of contacts of patients with hepatitis A in January 2017 and then launched a comprehensive immunization campaign targeting schoolaged children on Majuro in February 2017, which ultimately covered approximately 70% of the total kindergarten through eighth grade student population. Once the vaccine supply was replenished in April 2017, a second immunization campaign was directed at high school students aged 1419 years on Majuro. In total, approximately 12, 500 doses of hepatitis A vaccine were administered to school-aged children and adult contacts of patients in response to the outbreak. No additional cases were reported as of August 30, 2017. Before this outbreak, the last HAV outbreak in the Marshall Islands occurred approximately 25 years ago. Since then, approximately five hepatitis A cases per year have been reported (MOHHS, unpublished data, 2017) . HAV infec - tion is typically acquired through fecal-oral transmission, either from direct person-to-person contact or consumption of contaminated food or water. In this outbreak, transmission occurred primarily through direct person-to-person contact, and despite extensive measures, the initial source of HAV infection was not identified. HAV infection occurs in three distinct epidemiologic pat - terns (high, intermediate, and low endemicity) associated with hygiene and sanitation, access to clean drinking water, household crowding, and socioeconomic conditions (2) . As socioeconomic conditions and sanitation improve, areas transi - tion from high to intermediate endemicity, which is associated with an increased incidence of symptomatic clinical disease and potential for outbreaks. Hepatitis Arelated hospitaliza - tions and mortality also increase as the age of infection shifts Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / May 4, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 17 505 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionfrom early childhood, when disease is typically asymptomatic or mild, to adolescence and adulthood, when illness is more likely to be severe (2) . Before this outbreak, HAV was thought to be endemic in the Marshall Islands; however, this outbreak demonstrates that the country might be undergoing an epidemiologic transi - tion toward intermediate endemicity (3) . Health officials are evaluating the potential costs and benefits of incorporating routine hepatitis A vaccination in Marshall Islands as a means of reducing ongoing transmission and preventing outbreaks.
