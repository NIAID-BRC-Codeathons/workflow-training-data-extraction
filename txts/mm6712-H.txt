Rudd, MSPH1; Sarah Bacon, PhD1 During 19992015, 568, 699 persons died from drug overdoses in the United States. * Drug overdose deaths in the United States increased 11. 4% from 2014 to 2015 resulting in 52, 404 deaths in 2015, including 33, 091 (63. 1%) that involved an opioid. The largest rate increases from 2014 to 2015 occurred among deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (synthetic opioids) (72. 2%) (1) . Because of demographic and geographic variations in overdose deaths involving different drugs (2, 3),  CDC examined age-adjusted death rates for overdoses involving all opioids, opioid sub - categories (i. e. , prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids),  cocaine, and psychostimulants with abuse potential (psychostimulants) by demographics, urbanization levels, and in 31 states and the District of Columbia (DC) . There were 63, 632 drug overdose deaths in 2016; 42, 249 (66. 4%) involved an opioid.  From 2015 to 2016, deaths increased across all drug categories examined. The largest overall rate increases occurred among deaths involving cocaine (52. 4%) and synthetic opioids (100%), likely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (2, 3) . Increases were observed across demographics, urbaniza - tion levels, and states and DC. The opioid overdose epidemic in the United States continues to worsen. A multifaceted approach, with faster and more comprehensive surveillance, is needed to track emerging threats to prevent and respond to the overdose epidemic through naloxone availability, safe prescribing practices, harm-reduction services, linkage into * https: //wonder. cdc. gov.  https: //www. cdc. gov/drugoverdose/pdf/pubs/2017-cdc-drug-surveillancereport. pdf.  Natural opioids include morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids include drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. Methadone is a synthetic opioid. Synthetic opioids, other than methadone, include drugs such as tramadol and fentanyl. Heroin is an illicit opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db294. htm. treatment, and more collaboration between public health and public safety agencies. Drug overdose deaths were identified in the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files, ** using the International Classification of Diseases, T enth Revision (ICD-10), based on ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes X4044 (unintentional), X6064 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10Y14 (undetermined intent) . Among deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the type of drug or drug category is indicated by the following ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: opioids (T40. 0, T40. 1, T40. 2, T40. 3, ** https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data. htm.

Some deaths involved more than one type of drug; these deaths were included in the rates for each drug category. Therefore, categories are not mutually exclusive.  Age-adjusted overdose death rates were examined for 2015 and 2016 for all opioids, opioid subcategories (prescription opioids [i. e. , natural/semisynthetic opioids and methadone] (4), heroin, and synthetic opioids), cocaine, and psychostimu - lants in the United States and by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, urbanization level, *** and state. State-level analyses included  T40. 0 (opium) and T40. 6 (other and unspecified nar cotics) .  For example, a death involving both a synthetic opioid other than methadone and heroin would be included in both the synthetic other than methadone and heroin death rates.  Age-adjusted death rates wer e calculated by applying age-specific death rates to the 2000 U. S. Census standard population age distribution. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04. pdf. *** Categories of 2013 NCHS Urban-R ural Classification Scheme for Counties (https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural. htm) : Large central metro: Counties in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of 1 million population that 1) contain the entire population of largest principal city of the MSA, or 2) have their entire population contained in the largest principal city of the MSA, or 3) contain at least 250, 000 inhabitants of any principal city of the MSA; Large fringe metro: Counties in MSAs of 1 million population that did not qualify as large central metro counties; Medium metro: Counties in MSAs of populations of 250, 000999, 999; Small metro: Counties in MSAs of populations <250, 000; Micropolitan (nonmetropolitan counties) : counties in micropolitan statistical areas; Noncore (nonmetropolitan counties) : nonmetropolitan counties that did not qualify as micropolitan. 31 states and DC that met the following criteria: 1) 80% of drug overdose death certificates named at least one specific drug in 2015 and 2016; 2) change from 2015 to 2016 in the percent - age of death certificates reporting at least one specific drug was <10 percentage points; and 3) 20 deaths occurred during 2015 and 2016 in at least two drug categories examined. These inclusion criteria were selected to ensure accurate examination of death rates and increases. Relative change in age-adjusted rates and absolute change were calculated. Significance was assessed using z-tests when the number of deaths was 100 (p<0. 05) and nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on a gamma distribution when the number of deaths was <100.  In the United States, 63, 632 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2016; the age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths increased significantly (21. 5%) from 16. 3 in 2015 to 19. 8 in 2016. Opioids were involved in 42, 249 (66. 4%) drug overdose deaths (13. 3 per 100, 000 population) in 2016, representing a 27. 9% rate increase from 2015 (Table 1) . These increases primarily  States whose reporting of any specific drug or drugs involved in an overdose changed by 10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016 were excluded because drug-specific overdose numbers and rates might have changed substantially from 2015 to 2016 as a result of changes in reporting.  Z-tests were used if the number of deaths was 100, and a p-value of <0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2015 or 2016. Note that the method of comparing confidence intervals is a conservative method for statistical significance; caution should be observed when interpreting a nonsignificant difference when the lower and upper limits being compared overlap only slightly. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / March 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 351 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwere driven by deaths involving synthetic opioids, for which the rate doubled from 2015 to 2016 (Table 2) . Rates of overdose deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin increased by 10. 6% and 19. 5%, respectively (Table 1) (Table 2), and rates of overdose deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants increased by 52. 4% and 33. 3%, respectively (Table 3) . From 2015 to 2016, opioid-involved deaths increased in males and females and among persons aged 15 years, whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders. The largest rela - tive rate change occurred among blacks (56. 1%) (Table 1) . The largest absolute rate increases of opioid-involved deaths and deaths involving synthetic opioids occurred among males aged 2544 years and persons aged 2534 years. However, deaths involving synthetic opioids increased in every subgroup exam - ined (Table 2) . Rates involving prescription opioids, heroin, cocaine, and psychostimulants increased for both sexes, whites, blacks, and most age groups (Table 1) (Table 2) (Table 3) . Counties in large central and fringe metro areas experienced the largest absolute increases in deaths involving prescription and synthetic opioids, heroin, and cocaine; micropolitan areas experienced the largest increase in rates involving psychostimu - lants (Table 1) (Table 2) (Table 3) . Opioid death rates differed across the 31 states and DC, with synthetic opioids driving increases in many states.  Although several states experienced increases across drug categories, in many, the changes from 2015 to 2016 were not significant. Rates of deaths involving synthetic opioids ranged from 0. 9 to 30. 3 per 100, 000, with the largest rates and increases concentrated in eastern states. New Hampshire (30. 3 per 100, 000), West Virginia (26. 3), and Massachusetts (23. 5) had the highest synthetic opioid death rates. T wenty states and DC experienced increases in overdose death rates involving synthetic opioids, with 10 experiencing increases by 100%; the largest such increase (392. 3%) occurred in DC, followed by Illinois (227. 3%) and Maryland (206. 9%) (Table 2) . Many states with large increases in synthetic opioid death rates also had large increases in rates involving other drug categories (e. g. , Maryland, Virginia, and DC), including any opioid, prescription opioids (Table 1), heroin (Table 2), and cocaine (Table 3) . Thirteen states and DC experienced significant increases in heroin-involved death rates, whereas a significant decrease (56. 9%) occurred in New Hampshire (Table 2) . In 2016, the highest rates were in DC (17. 3 per 100, 000), West Virginia (14. 9), and Ohio (13. 5) . The rates of prescription opioidinvolved overdose deaths significantly increased in seven  Maps and figures providing significant changes in drug overdose and opioidinvolved overdose death rates by state are available on CDCs Drug Overdose website: https: //www. cdc. gov/drugoverdose/data. states and DC, with the highest rates in West Virginia (19. 7), Maryland (13. 1), Maine (12. 5), and Utah (12. 5) (Table 1) . The highest cocaine-involved overdose death rates occurred in DC (13. 5), Rhode Island (10. 7), and Ohio (10. 1), with 15 states and DC experiencing a significant increase from 2015 (Table 3) . Significant increases in overdose death rates from heroin, prescription opioids, and cocaine occurred primarily in states in the eastern part of the country. Fourteen states experienced significant increases in psychostimulant-involved overdose death rates. The highest rates were in midwestern and western states: Nevada (7. 5), New Mexico (7. 1), and Oklahoma (7. 1) (Table 3) . Discussion Drug overdoses resulted in 632, 331 deaths from 1999 to 2016 in the United States, with 351, 630 being opioid over - dose deaths. **** The epidemic has continued to worsen, with deaths increasing from 2015 to 2016 across all drug categories examined. Opioid-involved overdoses accounted for two thirds of drug overdose deaths, with increases across age and racial/ethnic groups, urbanization levels, and in numerous states. The findings highlight wide state and regional variations. Some states (e. g. , New Hampshire, Ohio, and West Virginia,) experienced the highest overdose death rates across multiple drug categories, and others (primarily in the Midwest and West) recorded the highest rates of psychostimulant-involved overdose deaths. In New Hampshire, although heroin-involved death rates declined from 2015 to 2016, deaths involving synthetic opioids increased, as they did in most states. In addi - tion, in some states (e. g. , Maryland, Rhode Island, and West Virginia), 2016 rates of prescription opioidinvolved deaths were higher than were those involving heroin. These data highlight the persistent and multifaceted nature of overdoses. The first wave of opioid overdose deaths began in the 1990s and included prescription opioid deaths.  A second wave, which began in 2010, was characterized by heroin deaths (5) . A third wave started in 2013, with deaths involving highly potent synthetic opioids, particularly IMF and fentanyl ana - logs (2, 3, 6) .  Synthetic opioid-involved deaths in 2016 accounted for 30. 5% of all drug overdose deaths and 45. 9% of all opioid-involved deaths, with a 100% increase in the rate of these deaths compared with 2015. Synthetic opioids propelled increases with 19, 413 deaths (more than any drug examined), and previous findings underscore the contribution of IMF. In addition, IMF is now being mixed into counterfeit **** https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db294_table. pdf.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db81. htm.  2017 National Drug Threat Assessment: https: //www. dea. gov/docs/DIR040-17_2017-NDTA. pdf; https: //emergency. cdc. gov/han/han00384. asp; https: //emergency. cdc. gov/han/han00395. asp.

Analyses were limited to states meeting the following criteria: for states with very good to excellent reporting, 90% of drug overdose deaths mention at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by no more than 10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States with good reporting had 80% to <90% of drug overdose deaths mention of at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in the percentage of drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States included also were required to have stable rate estimates, based on 20 deaths, in at least two drug categories (i. e. , opioids, prescription opioids, synthetic opioids other than methadone, heroin, cocaine, and psychostimulants with abuse potential) . South Dakota was the only state with good or excellent reporting in both years, but with an improvement >10 percentage points in drug specificity.  Absolute rate change is the difference between 2015 and 2016 rates. Percent change is the absolute rate change divided by the 2015 rate, multiplied by 100. Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2015 or 2016, and z-tests were used if the number of deaths was 100 in both 2015 and 2016. Note that the method of comparing confidence intervals is a conservative method for statistical significance; caution should be observed when interpreting a nonsignificant difference when the lower and upper limits being compared overlap only slightly. Confidence intervals of 2015 and 2016 rates of prescription opioid deaths for Asian/Pacific Islanders overlapped only slightly: (0. 37, 0. 57), (0. 56, 0. 80) . *** Statistically significant at 0. 05 level. and the percentage of drug overdose death certificates with at least one drug specified varied widely by state, ranging from 52. 5% to 99. 3% in 2016. This variation limits rate compari-sons between states. Third, because heroin and morphine are metabolized similarly (9), some heroin deaths might have been misclassified as morphine deaths, resulting in underreporting of heroin deaths. Fourth, potential race misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primar - ily for American Indian/Alaska Natives and Asian/Pacific Islanders.  Finally, state-specific analyses are restricted to 31 states and DC, limiting generalizability.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_172. pdf.

The State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System provides improved collection of toxicology data to identify specific drugs involved (6), information gathered from death scene investigations, and risk factors associated with fatal overdoses. Given the continuing threat from prescription opioids and the evolving threat from illicit opioids and other substances, a multifaceted prevention approach is required. Efforts to ensure safe prescribing practices  are enhanced by access to nonopioid and nonpharmacologic treatments for pain.

Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes X40X44, X60X64, X85, and Y10Y14. Rates are age-adjusted using the direct method and the 2000 U. S. standard population, except for age-specific crude rates. All rates are per 100, 000 population.  Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have cocaine (T40. 5) as a contributing cause.  Drug overdose deaths, as defined, that have psychostimulants with abuse potential (T43. 6) as a contributing cause.  Categories of deaths are not exclusive because deaths may involve more than one drug. Summing of categories will result in greater than the total number of deaths in a year. ** Data for Hispanic origin should be interpreted with caution; studies comparing Hispanic origin on death certificates and on census surveys have shown inconsistent reporting on Hispanic ethnicity. Potential race misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primarily AI/AN non-Hispanic and A/PI non-Hispanic decedents. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_172. pdf.  By 2013 urbanization classification. https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural. htm.  Analyses were limited to states meeting the following criteria: For states with very good to excellent reporting, 90% of drug overdose deaths mention at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States with good reporting had 80% to <90% of drug overdose deaths mention of at least one specific drug in 2015, with the change in the percentage of drug overdose deaths mentioning at least one specific drug differing by <10 percentage points from 2015 to 2016. States included also were required to have stable rate estimates, based on 20 deaths, in at least two drug categories (i. e. , opioids, prescription opioids, synthetic opioids other than methadone, heroin, cocaine, and psychostimulants with abuse potential) . South Dakota was the only state with good or excellent reporting in both years, but with an improvement >10 percentage points in drug specificity.  Absolute rate change is the difference between 2015 and 2016 rates. Percent change is the absolute rate change divided by the 2015 rate, multiplied by 100. Nonoverlapping confidence intervals based on the gamma method were used if the number of deaths was <100 in 2015 or 2016, and z-tests were used if the number of deaths was 100 in both 2015 and 2016. *** Statistically significant at 0. 05 level.  Cells with 9 deaths are not reported. Rates based on <20 deaths are not considered reliable and not reported. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 358 MMWR / M arch 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? From 1999 to 2015, the drug overdose epidemic resulted in approximately 568, 699 deaths. In 2015, 52, 404 drug overdose deaths occurred; 63. 1% (33, 091) involved an opioid. From 2014 to 2015, the age-adjusted opioid-involved death rate increased by 15. 6%; the rapid increase in deaths was driven in large part by synthetic opioids other than methadone (e. g. , fentanyl) . What is added by this report? In 2016, there were 63, 632 drug overdose deaths in the United States. Opioids accounted for 66. 4% (42, 249) of deaths, with increases across age groups, racial/ethnic groups, urbanization levels, and multiple states. Age-adjusted death rates for overdoses involving synthetic opioids other than methadone doubled from 2015 to 2016, and death rates from prescription opioids, heroin, cocaine, and psychostimulants also increased. What are the implications for public health practice? There is an urgent need to implement a multifaceted, collaborative public health and public safety approach. Building on existing resources, more rapidly available and comprehensive surveillance data are needed to track emerging drug threats to guide public action to prevent and respond to the epidemic through increased naloxone availability, harm reduction services, linkage into treatment (including medication-assisted treatment), safe prescribing practices, and supporting law enforcement strategies to reduce the illicit drug supply. 3.

Cowie, PhD2; Sarah E. Lessem, PhD3; Sharon H. Saydah, PhD1; Andy Menke, PhD4; Linda S. Geiss, MA1; T revor J. Orchard, MD5; Deborah B. Rolka, MS1; Giuseppina Imperatore, MD, PhD1 Currently 23 million U. S. adults have been diagnosed with diabetes (1) . The two most common forms of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes results from the autoim - mune destruction of the pancreass beta cells, which produce insulin. Persons with type 1 diabetes require insulin for survival; insulin may be given as a daily shot or continuously with an insulin pump (2) . Type 2 diabetes is mainly caused by a com-bination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency (3) . A small proportion of diabetes cases might be types other than type 1 or type 2, such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (3) . Although the majority of prevalent cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are in adults, national data on the prevalence of type 1 and type 2 in the U. S. adult population are sparse, in part because of the previous difficulty in classifying diabetes by type in surveys (2, 4, 5) . In 2016, supplemental questions to help distinguish diabetes type were added to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (6) . This study used NHIS data from 2016 to estimate the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among adults by primary type. Overall, based on self-reported type and current insulin use, 0. 55% of U. S. adults had diagnosed type 1 diabetes, representing 1. 3 million adults; 8. 6% had diagnosed type 2 diabetes, representing 21. 0 million adults. Of all diagnosed cases, 5. 8% were type 1 diabetes, and 90. 9% were type 2 diabetes; the remaining 3. 3% of cases were other types of diabetes. Understanding the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes by type is important for monitoring trends, planning public health responses, assessing the burden of disease for edu - cation and management programs, and prioritizing national plans for future type-specific health services. NHIS is an annual, cross-sectional household interview survey conducted by CDC that gathers health-related data in a nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitution - alized U. S. population (6) . The 2016 NHIS Sample Adult Core consisted of 33, 028 adults aged 18 years, with a final response rate of 54. 3%. Each respondent was randomly selected among all adults aged 18 years in each household. During face-to-face interviews, respondents were asked whether a doctor or health care professional had ever told them that they had diabetes, other than during pregnancy. Among those who said they had diabetes, questions were asked regarding age at diagnosis and insulin and oral hypoglycemic medication use. In 2016, respondents were also asked to report whether they had type 1, type 2, or another type of diabetes. Virtually all patients with type 1 diabetes require insulin to survive, and very few persons who use insulin do not report using it (5) . Previous studies have found that self-reported diabetes type alone is not a valid method for classifying diabetes type in surveys because some patients are not aware of their diabetes type (5, 7) . Therefore, for this analysis, type 1 diabetes was defined as current insulin use and self-report of type 1 diabetes. Adults who reported having type 1 diabetes but reported not using insulin were classified as having type 2 diabetes, as were persons who reported type 2 diabetes, unknown diabetes type, or who would not report diabetes type. Respondents who reported having another diabetes type were classified as having other type. Crude prevalence estimates of diagnosed diabetes by type and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the overall population and by selected sociodemographic charac-teristics. P values were calculated from chi-squared tests and were considered significant at <0. 05. Final survey weights were applied to the data to adjust for various probabilities of selec - tion and household nonresponse. Statistical software was used to account for NHISs complex sampling design. A total of 3, 519 respondents aged 18 years reported hav - ing diabetes, including 211 classified as having type 1; 3, 210 classified as having type 2 (including 182 who reported having type 1, but not taking insulin; 2, 897 who reported having type 2; one who reported an unknown type; and one refusal); and 98 classified as having other type. In 2016, the overall crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among U. S. adults was 9. 44% (95% CI = 9. 019. 88) . The prevalences of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and other diabetes types were 0. 55%, 8. 58%, and 0. 31%, respectively (Table) . The weighted percent - ages of all diagnosed diabetes cases that were type 1 and type 2 were 5. 8% and 90. 9%, respectively; the remaining were other types. Based on the weighted NHIS population, the estimated numbers of adults with type 1, type 2, and other diabetes types were 1. 3 million, 21. 0 million, and 0. 8 million, respectively. Estimated crude prevalence of type 1 diabetes among U. S. adults did not significantly vary by age group (p = 0. 54) or education (p = 0. 14) (Table) . The prevalence of type 1 dia - betes was higher among men (0. 64%) than among women Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 360 MMWR / M arch 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (0. 46%) (p<0. 05) and higher among non-Hispanic whites (whites) (0. 67%) than among Hispanics (0. 22%) (p<0. 01) . By age group, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was highest among adults aged 65 years and lowest among adults aged 1829 years (p<0. 001), and by race/ethnicity, was higher among non-Hispanic blacks (11. 52%) than among non-His - panic Asians (6. 89%), whites (7. 99%), and Hispanics (9. 07%) (p<0. 001) (Table) . The prevalence of type 2 diabetes decreased with higher levels of educational attainment (p<0. 001) . Discussion In 2016, the estimated prevalences of diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes were 0. 55% (corresponding to 1. 3 million U. S. adults) and 8. 6% (corresponding to 21. 0 million U. S. adults), respectively. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes accounted for approximately 6% and 91% of all cases of diagnosed diabetes, respectively. Because the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is so much higher than that of type 1, current diabetes surveillance data that do not distinguish diabetes type are more reflective of persons with type 2 diabetes. Recent analysis of diagnosed diabetes prevalence indicates a plateauing among adults aged 2079 years (8), but it is not known whether this trend might Summary What is already known about this topic? The two most common forms of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. Previous national diabetes prevalence estimates did not distinguish between types among U. S. adults. What is added by this report? New data allowed estimation of diagnosed diabetes by type. In 2016, the prevalence of diagnosed type 1 diabetes was 0. 55%, representing 1. 3 million U. S. adults; the prevalence of diag-nosed type 2 diabetes was 8. 6%, representing 21. 0 million U. S. adults. Non-Hispanic white adults had a higher prevalence of diagnosed type 1 diabetes than did Hispanic adults. Non-Hispanic blacks had the highest prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Diagnosed type 2 diabetes prevalence estimates increased with age and decreased with increasing levels of educational attainment. What are the implications for public health practice? Knowledge about national prevalence of diagnosed diabetes by type might be helpful in monitoring trends, assessing the burden of disease for education and management programs, and guiding and prioritizing national plans for future type-specific health services. differ for type 1 diabetes. Because the etiology, treatment, and outcomes of diabetes vary by type, it is important to distinguish between them. There is no reference standard for classifying prevalent type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes cases in public health surveillance. The presence of autoantibodies against the beta cells of the pan - creas and the lack of endogenous insulin secretion are biologic markers of type 1 diabetes. However, beta cell autoantibodies disappear with time and might even be absent at the time of type 1 diabetes diagnosis (2) . Insulin secretion tests are difficult to perform and interpret, making these tests unsuitable for use in cross-sectional surveys. In administrative health databases and electronic medical records, adults with diabetes frequently have International Classification of Diseases codes for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. For this reason, disease coding has been combined with other information (e. g. , current prescriptions for insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication) when estimat - ing diabetes type in these data (9, 10) . Using type 1 diabetes self-report and current insulin use to classify diabetes type, the percentage of all diabetes cases that were type 1 diabetes fell reasonably within the range of results from other studies (approximately 5%10%) (35, 9) . The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, the data were self-reported and underestimate the total number of adults with diabetes. Second, data were not validated, which could have led to misclassification of diabetes type. Adults with self-reported type 1 diabetes who did not report insulin use were reclassified as having type 2 diabetes, TABLE.

However, self-reported use of insulin is highly specific: <0. 02% of persons who reported insulin in a medication log failed to report using it when asked (5) . Some insulin users with type 2 diabetes might have incorrectly reported type 1 diabetes, assuming that tak - ing insulin meant they had type 1 diabetes (5) . In addition, because self-reported cases of unknown type were reclassified as type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes might have been overestimated. However, according to a Canadian survey-based algorithm to distinguish diabetes types, 99% of adults who self-reported unknown type would have been classified as type 2 diabetes (7) . Finally, the small sample size of some subgroups limited precision. Despite these limitations, this first study to estimate the prevalence of diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes based on self-report and current insulin use among U. S. adults provides information to track prevalence of diabetes by type to moni - tor trends and assess the burden of disease for education and prevention programs. Knowledge about national prevalences of type 1 and type 2 diabetes might facilitate assessment of the long-term cost-effectiveness of public health interventions and policies aimed at improving diabetes management and help to prioritize national plans for future type-specific health services.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening but preventable complication of diabetes characterized by uncontrolled hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL), metabolic aci - dosis, and increased ketone concentration that occurs most frequently in persons with type 1 diabetes (2) . CDCs United States Diabetes Surveillance System* (USDSS) indicated an increase in hospitalization rates for DKA during 20092014, most notably in persons aged <45 years. To explore this finding, 20002014 data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualitys National Inpatient Sample (NIS)  were assembled to calculate trends in DKA hospitalization rates and in-hospital case-fatality rates. Overall, age-adjusted DKA hospitalization rates decreased slightly from 2000 to 2009, then reversed direction, steadily increasing from 2009 to 2014 at an average annual rate of 6. 3%. In-hospital case-fatality rates declined consistently during the study period from 1. 1% to 0. 4%. Better understanding the causes of this increasing trend in DKA hospitalizations and decreasing trend in in-hospital case-fatality through further exploration using multiple data sources will facilitate the targeting of prevention efforts. NIS is a nationally representative sample of hospital discharges, corresponding to >35 million hospitalizations annually. Discharges with a first-listed, primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 250. 1 (diabetes with ketoacidosis) were considered DKA hospitalizations (1, 3) . To calculate DKA hospitalization rates among persons with diabetes, the civilian, noninstitutionalized population with diabetes was estimated using corresponding years of data from CDCs National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) .  Because diabetes type was not collected in NHIS, rates were not stratified by disease type. In-hospital case-fatality rate was defined as the proportion of persons hospitalized for DKA who died in the hospital. DKA rates were age-adjusted using four age groups (<45, 4564, 6574, and 75 years) from the 2000 U. S. Census. Joinpoint regression models,  which use permutation tests * https: //www. cdc. gov/diabetes/data.  https: //www. hcup-us. ahrq. gov/nisoverview. jsp.  https: //www. cdc. gov/nchs/nhis/methods. htm.  https: //surveillance. cancer. gov/joinpoint. to identify points where linear trends change significantly in direction or magnitude, were used to analyze trends in DKA hospitalization and case-fatality rates, stratified by age group and sex, allowing for a maximum of two joinpoints. In the final model, each trend segment was described by an annual percent change, and the trend for each period was tested to determine whether the slope was significantly different from zero. A p-value of <0. 05 was considered statistically significant. The analysis accounted for the complex sampling designs of NIS and NHIS. From 2000 to 2009, the age-adjusted rate of DKA hospitalizations among persons with diabetes fluctuated but declined at an average annual rate of 1. 1% (Figure) (Table 1) . During 20092014, however, the rate increased 54. 9%, from 19. 5 to 30. 2 per 1, 000 persons, at an average annual rate of 6. 3%. The reversal in trend was apparent across all age groups and both sexes. Rates were highest in persons aged <45 years (44. 3 per 1, 000 in 2014) and lowest in persons aged 65 years (<2. 0 per 1, 000) (Table 1) . In-hospital case-fatality rates declined during 20002014 at an annual average rate of 6. 8% (from 1. 1% to 0. 4% [63. 6% decline overall]); no joinpoints were found (Figure) (Table 2) . The declining rates were seen across all age groups and both sexes. Although the highest case-fatality rates were observed among persons aged 75 years, this group experienced the largest absolute decrease across the entire period. Discussion Although DKA hospitalization rates among persons with diabetes declined slightly from 2000 to 2009, this trend reversed, with rates increasing 54. 9% from 2009 to 2014. From 2009 to 2014 all age groups experienced an increase of 6. 0% annually in DKA hospitalization rates, with highest rates among persons aged <45 years. This increase in DKA hospitalization rates is concerning because DKA is a life-threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes. Despite the increase in DKA hospitalization rates, however, in-hospital mortality among persons with DKA consistently decreased over the study period. Identification of factors contributing to the increase in hospitalizations for DKA might help target prevention efforts. Although DKA is more common among persons with type 1 diabetes, it also occurs among persons with type 2 diabetes (2) .

DKA can be the initial sign of unrecognized type 1 or type 2 diabetes; however, it occurs more frequently in persons with established disease (4) . T wo studies among youths found either stable or decreasing rates of DKA at the time of diagnosis of diabetes, suggesting that younger persons with established disease and poor glucose control might be the group con - tributing most to the increase in DKA hospitalization rates among persons aged <45 years (5, 6) . However, whether DKA is occurring at the time of diagnosis or among persons with established disease in adults is unknown. The causes of the increase in DKA hospitalization rates are not clear, but several possible explanations include the following: changes in case definition, new medications that might increase the risk for DKA, and higher admission rates because of lower thresholds for hospitalization (i. e. , admission of persons with less serious disease) . Although the American Diabetes Association definition of DKA has not changed over the years, the most recent 2009 publication described a euglycemic DKA type characterized by metabolic acidosis and increased total body ketone concentration, but with glucose levels 250 mg/dL, occurring in approximately 10% of patients with DKA (7) . Euglycemic DKA hospitalizations might have resulted in an increase in the number of hospitalized patients classified as having DKA, but NIS does not have laboratory data to corroborate this hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes that DKA case definitions are uniformly applied in clinical practice, which in a call for standardization of diagnostic criteria for DKA was demonstrated to be unlikely (8) . Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a class of prescription medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, were approved in March 2013. In December 2015, the Food and Drug Administration added a label to SGLT2 inhibitors warning that these medications might increase the risk for DKA. Because SGLT2 inhibitors were only recently approved, and DKA rates increased before their introduction, they are likely not a major contributor to the increasing DKA trend but do remain an ongoing concern for future events. More recent higher admission rates for less severe cases of DKA could also explain an increased trend in DKA admissions. Although no evidence that this occurred exists, analyzing emergency depart - ment data might help confirm or refute this hypothesis. The causes of the decrease in DKA in-hospital mortality are also not clear. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of DKA and adoption of DKA treatment guidelines, both of which might have led to better management and treatment, have been proposed as reasons for declines in DKA in-hospital mortality (2) . Another possibility is that hospital admission of less severe cases has resulted in higher admission rates and con - tributed to the lower in-hospital case-fatality rates over time. In the early 2000s, an increase in DKA cases among per - sons with obesity and type 2 diabetes was reported (9) . These patients had impaired insulin levels but lacked typical autoim - mune markers of type 1 disease, and their beta-cell function recovered quickly after treatment. This disease type, named ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, has features of both type 1 and type 2 disease. Other variants of diabetes have been described, but no evidence that rates of these disease variants are increasing and thus contributing to the increased DKA hospitalization rates could be found (10) . In 2014, the DKA hospitalization rate among persons with diabetes aged <45 years was approximately 27 times the rate among persons aged 65 years. Therefore, efforts to understand factors contributing to the increase in hospitalizations for DKA should consider the demographic and clinical characteristics Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / March 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 365 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionof youths and young adults. Information from studies among these groups might help determine whether factors such as symptom recognition, adherence to therapy, self-management skills, access to care, or cost of treatment should be a focus of DKA prevention strategies. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi - tations. First, NIS does not include federal hospitals, which would lead to an underestimate of the total number of DKA hospitalizations; however, NIS represents approximately 96% of the U. S. population. Second, although in-hospital DKA case-fatality rates declined, mortality rates at home or in the emergency department setting were not investigated. Third, the DKA case definition used in this analysis was based on an ICD-9-CM code from the hospital discharge record that could not be validated. Misclassification might have occurred leading to overor underestimation of hospitalization rates. However, misclassification caused by changing coding practices over time is unlikely. Finally, results were not stratified by diabetes type, and persons with type 1 diabetes are at particularly high risk for DKA. DKA hospitalizations in the United States have increased among all age groups, with the highest rates among persons aged <45 years. Although the continued decline in in-hospital DKA mortality is encouraging, further work might help iden-tify populations at risk. Evidence-based, targeted prevention measures, such as diabetes self-management education and support might help reverse the trend in this potentially life-threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes, a disease that affects approximately 30 million persons in the United States. DKA is more common among persons with type 1 diabetes. What is added by this report? After a slight decline during 20002009, hospitalizations for DKA increased in the United States during 20092014 among all age groups and were highest among persons aged <45 years. Concurrently, in-hospital case-fatality rates among persons with DKA consistently decreased from 2000 to 2014. What are the implications for public health practice? DKA is a life-threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes. Prevention measures, such as diabetes self-management education, might help reverse the increasing trend in DKA, especially in persons aged <45 years who have the highest DKA rates. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 366 MMWR / M arch 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTwo Cases of Meningococcal Disease in One Family Separated by an Extended Period  Colorado, 20152016 Emily Spence Davizon, MPH1; Heidi M. Soeters, PhD2; Lisa Miller, MD1; Meghan Barnes, MSPH1 On April 26, 2015, a case of meningococcal disease in a woman aged 75 years was reported to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) . As part of routine public health investigation and control activities, all seven family contacts of the patient were advised to receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci and prevent secondary disease (1), although it is not known whether the family contacts complied with PEP recommendations. Fifteen months later, on June 6, 2016, CDPHE was notified that the grandchild of the first patient, a male infant aged 3 months who lived with the first patient, also had meningococcal dis - ease. The infants immediate family members (parents and one sibling) were among family contacts for whom PEP was recommended in 2015. Neisseria meningitidis isolates from both patients were found to be serogroup C at the CDPHE laboratory. Whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis at CDC found that both isolates had the same sequence type, indicat - ing close genetic relatedness. These cases represent a possible instance of meningococcal disease transmission within a family, despite appropriate PEP recommendations and with a long interval between cases. Investigation and Results On April 24, 2015, the first patient was evaluated at hospital A for aphasia, rigors, chills, and fever. She was hospi - talized and treated empirically with ceftriaxone and azithro-mycin. Blood specimens collected before antibiotic initiation were culture-positive for N. meningitidis; Gram stain of the patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), collected after initiation of antibiotics, revealed gram-negative diplococci, characteristic of Neisseria species; however, bacterial cultures showed no growth after 7 days. CDPHE was notified of the case on April 26, 2015. Once N. meningitidis was identified, the patient received 10 days of ceftriaxone therapy. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility after 7 days and recovered. The blood isolate was determined to be serogroup C via slide agglutination and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) testing at the CDPHE laboratory. Fifteen months later, on June 4, 2016, the grandson of the first patient, aged 3 months, was evaluated in the emergency department of hospital B for fever and decreased alertness. A blood specimen was obtained, empirical ceftriaxone was administered, and the patient was airlifted to hospital C, where petechiae were noted, and a lumbar puncture was performed. Gram stain of the patients blood revealed gram-negative dip - lococci, and blood culture was positive for N. meningitidis. No organisms were detected in the infants CSF. An assessment of the infant for complement component deficiency, which can increase risk for meningococcal disease (2), did not reveal any abnormalities. CDPHE was notified of the case on June 6, 2016. The infant recovered after 7 days of treatment with ampicillin. CDPHE laboratory determined the blood isolate from the infant was also serogroup C N. meningitidis via slide agglutination and real-time PCR. Following the identification of the second patient, isolates from both the grandmother and the grandchild were submit-ted for WGS analysis at CDC. The two isolates had the same sequence type (sequence type 2006, clonal complex 103) and were more closely related to each other than to other isolates from sporadic cases within the same clonal complex. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated both isolates were pansusceptible. Public Health Response In 2015, after the report of the first case, a public health investigation was conducted by Jefferson County Public Health and CDPHE. Seven family contacts of the patient were identi - fied and advised to receive PEP, consisting of oral ciprofloxacin for the six adult contacts and intramuscular ceftriaxone for one child contact. In 2016, during the public health investigation of the second case, it was learned that the grandmother lived with her grand - son and was his child care provider. Oral ciprofloxacin PEP was recommended for five adult contacts and oral rifampin for one child contact (five household contacts and one com - munity contact) . All five household contacts had previously been advised to receive PEP following the first patients illness in 2015. Discussion Meningococcal disease is a rare and serious illness; an aver - age of 10 cases per year were reported in Colorado during 20112016. N. meningitidis is transmitted through direct contact with large-droplet respiratory tract secretions from Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / March 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 367 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionpersons with meningococcal disease or asymptomatic naso - pharyngeal carriage (2) . Although the first patient lived with and cared for the second patient during the day, she was appropriately treated for menin - gococcal disease, and her family contacts, including the parents and sibling of the second patient, were appropriately advised to receive PEP; however, compliance with PEP recommenda - tions was not known. These cases represent a possible instance of meningococcal disease transmission within a family, despite appropriate PEP recommendations and with an interval of 15 months between cases, with the second case occurring in an infant who was not yet born at the time the first case occurred. There have been some documented examples of household trans - mission of meningococcal disease (37); a review estimated the attack rate among household contacts who received appropriate PEP to be 1. 1 cases per 1, 000 household contacts (4) . The mechanism behind this instance of household trans - mission is unclear. An unidentified close contact of the grandmother could have been a close contact of the infant patient, or this strain of N. meningitidis could have been circulating asymptomatically in the wider community for an extended period. A third possibility is that PEP failed to eradi - cate carriage within the family, either because of incomplete compliance, nonsimultaneous administration, or incomplete eradication of carriage. Although estimates vary, 5%10% of adults are colonized with N. meningitidis at any given time, and most colonized persons carry nonpathogenic strains and do not develop disease (1) . Both disease treatment and PEP would be expected to eradicate meningococcal carriage (1, 8) . Although PEP was recommended and prescribed for all identi - fied close contacts of the first patient, because compliance was not ascertained, it is not known whether all contacts received PEP. Because N. meningitidis can only survive on surfaces for 10 days (9), it is unlikely that environmental persistence of the bacteria contributed to transmission. Household links between cases are not routinely documented as part of national meningococcal disease surveillance, and the frequency with which household transmission of meningococ - cal disease occurs in the United States is not easily known. The 15-month interval between these two cases is longer than in previous reports of household transmission (range = <1 day to 39 weeks) (37) . However, some of these studies (6, 7) limited their definition of secondary cases to a specific window of time after the first case, limiting these comparisons. WGS analysis confirmed the same sequence type in both cases, whereas older reports of multiple cases of meningococcal disease within households could determine that isolates were of the same sero - group but lacked the ability to determine the sequence type. Summary What is already known about this topic? Meningococcal disease is a rare and serious illness; an average of 10 cases per year were reported in Colorado during 20112016. Both disease treatment and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease are expected to eradicate meningococcal carriage. What is added by this report? This report describes a possible instance of meningococcal disease transmission within a family, despite appropriate PEP recommendations (but without documentation of compliance), with a 15-month interval between cases and with the second case in an infant who was not yet born at the time the first case occurred. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm the same sequence type in both cases, whereas older reports of multiple cases of meningococcal disease within households were often limited to the same serogroup, without ability to confirm the exact strain. What are the implications for public health practice? Vaccination of close contacts of sporadic meningococcal disease cases in addition to PEP is not currently recommended in the United States for the prevention of secondary cases. Additional evaluations to estimate the secondary attack rate within households and efforts to improve documentation of PEP compliance would be helpful to assess existing recommen-dations for public health response to meningococcal disease cases in the current U. S. epidemiologic context.

Head, PhD13; Keun Lee, MPH1; Nelson Arboleda, MD14; Douglas H. Esposito, MD1 Since 2013, CDC has received reports and investigated seri - ous complications among medical tourists (i. e. , persons whose primary purpose for international travel is medical care) upon their return to the United States (1) . On May 1, 2017, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene informed CDC of three patients with nontuberculous myco - bacteria (NTM) surgical site infections (SSI), all of whom had undergone cosmetic surgical procedures by a single surgeon at Centro Internacional de Ciruga Plstica Avanzada (CIPLA) in the Dominican Republic (2) . To identify additional patients, calls for cases were issued via CDCs Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X), state-based health alert systems, the Infectious Diseases Society of Americas Emerging Infections Network, and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons email distribution list. State and Notes from the Field local health department staff members interviewed reported patients to collect information about medical care received abroad, symptoms, and treatment received after their original surgical procedures. A confirmed case of cosmetic surgeryassociated NTM infection was defined as a diagnosed SSI and laboratory evidence confirming the presence of NTM in a U. S. resident who underwent a cosmetic surgery procedure in the Dominican Republic since January 1, 2017. As of November 8, 2017, CDC had been notified of 52 patients from nine states with an SSI after cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic; 38 (73%) met the confirmed case definition. The remaining 14 did not have laboratory evidence of NTM and thus did not meet the confirmed case definition. All confirmed cases occurred in women who reported undergo - ing surgery during January 4July 14, 2017 (Figure) . Patients meeting the confirmed case definition identified 14 surgeons at seven surgical centers in the Dominican Republic (clinics A, B, C, D, E, CIPLA, and one unknown clinic) . Among confirmed cases with available information, 26 (81%) of 32 patients reported undergoing surgery at CIPLA; 11 of 11 with information on treatment received more than one anti - biotic, and 14 of 15 required therapeutic surgical procedures after returning to the United States. One death was reported. FIGURE. Nontuberculous mycobacteria infections (N = 37) associated with cosmetic surgery among U.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 370 MMWR / M arch 30, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 12 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center conducted whole genome sequencing of isolates from 22 cases and identified three distinct genetic cluster variants. None of the clusters corresponded to a single clinic or a single surgeon. NTM are ubiquitous in nature and commonly colo - nize water systems as a mix of clonal variants, which can make speciation less relevant in the context of an outbreak. CDC notified public health authorities in the Dominican Republic of the investigation and issued a travel notice on July 18, 2017, advising U. S. residents of the risks associated with any surgery at CIPLA (2) . CIPLA was temporarily closed on July 8, 2017. Detection of outbreaks among medical tourists relies on clinical recognition and reporting to public health authori - ties. Patients who attend a single clinic abroad might be sparsely distributed across the United States. Furthermore, extrapulmonary NTM infections are not nationally notifi - able and require targeted diagnostic testing, making cluster identification more difficult (3) . This investigation, in the context of medical tourisms rap - idly growing market, underscores the need for education of prospective medical tourists about possible risks and highlights the importance of health care providers having a high index of suspicion for NTM early in the evaluation of patients with SSI after cosmetic surgery (4) . CDC continues to seek reports of infections after medical tourism from health departments. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists recently approved a standard case definition to support improved sur-veillance for extrapulmonary NTM infections (3) .

Sakthivel, PhD3; Julu Bhatnagar, PhD4; Demi B. Rabeneck, MS4; Sherif Zaki, MD, PhD4; John Watson, MD3 On February 3, 2017, a local health department notified the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) of a severe respiratory illness outbreak, including two hospitalizations and one death, at a substance abuse treatment facility. During December 2016January 2017, NJDOH surveillance for noninfluenza respiratory viruses identified multiple human adenovirus (HAdV) cases in the surrounding community. HAdVs can cause severe respiratory illness, and outbreaks of HAdV type 4 (HAdV-4) and HAdV type 7 (HAdV-7) have been associated with communal living facilities, including military barracks (1) . A combined HAdV-4 and HadV-7 live oral vaccine is available but is currently limited to military use (2) . NJDOH and the local health department investigated the outbreak in consultation with CDC to describe outbreak scope and provide infection control recommendations in this communal facility. The facility has an average outpatient census of 25 persons, an average daily census of 85 inpatients, and 91 staff members. Both staff members and patients congregate in multiple com - munal areas for group therapy sessions, recreational and social activities, smoking, and eating. In this outbreak, a probable case was defined as the occurrence of an acute respiratory illness (defined as any two of the following: fever 100F [37. 8C], sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, or nasal congestion) in a patient with an epidemiologic link to the treatment facility during January 1, 2017March 31, 2017. Confirmed cases met the probable case definition and had a positive test result for HAdV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or lung tissue specimen. Seventy-nine probable cases including 59 inpatients and 20 staff mem - bers were identified. Among these 79 patients, four (5%) were hospitalized, and three died (case fatality rate 4%) . Specimens were available from 25 probable cases; four of these, all in hos - pitalized patients, were confirmed as HAdV by PCR. The three fatal cases included two patients with HAdV-7 identified from nasopharyngeal specimens and one with HAdV-7 identified from a lung tissue specimen at autopsy. HAdV detected from the fourth patient was not typed. The three persons who died initially developed fever and cough, which rapidly progressed to multifocal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure progressed and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; respira - tory failure was followed by acute renal failure and death. Among the three fatal cases, time from symptom onset to death ranged from 4 to 37 days; patients ranged in age from 54 to 64 years, and two were men. According to the patients medical histories, one had cirrhosis, one had diabetes mel - litus type 2, and one had both cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus type 2. All three deaths occurred in persons who reported a history of alcoholism. Alcohol abuse independently increases the risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome approximately threefold to fourfold (3) . The outbreak setting presented challenges in management and control of HAdV transmission because of the commu - nal living and group-therapy environment. Local, state, and federal officials recommended 1) use of U. S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved viricide cleaners on common touch areas in communal gathering places, 2) frequent patient and staff member handwashing, 3) isolation of patients with fever 100F (37. 8C) lasting 24 hours, and 4) a 72-hour deferral for new admissions during implementation of rec - ommended infection control measures. No new cases were reported after March 24, 2017. HAdV-7 is known to cause morbidity and mortality, particu - larly in military training facilities (4) . Adenovirus morbidity and mortality associated with nonmilitary congregate settings are less well described, although severe morbidity and mortality have been documented among immunocompromised patients (5) . This outbreak investigation documents severe morbidity and mortality associated with HAdV-7 among persons in a substance abuse treatment facility with specific comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, alcoholism, and cirrhosis and highlights the challenges of illness containment in a com - munal environment. Clinicians and public health practitioners should be aware of HAdV-7 as a potential cause of severe respiratory illness in these settings.
