Hlavsa, MPH2 Outbreaks associated with untreated recreational water can be caused by pathogens, toxins, or chemicals in fresh water (e. g. , lakes, rivers) or marine water (e. g. , ocean) . During 20002014, public health officials from 35 states and Guam voluntarily reported 140 untreated recreational waterassoci-ated outbreaks to CDC. These outbreaks resulted in at least 4, 958 cases of disease and two deaths. Among the 95 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology, enteric pathogens caused 80 (84%); 21 (22%) were caused by norovirus, 19 (20%) by Escherichia coli, 14 (15%) by Shigella, and 12 (13%) by Cryptosporidium. Investigations of these 95 outbreaks identified 3, 125 cases; 2, 704 (87%) were caused by enteric pathogens, including 1, 459 (47%) by norovirus, 362 (12%) by Shigella, 314 (10%) by Cryptosporidium, and 155 (5%) by E. coli. Avian schistosomes were identified as the cause in 345 (11%) of the 3, 125 cases. The two deaths were in persons affected by a single outbreak (two cases) caused by Naegleria fowleri. Public parks (50 [36%]) and beaches (45 [32%]) were the leading settings associated with the 140 outbreaks. Overall, the majority of outbreaks started during JuneAugust (113 [81%]); 65 (58%) started in July. Swimmers and parents of young swimmers can take steps to minimize the risk for exposure to pathogens, toxins, and chemicals in untreated recreational water by heed - ing posted advisories closing the beach to swimming; not swimming in discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy water; not swimming while sick with diarrhea; and limiting water entering the nose when swimming in warm freshwater.

Data on each outbreak include case count, number of deaths, etiology, setting (e. g. , park), and venue (e. g. , lake/reservoir/pond) where the exposure occurred, and earliest illness onset date. Poisson regression analysis was conducted to assess the trend in the annual counts of outbreaks. During 20002014, public health officials from 35 states and Guam voluntarily reported 140 untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks that resulted in at least 4, 958 cases** (Table) and two deaths. Etiology was confirmed for 103 (74%) outbreaks. Among these, 95 (92%) were caused by pathogens, including five outbreaks with multiple etiologies,  and resulted in at least 3, 125 cases; enteric pathogens caused 80 (84%) of the 95 outbreaks and 2, 704 (87%) of the 3, 125  20132014 are the last y ears for which finalized data were available.

The five outbreaks categorized as multiple included outbreaks of 1) Shigella and Plesiomonas shigelloides; 2) Shigella, norovirus, and Yersinia enterolytica; 3) Shigella, Campylobacter, and norovirus; 4) Shigella, Escherichia coli, and Plesiomonas shigelloides; and 5) Giardia duodenalis and norovirus. cases. Among the 95 outbreaks with a confirmed infectious etiology, 21 (22%) were caused by norovirus, 19 (20%) by E. coli, 14 (15%) by Shigella, and 12 (13%) by Cryptosporidium. Investigations of the 95 outbreaks identified 1, 459 (47%) cases caused by norovirus, 362 (12%) by Shigella, 345 (11%) by avian schistosomes, 314 (10%) by Cryptosporidium, and 155 (5%) by E. coli. The two deaths occurred within a single outbreak caused by Naegleria fowleri.  Of the 103 outbreaks with confirmed etiology, eight (8%) were caused by toxins or chemicals and resulted in at least 78 cases. Of the eight outbreaks caused by toxins or chemicals, seven (88%) were caused by algal toxins from harmful algal blooms. Public parks (50 [36%]) and beaches (45 [32%]) were the lead - ing settings associated with the 140 outbreaks. Most outbreaks were associated with a lake/reservoir/pond venue (117 [84%]) . Among the 140 outbreaks, the majority started during JuneAugust (113 [81%]), with 65 (58%) staring in July (Figure) . None of the outbreaks started during DecemberFebruary. Poisson regression analyses indicated the annual outbreak count did not change significantly over the 15 years (p = 0. 477) . Discussion A total of 140 untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks were reported to CDC during 20002014. The  Naegleria fowleri typically causes isolated cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis. For these two cases, despite an investigation by local public health authorities, the location of common exposure was not definitively identified.

The five outbreaks categorized as having multiple etiologies included outbreaks of 1) Shigella and Plesiomonas shigelloides; 2) Shigella, norovirus, and Yersinia enterolytica; 3) Shigella, Campylobacter, and norovirus; 4) Shigella, Escherichia coli, and Plesiomonas shigelloides; and 5) Giardia and norovirus.  Approximately 1, 341 cases were associated with an outbreak with predominantly skin illness caused by an etiology that was unidentified but suspected to be poison ivy when dirt was mixed with water to create an obstacle in an endurance race. ** All outbreaks without a confirmed etiology (e. g. , outbreaks with a suspected or unknown etiology) were classified as having an unidentified etiology for this analysis. Unidentified etiology indicates lack of laboratory confirmation but not necessarily absence of traditional epidemiologic and environmental health data indicative of a particular etiology. outbreaks of known infectious etiology were caused by a diverse array of chlorine-susceptible pathogens, including enteric bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Many of the pathogens that cause outbreaks in untreated recreational water venues rarely cause outbreaks in treated recreational water (e. g. , pools) (2) . Well-operated, treated recreational water venues in which water disinfectant (chlorine or bromine) concentrations are properly maintained are at decreased risk for pathogen transmission. The diversity among the etiologies of untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks also requires different sets of steps swimmers and parents of young swimmers can take to protect themselves and others from illness. The untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks were predominantly caused by enteric pathogens. Norovirus, E. coli, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, and other enteric pathogens can be transmitted via untreated recreational water when fecally contaminated water is ingested. Swimmers can be a source of fecal contamination if they have a fecal incident in the water or fecal material washes off their bodies. Other sources of fecal contamination include storm water runoff, flooding, sewage overflows, sewage treatment plant discharges, septic systems, boating waste, and animal waste on or near a beach. E. coli and Cryptosporidium contamination can be introduced by human or animal feces; norovirus and Shigella are indicative of human fecal contamination. Swimming in untreated recreational water that is shallow, poorly circulating, or overcrowded; frequented by children aged <5 years with no or limited toileting skills; without adequate, easily accessible, and well-stocked hygiene facilities (e. g. , toilets or diaper-changing stations); or swim-ming soon after heavy rain can increase risk for exposure to enteric pathogens. Other etiologies identified in this summary are unique to untreated recreational water. Avian schistosomes can cause cercarial dermatitis (swimmers itch) in persons exposed to either freshwater or brackish water in which infected birds contaminate the water and where the intermediate host snails are found. Cercarial dermatitis appears as a skin rash and is caused by an allergic reaction when cercariae in the water penetrate the skin. However, the cercariae do not mature into adult worms in humans, who are accidental hosts. Algal toxins produced by harmful algal blooms in freshwater or marine water can cause a range of illnesses, from skin or eye irritation to respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic symptoms depending on type of toxin and the route of expo - sure. In recent years, harmful algal blooms have been observed with increasing frequency and in more locations in the United States, possibly because of increasing nutrient pollution and warming water or improved surveillance (3) . In 2016, CDC launched the One Health Harmful Algal Bloom System  an electronic system that allows state and territorial public health agencies and their partners to report cases of human or animal illness or environmental data on harmful algal blooms. A better understanding of harmful algal blooms is needed to optimize prevention of associated illness and harmful algal blooms. Naegleria fowleri causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis after water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose and the ameba travels to the brain via the olfactory nerve. Infection, which is usually fatal, typically occurs when persons swim or dive in warm, untreated freshwater. The recent survival of two U. S. patients with primary amebic meningo - encephalitis suggests that early diagnosis and treatment might improve outcomes (4) . Steps can be taken by swimmers and parents of young swimmers to minimize exposure to enteric pathogens, avian schistosomes, algal toxins, and Naegleria fowleri in untreated recreational water (Box) .  https: //www. cdc. gov/habs/ohhabs. html.

Other includes all outbreaks of confirmed etiology other than Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Shigella, or norovirus. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, the outbreak counts presented likely underestimate actual disease incidence, in part because of variation in public health capacity and reporting requirements across jurisdictions. In addition, untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks might be difficult to detect given that persons who travel long distances to untreated recreational water venues might become ill after returning to geographically dispersed homes in multiple public health jurisdictions, so that the illnesses are never linked to a common exposure (5) . Entering freshwater and marine water has been associated with a wide range of illnesses despite an absence of reported outbreaks (5) . Second, for this analysis, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 705 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBOX. Preventing exposure to germs and harmful algal bloom toxins in untreated recreational water Stay out of the water if  Beach is closed or an advisory is posted for high bacterial levels or other conditions, such as sewage spills or harmful algal blooms.  A recent heavy rain has occurred.  A discharge pipe can be seen on the beach.  Fish or other animals in or near the water are dead.  Water is discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy. Diarrhea-causing germs  Dont swim or let children swim if sick with diarrhea. If diarrhea is caused by Cryptosporidium, wait until 2 weeks after diarrhea has stopped to go swimming.  Dont swallow recreational swimming water. https: //www. cdc. gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/steps-healthy-swimming. html. Avian schistosomes  Dont swim near or wade in marshy areas where snails are commonly found.  Towel dry or shower immediately after exiting the water. https: //www. cdc. gov/parasites/swimmersitch/. Harmful algal blooms  Avoid water that contains harmful algal blooms (when in doubt stay out) .  Keep children and pets from drinking discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy water.  Get out and rinse off with clean water as soon as possible after swimming in water that might contain a harmful algal bloom.  Rinse off pets, especially dogs, immediately if they swim in discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy water. Do not let them lick the algae off their fur. https: //www. cdc. gov/habs/prevention-control. html. Naegleria fowleri The only certain way to prevent a Naegleria fowleri infec - tion caused by swimming is to refrain from water-related activities in warm freshwater. To reduce exposure risk  Use nose clips, hold your nose shut, or keep head above water when taking part in water-related activities in bodies of warm freshwater.  Avoid putting your head under the water in hot springs and other untreated thermal waters.  Avoid water-related activities in warm freshwater during periods of high water temperature. https: //www. cdc. gov/parasites/naegleria/prevention. html. Summary What is already known about this topic? Untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks can be caused by pathogens, toxins, or chemicals in freshwater (e. g. , lakes) or marine water (e. g. , ocean) . What is added by this report? During 20002014, 140 untreated recreational waterassociated outbreaks that caused at least 4, 958 illnesses and two deaths were reported; 80 outbreaks were caused by enteric pathogens. What are the implications for public health practice? Swimmers should heed posted advisories closing the beach to swimming; not swim in discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy water; not swim while sick with diarrhea; and limit water entering the nose when swimming in warm freshwater. all outbreaks without a laboratory-confirmed etiology (e. g. , outbreaks with a suspected or unknown etiology) were classi - fied as having an unidentified etiology. Unidentified etiology therefore does not necessarily indicate absence of traditional epidemiologic and environmental health data indicative of a particular etiology. Finally, reporting and review procedures changed over time, which affects the ability to compare data across years. Given the connections among swimmer health, animal health, and the environment, preventing untreated recre - ational waterassociated outbreaks requires a One Health*** approach. Collaboration among those with expertise across multiple disciplines (including epidemiologists, environmental health practitioners, veterinarians, and ecologists) and multiple sectors working at the human-animal-environment interface should focus on taking steps to prevent and remediate fecal contamination of the water (e. g. , prevent sewage overflows and increase water circulation through engineering), manage wildlife (e. g. , encourage birds to leave the beach area) and other animals, properly monitor water quality for bacterial concen - tration and nutrient pollution (which promotes harmful algal blooms), and encourage a robust monitoring and notification program for untreated recreational waters (6) . Sections of the BEACH Act of 2000  allow the Environmental Protection Agency to provide grants to coastal and Great Lakes authorities to monitor their beaches and notify the public of potentially unsafe water quality conditions.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 706 MMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionand Closing Online Notification database provides a resource for swimmers to obtain information on water condi - tions. However, these are limited to coastal/marine and Great Lakes beaches, whereas most reported outbreaks are associ-ated with smaller, inland lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. This requires swimmers and parents of young swimmers to check for local beach advisories and water conditions in addition to following the steps of healthy swimming. The prevention of untreated recreational water outbreaks includes actions such as engaging and educating the public about healthy swimming, and disseminating healthy swimming messages, particularly before and during JuneAugust. These include heeding posted advisories closing the beach to swimming; not swimming in discolored, smelly, foamy, or scummy water; not swimming while sick with diarrhea; and limiting water entering the nose when swimming in warm freshwater.

Siegel, MD1, 2; Jun Li, MD, PhD2; S. Jane Henley, MSPH2; Reda J. Wilson, MPH2; Natasha Buchanan Lunsford, PhD2; Eric Tai, MD2; Elizabeth A. Van Dyne, MD1, 2 Approximately 15, 000 persons aged <20 years receive a cancer diagnosis each year in the United States (1) . National surveillance data could provide understanding of geographic variation in occurrence of new cases to guide public health planning and investigation (2, 3) . Past research on pediatric cancer incidence described differences by U. S. Census region but did not provide state-level estimates (4) . To adequately describe geographic variation in cancer incidence among persons aged <20 years in the United States, CDC analyzed data from United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) during 20032014 and identified 171, 432 cases of pediatric cancer during this period (incidence = 173. 7 cases per 1 million persons) . The cancer types with the highest incidence rates were leukemias (45. 7), brain tumors (30. 9), and lymphomas (26. 2) . By U. S. Census region, pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast (188. 0) and lowest in the South (168. 0), whereas by state (including the District of Columbia [DC]), rates were highest in New Hampshire, DC, and New Jersey. Among non-Hispanic whites (whites) and non-Hispanic blacks (blacks), pediatric cancer incidence was highest in the Northeast, and the highest rates among Hispanics were in the South. The highest rates of leukemia were in the West, and the highest rates of lymphoma and brain tumors were in the Northeast. State-based differences in pediatric cancer incidence could guide interventions related to accessing care (e. g. , in states with large distances to pediatric oncology centers), clini - cal trial enrollment, and state or regional studies designed to further explore variations in cancer incidence. USCS includes incidence data from CDCs National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program (1) . Data on new cases of cancer diagnosed during 20032014 were obtained from population-based cancer regis - tries affiliated with NPCR and SEER programs in all U. S. states and DC. This study included incidence data for all registries that met USCS publication criteria* during 20032014, which represented >99% of the U. S. population, excluding data only * Cancer registries incidence data met the following five USCS criteria: 1) 5% of cases ascertained solely on the basis of death certificate; 2) 3% of cases missing information on sex; 3) 3% of cases missing information on age; 4) 5% of cases missing information on race; and 5) 97% of registrys records passed a set of single-field and interfield computerized edits that test the validity and logic of data components. https: //nccd. cdc. gov/uscs/. from Nevada, which did not meet criteria in 2011. This report includes all cases of malignant cancer diagnosed among per - sons aged <20 years; it includes first primary cases only and excludes recurrent cases. Diagnosis histology and primary site were grouped according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC) .  Pediatric cancer rates were expressed per 1 million persons and were age-adjusted to the 2000 U. S. standard population. Rates were estimated by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, state, U. S. Census region, ** county-level economic status, county-level rural/urban classification, and ICCC group. During 20032014, CDC identified 171, 432 new cases of pediatric cancer (Table 1) . Overall incidence was 173. 7 cases per 1 million population. The cancer types with the highest incidence rates were leukemias (45. 7 per 1 million), brain tumors (30. 9), and lymphomas (26. 2) . Rates were higher in males (181. 5) than in females (165. 5) and in persons aged 04 years (228. 9) and 1519 years (213. 3) than in persons aged 59 years (122. 6) and 1014 years (133. 0) . Among all racial/ethnic groups, the highest incidence rate was among whites (184. 4), and the lowest was among blacks (133. 3) . Rates were highest in the Northeast U. S. Census region, followed by the Midwest, the West, and the South. Rates were highest in the Northeast across all age groups and among whites and blacks. Among Hispanics, rates were highest in the South. Pediatric cancer incidence rates were highest in the 25% of counties with the highest economic status and were higher in metropolitan areas with populations 1 million than in nonmetropolitan areas.

Pediatric cancer incidence rates varied by state within each cancer type (Figure) . Incidence rates were highest in the West for leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases, and myelodysplastic diseases (ICCC group I) and in the Northeast for lymphomas and reticuloendothelial neoplasms (group II) and central ner-vous system cancers (group III) . Rates were also highest in the Northeast for neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, and thyroid cancer (Supplementary Table 2, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/53586) . Renal cancer rates were highest in the Northeast and South; hepatic tumor rates were highest in the Northeast and West. Germ cell tumor rates were highest in the West (Supplementary Table 2, https: // stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/53586) . Discussion This study used recent data with greater population coverage than past studies (4, 5) to document geographic variation in pediatric cancer incidence rates by sex, age, type, and race/ethnicity. Consistent with past reports (1, 4, 5), pediatric cancer rates were highest in males, persons aged 04 years and 1519 years, whites, and the Northeast U. S. Census region. Rates were highest in metropolitan areas with populations 1 million; state-based rates were highest in New Hampshire, DC, and New Jersey.

Geographic variation in rates might account for differences in results from previous studies that were based on different populations such as state data (2, 3), SEER registries (which cover 9%28% of the U. S. population),  or other large data sets (6) . A 2016 study specific to Delaware assessed pediatric cancer incidence by demographic group and ZIP Code; the study commented on local environmental exposures and pos - sible incidence disparities based upon sex, age, race/ethnicity, geographic location, and economic status (2) . USCS data provide states with a standardized way to gauge whether local pediatric cancer incidence rates differ relative to other states and might prompt states to conduct investigations similar to the one performed in Delaware. Geographic variation in pediatric cancer incidence might be influenced by several factors. *** First, variation in childhood cancer incidence might be related to differences in exposures to carcinogenic chemicals (e. g. , air pollution, secondhand smoke, food, or drinking water) or radiation (7) . Second, genetic variation in certain populations (e. g. , prevalence of cancer predisposition genes) (2, 4, 5) might contribute to geographic differences in cancer incidence.

Past research on nationwide pediatric cancer incidence described differences by U. S. Census region but did not provide state-level estimates. What is added by this report? During 20032014, the pediatric cancer rate was highest in the Northeast, lowest in the South, and highest in metropolitan areas with populations 1 million and counties in the top 25% economic status. Incidence rates by state ranged from 145 to 206 per million and were highest in New Hampshire, the District of Columbia, and New Jersey. The highest rate of leukemia was in the West; the highest rates of lymphoma and brain cancer were in the Northeast. What are the implications for public health practice? Knowledge of these geographic differences in childhood cancer incidence can be used to enhance provider awareness, treatment capacity, survivorship care, and cancer surveillance. certain cancer types might vary by race/ethnicity. For example, Hispanic children have the highest rate of the most common type of leukemia, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and states with a higher proportion of Hispanics might have higher rates of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8) . Fourth, incidence of some types of cancer (e. g. , thyroid carcinoma) might be Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 713 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrelated to enhanced detection and access to care, which can vary by geographic location (5, 9) . In addition, geographic variation might be affected by age, economic status, or rural/urban classification (4, 8, 10) . Similar to the findings from this report, recent data detailing adult cancers also indicate that the highest cancer incidence rates are in the Northeast (10) . Rates of cancer types mostly affecting adults also varied by rural/urban status; some of these differ - ences in adults might be related to factors such as obesity or smoking (10), which might or might not also explain rural/urban variation in pediatric cancer. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, Nevada was excluded because data for 2011 did not meet quality criteria, which limits the representativeness of the findings. Second, differences in diagnosis and cancer reporting among states might contribute to variation in cancer incidence rates (8) . For example, states that were early adopters of electronic pathology reporting might report increased rates because of increased case ascertainment compared with other states. Finally, misrepresentation of race and ethnicity might exist; rate numerators might underestimate American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Hispanics, which could artificially lower rates among these groups; and U. S. Census populations used in rate denominators might undercount children and Hispanics, which could artificially increase rates in these populations (8) .  Knowledge of pediatric cancer incidence variation by state and cancer type can prompt local and state cancer registries to evaluate reporting and diagnostic standards. Understanding geographic variation in incidence rates can help cancer control planners and clinicians address obstacles in access to care, which is especially relevant to states with large distances to pediatric oncology centers (3) . Because 5-year pediatric cancer survival is >80%, and most cancer survivors require close monitoring by specialists throughout life (5), state-specific data by cancer type and patient age might help public health planners address ongoing chronic care needs. In addition, state-specific data by cancer type and patient age might help clinical trial organizers predict patient accrual. Finally, health care practitioners and researchers can use these data to guide investigations related to causes of pediatric cancer incidence variation (2, 3) . Continued surveillance will be needed to further validate findings and track geographic incidence patterns over time.  https: //www. cdc. gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/technical_notes/interpreting/race. htm.

Diepstra, MPH1; Tina Cunningham, PhD2; Anne G. Rhodes, PhD1; Lauren E. Yerkes, MPH1; Celestine A. Buyu, MPH, MHSA1 Since 2006, CDC has recommended routine, providerinitiated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening (i. e. , HIV screening at least once in lifetime) for all patients aged 1364 years in all health care settings (1) . Whereas evidence related to the frequency of HIV testing is available, less is known about the prevalence and predictors of provid - ers HIV test offers to patients (2) . National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data from Virginia were used to examine the prevalence and predictors of provider-initiated HIV test offers to heterosexual adults aged 1860 years at increased risk for HIV acquisition. In a sample of 333 persons who visited a health care provider in the 12 months before their NHBS interview, 194 (58%) reported not receiving an HIV test offer during that time, approximately one third of whom (71, 37%) also reported never having had an HIV test in their lifetime. In multivariable analysis, the prevalence of HIV test offers was significantly lower among men than among women (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0. 72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0. 530. 97) . Provider-initiated HIV test offers are an important strategy for increasing HIV testing among heterosexual populations; there is a need for increased provider-initiated HIV screening among heterosexual adults who are at risk for acquiring HIV, especially men, who were less likely than women to be offered HIV screening in this study. NHBS collects HIV prevalence and risk behavior data via anonymous HIV testing and face-to-face interviews, and Virginia conducts NHBS data collection in the Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area (Norfolk MSA) (2) . In 2016, NHBS used respondent-driven sampling to recruit heterosexual, cis-gendered adults at increased risk for acquiring HIV attributed to heterosexual activity, defined as 1) no injection drug use (IDU) or male-to-male sexual contact in the past 12 months and 2) low socioeco - nomic status* (3) . NHBS sampling methods are described in detail elsewhere (2, 3) . NHBS data in Virginia were collected during SeptemberDecember 2016. The outcome of interest, * No more than high school education or income at or below the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty income guidelines A CDC pilot study (20062007) indicated socioeconomic status as a strong predictor of HIV prevalence, leading to the incorporation of socioeconomic status into the definition of heterosexuals at increased risk for HIV acquisition for NHBS data collection and analysis purposes. https: //www. researchgate. net/ publication/232226764. an HIV test offer, was defined as a provider-initiated HIV test offer in the 12 months preceding the NHBS interview. Descriptive statistics of the analytic sample were conducted. Univariable log-binomial regression models were used to exam - ine the association between HIV test offer and demographic (gender, age, race/ethnicity, current relationship status, and health insurance coverage) and behavioral characteristics (high-risk sexual activity,  noninjection drug use in the 12 months preceding the interview, and binge drinking [4 and 5 drinks in about 2 hours for women and men, respectively] in the past 30 days) . All analysis variables, including HIV test offer, were self-reported. Variables associated with HIV test offer with a p-value <0. 25 in univariable regression analyses were included in the multivariable, log-binomial regression model. In addi - tion, aPRs for variables significant in the first multivariable regression model were recalculated with potential confound - ers selected a priori; significance in multivariable models was considered p<0. 05. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% CIs are reported (4) . Face-to-face NHBS interviews were completed with 548 persons aged 1860 years living in the Norfolk MSA (Figure) . After excluding 215 (39%) respondents, including 74 who did not meet the high-risk heterosexual definition of low socio - economic status and no recent IDU or male-to-male sexual contact, six who self-reported an HIV-positive status, 81 who had not visited a health care provider in the past 12 months, 49 who reported an HIV test >12 months before the interview with no recent high-risk sexual activity or STD diagnoses  that might warrant retesting, and five who responded Dont Know to the HIV test offer question, a final analytic sample of 333 remained. Overall, 139 (42%) persons reported receiving an HIV test offer from a health care provider. Among 194 (58%) persons who reported not receiving an HIV test offer, 156 (80%)  High-risk sexual activity was defined as any one of the following in the 12 months before the NHBS interview: any exchange sex, more than one sex partner, sex with a partner who probably or definitely had other sex partners concurrently, sex with a partner who has probably or definitely injected drugs, sex with a partner who has probably or definitely had male-to-male sexual contact, or sex with a partner who is HIV-positive. The high-risk sexual activity variable reflects the 2006 CDC recommendation for repeat HIV screening of all persons likely to be at high risk for HIV.

CDC recommends routine, provider-initiated HIV screening (i. e. , HIV screening at least once in lifetime) for all patients aged 1364 years in all health care settings. What is added by this report? In a sample of 333 health careseeking, heterosexual adults at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection, 194 (58%) reported not receiving an HIV test offer at a recent medical visit (s), and men (versus women) had a significantly lower prevalence of provider-initiated HIV test offers (32% versus 48%) . Recent HIV testing was higher among recipients of provider-initiated offers compared with nonrecipients (71% versus 16%) . What are the implications for public health practice? Provider-initiated HIV test offers are an important strategy for increasing HIV testing among heterosexual populations. More provider-initiated HIV screening among heterosexual adults at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection, especially men, is needed. insurance, and noninjection drug use, only the relationship between gender and HIV test offer was significant (aPR = 0. 72; 95% CI = 0. 530. 97) . Furthermore, when this relationship was adjusted for potential confounders selected a priori (age, race/ethnicity, current relationship status, health insurance coverage, high-risk sexual activity, noninjection drug use, and binge drinking), men continued to have a significantly lower prevalence of HIV test offers than did women (aPR = 0. 69; 95% CI = 0. 510. 93) . Discussion Since 2006, CDC has recommended routine HIV screening for all persons aged 1364 years (1), and from 2006 to 2009, the percentage of adults reporting ever receiving an HIV test Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 716 MMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionincreased from 40% to 45% (5) . More recently, NHBS data indicate that among heterosexual adults at increased risk for HIV, the percentage who have ever been tested for HIV has increased (2, 6, 7) . Nevertheless, an estimated 15% of HIV infections are undiagnosed, and missed opportunities for HIV testing remain (7) . Provider-initiated offers for HIV testing are necessary to increase HIV testing and diagnosis of infection. In the current study, HIV testing during the 12 months preced - ing an NHBS interview was over three times higher among persons who received a provider-initiated HIV test offer than among those who did not. However, approximately half of heterosexuals at increased risk for HIV infection who sought health care in the 12 months before the interview were not offered an HIV test, and men were significantly less likely to receive a test offer than were women. For this analysis, persons who reported that their most recent HIV test was >12 months before their interview and who had not experienced recent sexual risk or STD diagnoses were excluded from analysis to focus on heterosexual adults eligible for a provider-initiated HIV test offer. Among this high-risk group, nearly 60% were not offered an HIV test, and among those not offered screening, approximately one third had never received an HIV test in their lifetime. Sexual risk prevalence was high among those who did not report receiving an HIV test offer; thus, increased provider-initiated HIV screening, combined with discussion of preexposure prophylaxis and other HIV prevention strategies as appropriate, is needed (8) . Previous studies have reported that HIV testing prevalence is higher among women than among men (7, 9) . Similarly, this study found that the prevalence of HIV test offers was higher among female than among male heterosexuals. An ancillary analysis indicated that one quarter of women who received both an HIV test offer and HIV test in the past 12 months had recent testing at a family planning or obstetrics clinic, suggesting the higher prevalence of HIV test offers among women might be related to their participation in family plan - ning services. Nevertheless, previous NHBS data suggest that heterosexual men report more sex partners than do women (2, 6) . In addition, men are less likely to seek health care and routine health screens than are women, making HIV screening among men who do seek care essential (10) . TABLE 2.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 717 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAn important feature of the 2006 CDC guidance was the removal of the recommendation to conduct risk-based HIV screening to reduce barriers to and stigma around HIV screening (1) . In light of this removal, it was not unexpected that in this analysis, high-risk sexual activity did not significantly predict HIV test offer, reflecting that risk behavior discussion and HIV screening need not be integrated. Nevertheless, repeat screening is recommended among persons considered to be at high risk for acquiring HIV. Although HIV screening and risk assess - ments need not coincide, exchange of sexual health informa - tion between providers and patients is necessary for identifying heterosexual persons in need of repeat screening for HIV. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, the data are cross-sectional, and causality should not be inferred from the results. Second, the data are self-reported during a face-to-face interview and subject to social desir - ability bias, though it is unlikely this would differ by HIV test offer status. Finally, the sample is composed of persons of low socioeconomic status living in the Eastern region of Virginia, with the majority identifying as black or African American; the results might not be generalizable to other sociodemographic groups. Future work should examine racial/ethnic, regional, and socioeconomic disparities in HIV test offers. Provider-initiated HIV test offers are an important strategy for increasing HIV testing among heterosexual populations; there is a need for increased provider-initiated HIV screening among heterosexual adults at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection, especially men, who were less likely than were women to be offered HIV screening.

Nakashima, MD3; Sridhar V. Basavaraju, MD4 During August 2017, two separate clusters of platelet trans - fusionassociated bacterial sepsis were reported in Utah and California. In Utah, two patients died after platelet transfusions from the same donation. Clostridium perfringens isolates from one patients blood, the other patients platelet bag, and donor skin swabs were highly related by whole genome sequencing (WGS) . In California, one patient died after platelet transfu - sion; Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from the patients blood and platelet bag residuals and a nontransfused platelet unit were matched using WGS. Investigation revealed no devia - tions in blood supplier or hospital procedures. Findings in this report highlight that even when following current procedures, the risk for transfusion-related infection and fatality persists, making additional interventions necessary. Clinicians need to be vigilant in monitoring for platelet-transmitted bacterial infections and report adverse reactions to blood suppliers and hemovigilance systems. Blood suppliers and hospitals could consider additional evidence-based bacterial contamination risk mitigation strategies, including pathogen inactivation, rapid detection devices, and modified screening of bacterial culture protocols Investigation and Results Utah cluster. In August 2017, two apheresis platelet units and one unit of plasma were manufactured from an apheresis blood donation in Utah. Both platelet units were distributed to hospital X (Figure), where a male (patient A) with acute myeloid leukemia and neutropenia received one of the platelet units. Thirty minutes after transfusion, he developed rigors; trans - fusion-transmitted bacterial infection was not considered then because of the patients complex medical history. The patient died 4 days later. Anaerobic blood cultures, obtained shortly after transfusion, grew C. perfringens 5 days after collection. Fourteen hours after patient As transfusion, a female (patient B) with acute myeloid leukemia received the other platelet unit while on broad-spectrum antibiotics for neutro - penia at hospital X. No immediate symptoms of sepsis fol - lowed transfusion. Later that day, routine laboratory testing revealed new intravascular hemolysis. T ransfusion-transmitted bacterial infection was suspected, and Gram stain of platelet bag residuals was performed, revealing gram-positive bacilli; the platelet supplier was immediately notified. Patient B died 11 hours after transfusion. C. perfringens was isolated from an anaerobic culture of the residual platelets. Posttransfusion blood cultures from patient B were negative. Platelet units transfused to patients A and B had been col - lected 4 days before transfusion (Figure) . Routine inoculation for aerobic culture, performed 24 hours after donation, was negative for bacterial growth through 5 days. The donor had previously donated platelets and whole blood with no recipient adverse reactions reported. The health department interviewed the donor, who reported no relevant infectious exposures or symptoms. The donor consented to skin swabs, collected from the axillae, antecubital fossae, and anus. Consent for environmental sampling was not provided by the donor. As part of the investigation, multiple samples from the donor, recipients, and platelet bags were cultured for C. perfringens under anaerobic conditions. DNA was isolated from cultures that had growth (donor axillae and both antecubital fossae swabs, patient As blood, two isolates of patient Bs platelet bag residual, and one control [an unrelated C. perfringens isolate]) . WGS indicated all six epidemiologically linked isolates were highly related, with an average pairwise nucleotide difference of 3. 35e-10 compared with an average pairwise nucleotide differ - ence of 0. 02 to the unrelated control isolate (1) (Supplementary Figure 1, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/56097) . An investigation of the blood supplier and hospital X revealed no procedural deviations. The nontransfused plasma unit from the donor was quarantined. The donor was permanently deferred. California Cluster. In August 2017, three apheresis plate - let units and one unit of plasma were manufactured from an apheresis blood donation in California. One platelet unit was distributed to hospital Y, where it was divided into two aliquots, and two platelet units were distributed to hospital Z. At hospital Y, one aliquot was transfused to a male who had received an autologous stem cell transplant (patient C); he developed vomiting, tachycardia, and hypotension approxi-mately 15 minutes after transfusion initiation (Figure) . Despite discontinuing transfusion, he died within 5 hours. Multiple posttransfusion blood cultures drawn after the transfusion reaction grew K. pneumoniae. T ransfusion-transmitted bacte-rial infection was suspected, and Gram stain of platelet bag residuals was performed, revealing gram-negative rods.

K. pneumoniae was isolated from the platelet bag residuals. Five hours before patient Cs transfusion, hospital Ys second platelet aliquot had been transfused to a male (patient D) with myelodysplastic syndrome, fever, and neutropenia, who was on multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics. Approximately 9 hours after transfusion, the patient developed septic shock but recovered. Multiple posttransfusion blood cultures were negative, presumably a result of the antibiotic regimen. When the blood supplier notified hospital Z of gramnegative rods identified in the residual aliquot transfused into patient C, the hospital returned a nontransfused platelet unit from which K. pneumoniae was later isolated. Hospital Zs other platelet unit had been transfused 1 day before the notification. This platelet unit was transfused to a female (patient E) with disseminated intravascular coagulation and septic shock, for which she was receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She died the following day. Blood cultures obtained at the onset of sepsis (pretransfusion) and 8 hours after transfusion both grew multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. The routine donors platelet bacterial screening collection, inoculated 24 hours after donation, was negative for growth through 5 days. The frozen plasma unit was not cultured and was discarded. K. pneumoniae isolates from three patient C blood cultures, patient Cs residual platelet product, and hos - pital Zs nontransfused platelets had similar antibiograms and were highly related by WGS, differing by only two single nucleotide polymorphisms (Supplementary Figure 2, https: // stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/56098) . However, pretransfusion and posttransfusion K. pneumoniae isolates from patient E demonstrated multidrug resistance and were unrelated from the other isolates using WGS. Patient Es possible source of sepsis was a pretransfusion urine infection with multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Investigation of the blood supplier and hospitals Y and Z indicated no procedural deviations. The donor met eligibility criteria and frequently donated platelets but had been deferred multiple times because of low hemoglobin. A platelet dona - tion 9 months earlier was positive for Enterobacter cloacae. After the report of the K. pneumoniae cluster, medical history assessments did not identify donor bacterial infection risks. Nontransfused blood products from the implicated donation were quarantined, and the donor was permanently deferred.

Discussion Platelet-transmitted bacterial infections persist as a cause of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality. Contamination of blood products most commonly occurs when skin micro - biota are introduced during needle insertion but can also occur from asymptomatic donor bacteremia (2) . Because the majority of platelets are stored at room temperature, bacteria can proliferate to clinically important levels by the time the unit is transfused (3) . Approximately one in 5, 000 platelet col - lections are contaminated with bacteria, and one in 100, 000 platelet transfusions results in bacterial sepsis (4) . T ransfusiontransmitted bacterial infections are likely underdiagnosed (2) because recipients are often given broad spectrum antibiotics or have underlying medical conditions that increase sepsis risk, or the septic reaction might not be attributed to the transfusion. Current practices to mitigate the risk for bacterial con - tamination of platelets include donor health screening, skin examination and disinfection, diversion of up to the first 40 mL of blood into a separate nontransfusable pouch to reduce the introduction of skin flora, visual inspection of platelet bags before transfusion, and aerobic bacterial culture screening (e. g. , monitoring an aliquot for bacterial growth) at least 24 hours after platelet collection (5) . Investigations confirmed that the Utah and California collection facilities followed current prac - tices. This report highlights that, even when following current practices, the risk for fatalities persists, making additional, important interventions necessary. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 721 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary What is already known about this topic? Platelet-transmitted bacterial infections persist as a cause of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality. What is added by this report? Whole genome sequencing was used to identify the source of fatal sepsis in three transfusion recipients resulting from bacterial contamination (Clostridium perfringens in Utah and Klebsiella pneumoniae in California) of platelet products. What are the implications for public health practice? Implementation of evidence-based strategies, including pathogen inactivation, rapid detection devices, and modified screening of bacterial culture protocols can mitigate the risk for bacterial contamination of platelets. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has several recommendations related to platelet contamination and donation. * FDA recommends that blood suppliers control the risk for bacterial contamination either by using a pathogen reduc-tion device or performing bacterial detection at least once. Additional requirements when a pathogen is identified include product quarantine, organism identification, determination whether the pathogen is endogenous to the donor blood stream, and, if so, donor deferral. Additional evidence-based risk mitigation strategies, includ - ing pathogen inactivation, rapid detection at point-of-use, and modification of screening bacterial culture protocols, can reduce the risk for platelet-transmitted bacterial sepsis (3) . Implementation of these modified and alternative strate - gies in the United States has been supported by advice from the FDAs Blood Products Advisory Committee but are not currently required (3) . Pathogen inactivation technology was adopted in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, and although no confirmed septic transfusion reactions were reported from 2. 3 million pathogen inactivationtreated platelet units, two possible cases have been reported after transfusion of pathogen inactivationtreated platelets (6) . This same pathogen inacti - vation technology is approved by FDA for use with apheresis platelets and plasma in the United States. Rapid bacterial detection devices, optimally used 72 hours after collection, can detect bacteria using <1 mL of platelet vol - ume but only have detection limits of 10 3106 organisms/mL. FDA has cleared one rapid device for extending platelet shelf life from 5 days to 7 days.  * Control of Bacterial Contamination of Platelets, 21 C. F. R.

R. , Sect. 630. 30 (2017) . https: //www. accessdata. fda. gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch. cfm? fr=630. 30.  https: //www. fda. gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ ApprovedProducts/SubstantiallyEquivalent510kDeviceInformation/ UCM551535. pdf. Additional risk mitigation strategies modify existing bacterial culture screening protocols. Current methods differ by blood sup - plier, with most inoculating 8 mL into an aerobic blood culture microbial detection system sampled 24 hours after collection to allow for sufficient bacterial growth. If cultures are negative after 1224 hours, platelet units are released and have a shelf life of up to 5 days, which can be extended up to 7 days with secondary testing (3) . However, 8 mL of platelets sampled 24 hours after donation might not have sufficient bacterial loads to detect bacte - rial growth in the screening culture (3) . Rather than using a fixed volume, one proposed strategy involves using a minimal propor - tional sample volume of 3. 8% of the platelet total collection (7) . In the United Kingdom, culture volumes of 16 mL are divided equally between aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles 3648 hours after donation and have resulted in no recognized fatalities after approximately 1. 8 million platelet units were transfused with shelf life extended to 7 days (8) . However, on several reported occasions, platelet bags were suspected of contamination after visual inspection, and subsequent cultures confirmed contamination. In Ireland, repeat aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures are performed 4 days after collection to extend platelet shelf life to 7 days; no septic transfusion reactions have been reported after >100, 000 apheresis collections (3) . Although reporting by blood systems that have adopted modified culture screening methods is promising, demonstrating important clinical benefit is difficult because transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis is rare. However, when compared with current detection practices in the United States, methods based on larger volume culture, delayed sampling of platelets, and performing aerobic and anaerobic cultures after collection are likely to result in fewer cases of platelet-transmitted bacterial infections. C. perfringens, a sporogenic gram-positive bacterium, has been rarely reported as the source of transfusion-associated sepsis (4) . Disinfectants used for skin antisepsis during blood collection are not sporicidal and might be ineffective in remov - ing C. perfringens from skin. K. pneumoniae, a gram-negative bacterium, is a common pathogen among transfusion-related fatalities (9) . Both pathogens might not be inactivated by pathogen inactivation  (10) but might have been detected with the modified culture strategies described above, which are not routinely practiced in the United States. Blood collection services could consider implementing enhanced safety interventions to reduce further the risk for bacterial contamination of platelets. Clinicians could consider bacterial contamination when patients develop sepsis during or after a platelet transfusion and rapidly investigate these transfusion reactions.  https: //www. fda. gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ ApprovedProducts/PremarketApprovalsPMAs/UCM427512. pdf.

Borisov, MD1; Sapna Bamrah Morris, MD1; Gibril J. Njie, MPH1; Carla A. Winston, PhD1; Deron Burton, MD1; Stefan Goldberg, MD1; Rachel Yelk Woodruff, MPH1; Leeanna Allen, MPH1; Philip LoBue, MD1; Andrew Vernon, MD1 T reatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is critical to the control and elimination of tuberculosis disease (TB) in the United States. In 2011, CDC recommended a short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) by directly observed therapy (DOT) for treatment of LTBI, with limitations for use in children aged <12 years and persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1) . CDC identified the use of 3HP in those populations, as well as self-administration of the 3HP regimen, as areas to address in updated recommendations. In 2017, a CDC Work Group conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of the 3HP regimen using methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. In total, 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis, which determined that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI regimens and achieves substantially higher treatment completion rates. In July 2017, the Work Group presented the meta-analysis findings to a group of TB experts, and in December 2017, CDC solicited input from the Advisory Council for the Elimination of T uberculosis (ACET) and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations. CDC continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1) in persons with LTBI aged 217 years; 2) in persons with LTBI who have HIV infection, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and are taking antiret-roviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine; and 3) by DOT or self-administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged 2 years. Systematic Review A CDC Work Group including epidemiologists, health scientists, physicians from CDCs T uberculosis Elimination program, and a CDC library specialist, was convened to con - duct the systematic literature review using methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services (2, 3) . The library specialist used a systematic search strategy to identify and retrieve intervention studies on the use of 3HP to treat LTBI that were published from January 2006 through June 2017 and indexed in the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Clinicaltrials. gov databases. To identify missed studies, reference lists from included articles were reviewed, and CDCs TB experts were consulted. This review included English language articles that met the follow - ing criteria: 1) the study design was randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental, observational cohort, or other design with a concurrent comparison group; 2) the target population included, but was not restricted to, persons aged 12 years, children aged 211 years, or persons with HIV infection; and 3) outcomes reported were prevention of TB disease, treatment completion, adverse events while on 3HP, discontinuation as a result of adverse events while on 3HP, or death while on 3HP. T wo reviewers from the CDC Work Group independently screened citations obtained from the search and retrieved full-text articles in the relevant literature to be synthesized. Using a standard data abstraction form, the reviewers abstracted data on intervention characteristics, outcomes of interest, demograph - ics, benefits, harms, considerations for implementation, and evidence gaps. Each study was also assessed for threats to inter - nal and external validity per Guide to Community Preventive Services standards (2, 3) . Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by consensus of the CDC Work Group members. The CDC Work Group reviewed 292 citations retrieved from the librarians search. Of these, 30 full-text articles were ordered and screened for inclusion. No eligible studies includ - ing children aged <2 years were identified. In total, 19 articles representing 15 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Findings from the meta-analysis indicated that 3HP is as safe and effective as other recommended LTBI regimens and achieves significantly higher treatment completion rates. Complete results of the systematic review and meta-analysis have been published elsewhere (4) . Overall, the majority of included studies were of greatest design suitability and good quality of execution, as defined by the Guide to Community Preventive Services (2, 3) . Issues related to poor reporting of appropriate analytic methods and possible selection bias were the most common limitations assigned to the body of evidence. Recently published randomized control trials that were heav - ily weighted in the meta-analyses and drug interaction studies (59) are summarized as follows: Study of 3HP in children. A large randomized clinical trial of 3HP administered by DOT, which included children aged 217 years, demonstrated that 3HP was as well-tolerated and as effective as 9 months of daily isoniazid (9H) for preventing TB (5) . The trial also reported that 3HP was safe and had higher treatment completion rates than 9H (5) . Data on the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 724 MMWR / June 29, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 25 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsafety and pharmacokinetics of rifapentine in children aged <2 years are not available. Studies of 3HP in persons with HIV infection, including AIDS. In 2011, CDC recommended the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in persons with HIV infection, including AIDS, who are otherwise healthy and who are not taking antiretroviral medications (1) . Since that time, additional data confirm not only the effectiveness of 3HP in persons with HIV infection who are not taking antiretroviral therapy, but also demonstrate the absence of clinically significant drug interac-tions between once-weekly rifapentine and either efavirenz or raltegravir in persons with HIV infection who are treated with those antiretroviral medications (4, 68) . Study of self-administered therapy. A randomized clinical trial demonstrating noninferior treatment completion and safety of 3HP-SAT compared with 3HP-DOT in persons aged 18 years in the United States provides the primary evidence on 3HP administration by SAT (9) . The 3HP-SAT regimen has not been studied in randomized controlled trials in persons aged <18 years. Expert Consultation In July 2017, CDC met with nine non-CDC subject matter experts in TB and LTBI diagnosis, treatment, prevention, sur - veillance, epidemiology, clinical research, pulmonology, pediat - rics, HIV/AIDS, public health programs, and patient advocacy. CDC presented the systematic review results and proposed recommendations to the experts, who provided 1) individual perspectives on the review; 2) experience with implementation of the 3HP regimen in various settings and populations; and 3) individual viewpoints on the proposed updates. Subject matter experts from programs prescribing 3HP described benefits of this regimen, including increased acceptance and completion of treatment. Some experts reported that several health departments are currently using 3HP, with high treat - ment completion, in children as young as age 2 years. Some noted that the 2011 recommendation to administer 3HP by DOT limits use of the regimen. In December 2017, CDC solicited input from ACET and members of the public for incorporation into the final recommendations. With regard to pediatric use, the 2011 recommendations had included limited use of the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in children aged <12 years (1) . New data on efficacy and safety of 3HP in children were determined sufficient to recommend the 3HP regimen for treatment of LTBI in chil - dren aged 2 years (4) . Concerning patients with HIV infection, information about interactions between specific antimycobacterial agents, including rifamycins (e. g. , rifampin, rifabutin, and rifapentine) and antiretroviral agents, is available in the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents. These frequently updated guidelines include a section addressing management of LTBI in persons with HIV coinfection and tables with information on drug interactions. * Use of concomitant LTBI treatment and antiretroviral agents should be guided by clinicians experienced in the management of both conditions. In 2011, CDC recommended use of the 3HP regimen by DOT (1) . T reatment completion rates are highest when the regimen is administered by DOT (4) . However, the burden and expense of DOT is greater than that for SAT (9) . During the expert consultation and again during review by ACET, some subject matter experts strongly recommended permit - ting use of SAT, when combined with clinical monitoring, in children aged 2 years. Based on this expert opinion, ACET formally recommended expansion of the option of parentally administered SAT to children. Some experts still prefer DOT for treating LTBI in children aged 25 years, in whom risk for TB progression and severe disease is higher than that in older children and adults. Health care providers should make joint decisions about SAT with each individual patient (and parent or legal guardian), considering program resources and the patients age, medical history, social circumstances, and risk factors for progression to severe TB disease. Subject mat-ter experts stressed the importance of educating providers and patients about 3HP. Recommendations Based on evidence on effectiveness, safety, and treatment completion rates from the systematic review, and after consid-eration of viewpoints from TB subject matter experts and input from ACET and the public, CDC continues to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP 1) in persons with LTBI aged 217 years; 2) in persons with LTBI who have HIV infection, including AIDS, and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine; and 3) by DOT or SAT in persons aged 2 years. The health care provider should choose the mode of admin - istration (DOT versus SAT) based on local practice, individual patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations, including risk for progression to severe forms of TB disease. Use of concomitant LTBI treatment and antiretroviral agents should be guided by clinicians experienced in the management of both conditions (Box 1) . * https: //aidsinfo. nih. gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv/367/overview.

Updated recommendations for once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection CDC continues to recommend use of the short-course combination regimen of once-weekly isoniazid-rifapentine for 12 weeks (3HP) for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in adults. With regard to age limits, HIV infection, and administration of the treatment, CDC now also recommends the following:  use of 3HP in persons aged 217 years;  use of 3HP in persons with LTBI who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug-drug interactions with rifapentine*; and  use of 3HP by directly observed therapy (DOT) or self-administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged 2 years; the health care provider should choose the mode of administration (DOT versus SAT) based on local practice, individual patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations, including risk for progression to severe forms of tuberculosis disease. * https: //aidsinfo. nih. gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv/367/ overview. Patient monitoring and adverse events. Hepatic enzymes and other blood tests should be performed for certain patients before initiation of 3HP therapy (Box 2) . Approximately 4% of all patients using 3HP experience flu-like or other systemic drug reactions, with fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, muscle and bone pain, rash, itching, red eyes, or other symptoms (4, 10) . Approximately 5% of persons discontinue 3HP because of adverse events, including systemic drug reactions (4, 10); these reactions typically occur after the first 34 doses, and begin approximately 4 hours after ingestion of medication (10) . Hypotension and syncope have been reported rarely (two cases per 1, 000 persons treated) (4, 10) . If symptoms suggestive of a systemic drug reaction occur, patients should stop 3HP while the cause is determined. Symptoms usually resolve without treatment within 24 hours. Neutropenia and elevation of liver enzymes occur uncommonly (4, 10) . CDC recommends that health care providers educate patients to report adverse events. Patient use of symptom checklists might facilitate timely rec - ognition and reporting.  Rifapentine is a rifamycin compound; like rifampin, it induces metabolism of many medications. CDC recommends monitoring of patients when 3HP is prescribed with interacting  Examples of patients medication intake log and symptoms checklists are available at https: //www. cdc. gov/tb/publications/pamphlets/12-doseregimen. htm. BOX 2. Guidance to health care providers during treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with a combination regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine in 12 once-weekly doses (3HP)  Evaluate all patients for active tuberculosis disease both before and during treatment of LTBI.  Inform the patient or parents or legal guardians about possible adverse effects and instruct them to seek medical attention when symptoms of possible adverse reaction first appear; particularly drug hypersensitivity reactions, rash, hypotension, or thrombocytopenia.  Conduct monthly evaluations to assess treatment adherence and adverse effects, with repeated patient education regarding adverse effects at each visit.  Order baseline hepatic chemistry blood tests (at least aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) for patients with the following specific conditions: human immunodeficiency virus infection, liver disorders, postpartum period (3 months after delivery), regular alcohol use, injection drug use, or use of medications with known possible interactions.  Conduct blood tests at subsequent clinical encounters for patients whose baseline testing is abnormal and for others at risk for liver disease. Discontinue 3HP if a serum AST concentration is 5 times the upper limit of normal in the absence of symptoms or 3 times the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms.  In case of a possible severe adverse reaction, discontinue 3HP and provide supportive medical care. Conservative management and continuation of 3HP under observation can be considered in the presence of mild to moderate adverse events as determined by health care provider. medications (e. g. , methadone or warfarin) . Rifapentine can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives; therefore, women who use hormonal birth control should be advised to add, or switch to, a barrier method. Women should be advised to inform their health care provider if they decide to try to become pregnant or become pregnant during 3HP treatment. Because altered dosing might reduce effectiveness or safety, patients on 3HP SAT should be encouraged to record medica - tion intake and report deviations from the prescribed regimen. Persons on 3HP regimens should be evaluated monthly (in person or by telephone) to assess adherence and adverse effects. Additional studies are needed to understand the pharmaco - kinetics, safety, and tolerance of 3HP in children aged <2 years; adherence and safety of 3HP-SAT in persons aged <18 years; and safety of 3HP during pregnancy (4) .

J. Shannon, MPH1; Sara Blosser, PhD2; Maroya Walters, PhD3; Alex Kallen, MD3; Christine Feaster, MS1 Beginning in January 2016, Verona integron-mediated metallo--lactamase (VIM) producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were identified in Indiana. CRE are an emerging antibiotic-resistant public health threat. CRE spread might be largely due to the emergence of car - bapenemase-producing CRE (CP-CRE) . Carbapenemases are generally encoded on mobile genetic elements that are easily transferred between bacterial strains, greatly increasing their potential for spread (13) . Furthermore, CP-CRE pose a risk because of their extensive drug resistance, increased associated mortality, and national lack of public health laboratory capacity for detection prior to 2016 (2, 4, 5) . The geographic distribution of carbapenemases varies glob - ally. In the United States, the carbapenemase most frequently identified among Enterobacteriaceae is Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase; others are less common and are most often identified in patients who recently received health care outside the United States. For example, VIM is frequently identified in southern Europe and Southeast Asia; however, it is infrequently reported from the United States (13) . In December 2015, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) mandated reporting of CP-CRE, allowing for state - wide identification and response to CP-CRE. To facilitate this reporting, the ISDH laboratories hosted CP-CRE workshops in which clinical laboratorians were trained in the detection of carbapenemases via currently available phenotypic testing methods. The ISDH laboratories provide CP-CRE char - acterization in real time, allowing for timely public health intervention. Upon detection of CP-CRE, the ISDH provides education and technical assistance to health care facilities to ensure rapid implementation of proper infection control procedures. Each patient from whom a CP-CRE isolate is identified is investigated by the local health department to characterize demographics and CP-CRE risk factors, including recent health care exposures and international travel during the preceding 6 months. During January 2016December 2017, 649 CP-CRE isolates were reported across Indiana, including nine VIM-producing CP-CRE (VIM-CRE) isolates from seven patients. VIM was the most commonly identified carbapenemase after Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase. Seven different species were identified from the nine VIM-producing isolates; one patient was found be colonized or infected with three different VIM-producing organisms over a 15-month period (Table) . All seven patients had overnight stays in Indiana health care facilities, and none had documented international travel in the 6 months preceding specimen collection. Improved isolate submission and expanded capacity to detect carbapenemase-producing organisms have identified VIM-CRE as an emerging resistance problem in Indiana. All patients with VIM-CRE reported recent health care in Indiana but had not traveled outside the country, suggesting VIM transmission within Indiana health care facilities. Notably, although VIM remains one of the least frequently reported carbapenemases among CRE in the United States, Indiana and neighboring states account for 29 (71%) of the 41 VIM-CRE reported to CDC to date, suggesting possible regional emergence of this resistance mechanism (6) . This finding highlights the important role of state public health laboratories in facilitating identification and reporting of CRE by clinical laboratories and in testing isolates to identify important CRE resistance mechanisms, including all five carbapenemases of major public health concern. * Although such testing has had limited availability in clinical and public health laboratories, recent CDC investments to create the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network have increased carbapenemase testing and CRE screening nationwide. This testing will provide better understanding of CP-CRE epidemiology throughout the United States, including important regional differences in emerging carbapenemases (6) . Once CP-CRE are identi - fied, health department epidemiologists can work to ensure prompt implementation of infection control interventions. This collaboration between epidemiologists and laboratorians to identify, describe, and respond to emerging drug resistance is needed for containment efforts.

Residential care communities include those that were state-regulated; had four or more beds; and provided room and board with at least two meals a day, around-the-clock on-site supervision, and help with personal care, such as bathing and dressing or health-related services such as medication management. Residential care communities licensed exclusively to serve the mentally ill or the intellectually or developmentally disabled populations were excluded; residential care communities with missing data were excluded.  Respondents were asked An Electronic Health Record is a computerized version of the residents health and personal information used in the management of the residents health care. Other than for accounting or billing purposes, does this residential care community use electronic health records?  The U. S. Census Bureau defines four regions comprising the following states: Northeast: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont; Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; South: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia; West: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. In 2016, 26% of residential care communities used electronic health records (EHRs) . The percentage that used EHRs was 36% of communities in the Northeast, 41% of communities in the Midwest, 24% of communities in the South, and 17% of communities in the West.
