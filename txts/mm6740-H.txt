U. S. Department of Health and Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control and PreventionNational Latinx AIDS Awareness Day  October 15, 2018 National Latinx AIDS Awareness Day (https: //www. cdc. gov/Features/LatinoAIDSAwareness), October 15, is observed each year to focus on the continuing and disproportionate impact of human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome (AIDS) on Hispanics/Latinos in the UnitedStates. The prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection amongHispanics/Latinos is approximately twice that amongnon-Hispanic whites (1) . The percentage of persons withdiagnosed infection who are virally suppressed (<200copies of HIV RNA per mL of blood) is lower amongHispanics/Latinos than among non-Hispanic whites (2) . An analysis of clinical outcomes among Hispanic/Latino par - ticipants in CDCs Medical Monitoring Project (2013 and 2014 cycles) found that a significantly higher percentage of women (78%), compared with men (54%), were living in poverty (3) . However, women and men were equally likely to have received prescriptions for antiretroviral therapy (95% versus 96%) and to have durable viral suppression (68% versus 73%) (3) . National Latinx AIDS Awareness Day is an opportunity to encourage increased HIV prevention activities among Hispanics/Latinos. CDC supports testing; linkage to, and engagement in, care and treatment; and other efforts to reduce the risk for acquir - ing or transmitting HIV infection among Hispanics/Latinos.

Remington, MD, MPH Carlos Roig, MS, MA William Schaffner, MDthe 2013 and 2014 cycles of the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) were analyzed to describe demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics among Hispanics/Latinos by sex. MMP is an annual cross-sectional, nationally representative surveillance system that, during 20132014, collected infor - mation about behaviors, medical care, and clinical outcomes among adults receiving outpatient HIV care. Hispanic/Latina women were significantly more likely than were men to live in poverty (78% versus 54%), report not speaking English well (38% versus 21%), and receive interpreter (27% versus 16%), transportation (35% versus 21%), and meal (44% versus 26%) services. There were no significant differences between Hispanic/Latino women and men in prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (95% versus 96%) or sustained viral suppression (68% versus 73%) . Although women faced greater socioeconomic and language-related challenges, the clinical outcomes among Hispanic/Latina women were similar to those among men, perhaps reflecting their higher use of ancillary services. Levels of viral suppression for Hispanics/Latinos are lower than those found among non-Hispanic whites (3) and lower than the national prevention goal of at least 80% of persons with diagnosed HIV infection. Providers should be cognizant of the challenges faced by Hispanics/Latinos with HIV infection in care and provide referrals to needed ancillary services. MMP data were collected annually during 20132014 using three consecutive sampling stages (states and territories, outpatient HIV facilities, and patients), and response rates for the two cycle-years of data that were included in the analysis were 100% (states and territories), 85%86% (outpatient HIV facilities) and 55%56% (patients) . Data were collected using face-to-face or telephone interviews and medical record abstraction from June 2013 through May 2015. The analysis included 1, 774 men and 577 women who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, regardless of race. Data were self-reported from the interview and abstracted from the respondents medical record. Data were weighted based on known probabilities of selection and adjusted for facility and patient non-response. Rao-Scott chi-square tests were used to assess differences by sex; p-values <0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Selected sociodemographic and behav-ioral variables, use of ancillary services, and clinical outcomes are presented by sex. All analyses accounted for the complex sample design and weights. Women were significantly more likely than were men to live in poverty (78% versus 54%), live in a household with 1 dependents aged <18 years (66% versus 37%), have public insurance coverage (72% versus 54%) and, among those living outside of Puerto Rico, report not speaking English well (38% versus 21%) (Table 1) . Compared with men, women were less likely to have more than a high school education (28% versus 47%), be employed (29% versus 48%), have any private insurance (14% versus 22%), and have been born outside the United States (36% versus 45%) . Women most often reported their country or region of origin in the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico) (38%), followed by the mainland United States Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 1111 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (33%) . Men most often reported the mainland United States as their country or region of origin (36%), followed by Mexico and Central America (32%) (Table 1) . Women were also less likely than were men to report using stimulants (3% versus 10%), non-injection drugs (8% versus 23%), injection drugs (0. 4% versus 3%), or any opioids (0. 8% versus 3%) (Table 2) . Women were more likely than men to receive interpreter (27% versus 16%), transportation (35% versus 21%), and meal services (44% versus 26%) . Women did not report a greater unmet need for these services than did men. Among women and men, prescription of antiretroviral therapy (95% versus 96%) and prevalence of sustained viral suppression (68% versus 73%) did not significantly differ. TABLE 1.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1112 MMWR / Oct ober 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDiscussion Compared with men, more Hispanic/Latina women with HIV infection in care faced socioeconomic and languagerelated challenges than did men; however, they had similar prevalences of ART prescription and viral suppression. Hispanic/Latina women used ancillary services at higher rates than did Hispanic/Latino men, perhaps mitigating the effects of the noted challenges on their clinical outcomes. The poverty rate among Hispanics or Latinos in the United States is approximately twice that of non-Hispanic whites, and women live in poverty at higher rates than do men (4) . This study found that 78% of Hispanic/Latina women receiving HIV care lived at or below the federal household poverty level, compared with 54% of men. Poverty is known to affect man - agement of HIV infection and is a paramount concern affecting all stages of the HIV care continuum (5) . Some ART regimens require food; thus, lack of food might lead to nonadherence. Lack of transportation might pose barriers to attending medi - cal appointments and obtaining medications. Womens higher receipt of meal and transportation services might have helped alleviate the negative consequences of food insecurity and lack of transportation on their clinical outcomes. Among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, Hispanics/Latinos are the group least likely to have any health insurance coverage (6) . In this study, 22% of Hispanic/Latino men and 14% of Hispanic/Latina women had any private health insurance. However, 72% of Hispanic/Latina women and 54% of men relied on public insurance only. Taken together, 87% of women and 76% of men had some type of coverage. The higher coverage among women might also have contributed to similar clinical outcomes between men and women. Moreover, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides comprehensive care as well as support services for persons living with HIV infection who have no insurance or are underinsured and is associated with improved clinical outcomes among persons in poverty (7) . Overall, 38% of women and 21% of men reported not speaking English well, which can affect ability to understand a providers instructions and ability to navigate the health care system (8) . In addition, the language barrier might prevent care TABLE 2.

Bilingual providers or interpreter services might have mitigated linguistic barriers. Lower levels of substance abuse might also have contributed to better clinical outcomes among Hispanic/Latina women receiving HIV care. Persons who use drugs have been found to have lower levels of adherence (9) and, therefore, lower levels of sustained viral suppression, which is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality and preventing transmission to others. Hispanics/Latinos in HIV care still have higher levels of unmet need for services when compared with other popula - tions (10) . Although no disparities between men and women in sustained viral suppression among Hispanics/Latinos were identified, levels are still lower than those found among non-Hispanic whites (3) and lower than the national prevention goal of at least 80% viral suppression for persons with diag - nosed HIV infection. Through partnerships that use a high-impact approach to advancing national HIV prevention goals, CDC works to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV transmission among all Americans. CDC provides support and assistance to health departments and community-based organizations deliver effective interventions to decrease HIV incidence among Hispanic/Latinos, improve their health outcomes, and reduce transmission. CDC also raises awareness about HIV among Hispanics/Latinos through Partnering and Communicating Together to Act Against AIDS (PACT), * which includes the National Hispanic Medical Association and is part of the larger Act Against AIDS initiative. * https: //www. cdc. gov/actagainstaids/partnerships/pact. html. The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita - tions. First, the results might not be applicable to Hispanic/Latinos living with HIV infection who are not receiving medi - cal care. Second, behavioral characteristics are self-reported and thus, might be subject to measurement error as well as report - ing and social desirability biases. Finally, data were adjusted to minimize nonresponse bias based on known characteristics of sampled facilities and patients; however, the possibility of residual nonresponse bias exists. Hispanic/Latino men and women with HIV-infection in care differ from one another in their behavioral and sociodemo - graphic characteristics. Hispanic/Latina women receiving HIV care face more socioeconomic and language-related challenges than do men. However, rates of ART prescription and sustained viral suppression did not differ between Hispanic/Latino men and women, perhaps reflecting Hispanic/Latina womens greater use of ancillary services. It is important for providers to be cognizant of the challenges faced by this population and assist with access to needed ancillary services. Although the lack of disparity in viral suppression among Hispanic/Latino men and women in HIV care is encouraging, work still remains to decrease ethnic disparities and attain national prevention goals among this population.

The prevalence of diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among Hispanics/Latinos in the United States is approximately twice that of non-Hispanic whites. Describing Hispanics/Latinos with HIV-infection in medical care by sex could inform service delivery. What is added by this report? During 20132014, among Hispanics/Latinos with HIV infection in care, women were significantly more likely than were men to live in poverty, have English language difficulties, and receive ancillary services. Prescription of antiretroviral therapy and sustained viral suppression did not significantly differ by sex. What are the implications for public health practice? Providers should be cognizant of the challenges faced by Hispanics/Latinos with HIV-infection in care and provide referrals to needed ancillary services.

Mellerson, MPH1, 2; Choppell B. Maxwell, DrPH1, 2; Cynthia L. Knighton2; Jennifer L. Kriss, PhD2; Ranee Seither, MPH2; Carla L. Black, PhD2 State and local school vaccination requirements exist to ensure that students are protected from vaccine-preventable diseases (1) . This report summarizes vaccination coverage and exemption estimates collected by state and local immunization programs* for children in kindergarten (kindergartners) in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) and kindergartners provisionally enrolled (attending school without complete vaccination or exemption while completing a catch-up vac - cination schedule) or in a grace period (a set interval during which a student may be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption) for 28 states. Median vaccination coverage  was 95. 1% for the state-required number of doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and acel - lular pertussis vaccine (DTaP); 94. 3% for 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR); and 93. 8% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine. The median percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from at least one vaccine  was 2. 2%, and the median percentage provisionally enrolled or attending school during a grace period was 1. 8%. Vaccination coverage among kindergartners remained high; however, schools can improve coverage by following up with students who are provisionally enrolled, in a grace period, or lacking complete documentation of required vaccinations. Federally funded immunization programs collaborate with departments of education, school nurses, and other school personnel to assess vaccination coverage and exemption status of children enrolled in public and private kindergartens.  In * Federally funded immunization programs are located in the 50 states and DC, five cities, and eight U. S territories and freely associated states (territories) . T wo cities reported data to CDC, which were included in their state data to calculate medians. Immunization programs in U. S. territories reported vaccination coverage andexemptions to CDC; however, these data were not included in median calculations.  Median vaccination coverage was determined using estimates for 49 states and DC; Wyoming did not report data because of problems with the quality ofdata reported by schools. Data from cities were included with their state data. Data from territories were not included in median calculation.  Median exemption rate was determined using estimates for 45 states and DC; Wyoming did not report data because of problems with the quality of datareported by schools; Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri were included in the tables and figure but excluded from the median exemption rate because they did not collect information on the number of kindergartners with anexemption. Data from cities were included with their state data. Data fromterritories were not included in median calculation.  Assessment date varied by state and area. Sev en states assess on the first day of school; 18 states assess by December 31; 12 states assess by some other date, rangingfrom 30 days after admission to March 5; 12 states and DC assess on a rolling basis. accordance with state and local school entry requirements, parents and guardians submit childrens vaccination records or exemption forms to schools, or schools obtain records from state immunization information systems. During the 201718 school year, 49 states and DC reported coverage for all state-required vaccines and exemption data among public school kindergartners; 48 states and DC reported on private school kindergartners. ** Median vaccination coverage for the state-required number of doses of DTaP, 2 doses of MMR, and 2 doses of varicella vaccine are reported. Coverage with hepatitis B and poliovirus vaccines, which are required in most states but not included in this report, are presented on SchoolVaxView (2) . T wenty-eight states reported data on kin - dergartners who, at the time of assessment, attended school under a grace period or provisional enrollment. Immunization programs in U. S. territories also receive public funding for immunization and report vaccination coverage and exemptions to CDC; however, national medians and summary measures reported here include only the U. S. states and DC. Vaccination coverage and exemption estimates were adjusted according to survey type and response rates.  During the 201718 school year, vaccination coverage data were reported for approximately 3, 988, 127 kindergartners, exemption data for approximately 3, 634, 631, and grace period and provisional ** Six states reported coverage and exemption data for at least some homeschooled kindergartners. California included data for 18 independent study schools and eight virtual schools in public school data and data for homeschools with six or more students in private school data. North Dakota reported some homeschool data separately. Oregon reported some homeschool data separately; children enrolled in public online homeschools were included in the public school data. Pennsylvania included all homeschooled students in their public school data. Utah included some homeschooled students in public and private school data. Vermont included homeschooled students in their public and private school data if the students were enrolled in one or more classes at a school; homeschooled children who were exclusively homeschooled were not subject to vaccination requirements and were not included in these estimates.  Most immunization programs that used census or voluntary response provided CDC with data aggregated at the state or local (city or territory) level. Coverage and exemption data based on a census or voluntary response were adjusted for nonresponse using the inverse of the response rate, stratified by school type (public, private, and homeschool, where available) . Programs that used complex sample surveys provided CDC with deidentified data aggregated at the school or county level for weighted analysis. Weights were calculated to account for sample design and adjusted for nonresponse for data collected through complex sample design wherever possible. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1116 MMWR / Oct ober 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionenrollment data for approximately 2, 825, 691. Potentially achievable coverage for MMR was calculated for each state as the percentage of students vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR plus the percentage without 2 doses of MMR and no docu - mented vaccination exemption. Nonexempt students included those provisionally enrolled, in a grace period, or otherwise without documentation of vaccination. During the 201718 school year, vaccination assessments varied by immunization program because of differences in states required vaccines and doses, vaccines assessed, assessment methods, and data reported. Among the 49 states and DC reporting kindergar - ten vaccination data, 36 used a census; nine used a sample; three used a voluntary school response; and two used a mix of sampling methods.  All states used the same methods to collect both vaccination coverage and exemption data except Alaska, Kansas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, where a sample was used for vaccination coverage data and a census for exemption data. Kindergartners were considered up to date and included in the coverage estimate for a given vaccine if they received all doses required for school entry, *** except in seven states  that considered kindergartners up to date only if they received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry. Reporting of varicella vaccination status among kindergartners with a history of varicella disease varied within and among states; some were reported as vaccinated against varicella and others as medically exempt. Among the 49 states and DC included in this analysis, median 2-dose MMR coverage was 94. 3% (range = 81. 3% [DC] to 99. 4% [Mississippi]), 23 states reported coverage 95%, and three states and DC reported coverage <90% (Table 1) . Median DTaP coverage was 95. 1% (range = 79. 7% [DC] to 99. 4% [Mississippi]), 25 states reported coverage 95%, and  The kindergarten population is an approximation pr ovided by each immunization program. The totals reported here are the summations of the kindergarten population among programs reporting data for coverage, exemptions, and grace periods or provisional enrollment. Data from cities and territories were not included in these totals.  States using a census attempted to collect data from all kindergartners at all schools and succeeded in collecting data for 90% of kindergartners. The type of sample employed by the nine states using a sample to collect coverage data varied and included a stratified two-stage cluster sample (eight states) and a stratified one-stage cluster sample (one state) . A voluntary response of schools was defined as a census survey with a response rate <90% of the known population of kindergartners. A mix of methods included two or more described sampling methods (a census for one school type and voluntary response for the other) . *** All 49 reporting states and DC required 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine. Local DTaP requirements varied. Nebraska required 3 doses, four states (Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, and Wisconsin) required 4 doses, and all other states required 5 doses, unless the fourth dose was administered on or after the fourth birthday. The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of kindergartners with the state-required number of DTaP doses, except for Kentucky, which required 5 doses of DTaP by age 5 years, but reported 4-dose coverage for kindergartners. Nine states required 1 dose of varicella vaccine; 41 states and DC required 2 doses.  Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New Jersey considered kindergartners up to date only if they had received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry. three states and DC reported coverage <90%. Among the 41 states and DC that required and reported 2 doses of varicella vaccine, median coverage was 93. 8% (range = 80. 5% [DC] to 99. 4% [Mississippi]), 17 states reported coverage 95%, and four states and DC reported coverage <90%. The median percentage of kindergartners with an exemp - tion from one or more required vaccines (not limited to MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccines) was 2. 2% (range = 0. 1% [Mississippi] to 7. 6% [Oregon]), compared with 2. 0% during the 201617 school year (Table 2) . The median percentage of medical exemptions was 0. 2% (range = <0. 1% [Hawaii] to 0. 8% [Alaska]); the median percentage of nonmedical exemptions was 2. 0% (range = <0. 1% [California] to 7. 5% [Oregon]) . Among the 29 states and DC with an increase in exemptions in 201718, vaccination coverage was 95% in 15 states for MMR, 16 states for DTaP, and 11 states for 2 doses of varicella. The median reported percentage of kindergartners attend - ing school during a grace period or provisionally enrolled was 1. 8% (range = 0. 2% [Georgia and Hawaii] to 8. 5% [Arkansas]) (Table 2) . In 11 of 28 states reporting for the 201718 school year, the percentage of children provisionally enrolled or within a grace period at the time of the assessment exceeded the percentage of children with exemptions from 1 vaccines. Among the 26 states and DC with MMR coverage <95%, 20 could potentially achieve 95% coverage if all nonexempt students who were provisionally enrolled, in a grace period, or otherwise without evidence of complete vaccination were vaccinated (Figure) . Discussion During the 201718 school year, median kindergarten vaccination coverage was close to 95% for MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccine. The number of states with coverage 95% increased from 20 to 23 (MMR), 23 to 25 (DTaP), and 15 to 17 (2 varicella vaccine doses) since the 201617 school year (2, 3) . Coverage increases in selected states might result from modifications to state programs. For example, Pennsylvania reduced its provisional enrollment period from 240 days to 5 days with a medical certificate indicating the scheduling of missing vaccine doses. The Indiana State Department of Health initiated report cards for schools displaying kindergarten vaccination coverage rates and built a bidirectional interface that increased the amount of data in their immunization information system. Kentucky removed the provider signature requirement when printing a certificate of immunization status, allowing school nurses to use the immunization information system certificate to document vaccination history.

Although the overall percentage of children with an exemp - tion was low, this was the third consecutive school year that a slight increase was observed (2) . Reasons for the increase can - not be determined from the data reported to CDC but could include the ease of the procedure for obtaining exemptions (4) or parental vaccine hesitancy (5) . Reported exemptions do not distinguish between exemptions for one vaccine versus all vaccines. Previous studies indicate that most children with exemptions have received at least some vaccines (68) . Recent data from the National Immunization Survey indicate the percentage of children reaching age 2 years without having received any vaccinations has increased gradually, from 0. 9% for children born in 2011 to 1. 3% for children born in 2015 TABLE 1.

Estimates based on a completed vaccine series (i. e. , not vaccine-specific) use the  symbol. Coverage might include history of disease or laboratory evidence of immunity.  The kindergarten population is an approximation provided by each program.  Sample designs varied by state or area: census = program attempted to include all schools (public and private) and all children within schools in the assessment and had a student response rate of 90%; 1-stage or 2-stage cluster sample = schools were randomly selected, and all children in the selected schools were assessed (1-stage), or a random sample of children within the schools was selected (2-stage); voluntary response = a census with a student response rate of <90% (does not imply that participation was optional) .  Some programs publish kindergarten vaccination data online that are more detailed than the state-level estimates in this table. Examples of more detailed data include county, parish, school district, and school-level estimates. ** Most states require 2 doses of MMR; Alaska, New Jersey, and Oregon require 2 doses of measles, 1 dose of mumps, and 1 dose of rubella vaccines. Georgia, New York, New York City, North Carolina, and Virginia require 2 doses of measles and mumps and 1 dose of rubella vaccines. Iowa requires 2 doses of measles and 2 doses of rubella vaccines.  Pertussis vaccination coverage might include some diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis vaccine (DTP) vaccinations if administered in another country or by a vaccination provider who continued to use DTP after 2000. Most states require 5 doses of DTaP for school entry, or 4 doses if the fourth dose was received on or after the fourth birthday; Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, and Wisconsin require 4 doses; Nebraska requires 3 doses. The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of kindergartners with the state-required number of DTaP doses, except for Kentucky, which requires 5 but reports 4 doses of DTaP.  Medians calculated from data from 49 states and the District of Columbia (i. e. , does not include Wyoming, Houston, New York City, American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, or U. S. Virgin Islands) . Coverage data were reported for 3, 988, 127 kindergartners.  The percentage surveyed likely was <100%, but is reported as 100% based on incomplete information about the actual current enrollment. *** Did not include some types of schools, such as online schools or those locat ed on military bases or in correctional facilities.  Kindergarten vaccination coverage data were collected from a sample, and exemption data were collected from a census of kindergartners.  Counted some or all vaccine doses received regardless of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended age and time interval; vaccination coverage rates reported might be higher than those for valid doses.  For Palau, estimates represent coverage among children in first grade. **** Reported public school data only.  Puerto Rico and U. S. Virgin Islands did not report data for the 201718 school year because of widespread logistical issues caused by Hurricane Maria.

T wo of the 10 states with <90% coverage for 1 dose of MMR among children aged 1935 months in the 2014 National Immunization Survey (10) (the approximate cohort of children entering kindergarten in the 201718 school year) also had <90% coverage for 2 doses of MMR among kinder - gartners in 201718; in eight states, coverage with 2 doses of MMR was <95%, indicating that some children who were undervaccinated in early childhood do not catch up before kindergarten entry. This highlights the importance of school entry vaccination requirements to ensure catch-up vaccination of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children. In 11 of the 28 states reporting 201718 grace period or provisional enrollment data, the percentage of kindergartners in these groups at the time of assessment exceeded the percentage with an exemption from one or more vaccines, representing a group of children who could be fully vaccinated with appropri - ate follow-up. CDC encourages programs to collect and use these data to identify populations of undervaccinated students. Almost all states could achieve 95% vaccination coverage if undervaccinated nonexempt children were vaccinated in accordance with local and state vaccination policies. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita - tions. First, comparability is limited because of variation in states requirements, data collection methods, and definitions of grace period and provisional enrollment. Second, representa - tiveness might be negatively affected because of data collection methodologies that miss some schools or students or assess vaccination status at different times. Third, actual vaccination coverage, exemption rates, or both might be underestimated or overestimated because of inaccurate or absent documenta - tion. Fourth, median coverage estimates include only 49 of 50 states and DC, median exemption estimates include only 45 states and DC, and the median grace period or provisional enrollment estimate includes only 28 states for the 201718 TABLE 2.

Medical exemptions, nonmedical exemptions, and grace period or provisional enrollment status might not be mutually exclusive. Some children might have both medical and nonmedical exemptions, and some enrolled under a grace period or provisional enrollment might be exempt from one or more vaccinations.  A grace period is a set number of days during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption. Provisional enrollment allows a student without complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule. In states with one or both of these policies, the estimates represent the number of kindergartners within a grace period, provisionally enrolled, or some combination of these categories.  Medians calculated from data from 45 states and District of Columbia; states excluded were Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wyoming. Houston, New York City, American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and U. S. Virgin Islands also were excluded. Exemption data were reported for 3, 634, 631 kindergartners. Grace period or provisional enrollment median was calculated from data from 28 states; data were reported for 2, 825, 691 kindergartners. ** Philosophical exemptions were not allowed.  Religious exemptions were not allowed.  Religious and philosophical exemptions were not reported separately.  Program did not report the number of children with exemptions, but instead reported the number of exemptions for each vaccine, which could count some children more than once. Lower bounds of the percentage of children with any exemptions estimated using the individual vaccines with the highest number of exemptions are for Colorado, 0. 2% with medical exemptions, 0. 3% with religious exemptions, 4. 2% with philosophical exemptions, and 4. 7% with any exemptions; for Illinois, 0. 2% with medical exemptions, 1. 4% with religious exemptions, and 1. 6% with any exemptions; for Minnesota, 0. 2% with medical exemptions, 3. 4% with nonmedical exemptions, and 3. 5% with any exemptions; and for Missouri, 0. 2% with medical exemptions, 2. 1% with religious exemptions, and 2. 3% with any exemptions. *** Reported public school data only.

Finally, because most states do not report vaccinespecific exemptions, estimates of potentially achievable MMR coverage are approximations. However, if reported exemptions were for a vaccine or vaccines other than MMR, estimates of potentially achievable MMR coverage would be higher than those presented. Kindergarten vaccination requirements help ensure that stu - dents are fully vaccinated with age-appropriate vaccines upon school entry. Although overall vaccination coverage is high, coverage could be improved in many states. CDC works with immunization programs to collect and report data on school vaccination coverage, exemption rates, and grace period and provisional enrollment each year. Immunization programs can use these data to understand and address undervaccination among kindergartners and to identify schools and communi-ties where focused interventions could improve coverage with required vaccines.

Summary What is already known about this topic? Immunization programs conduct annual kindergarten vaccination assessments to monitor school-entry vaccination coverage for all state-required vaccines. What is added by this report? Median vaccination coverage was 94. 3% for 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine; 95. 1% for the state-required number of doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; and 93. 8% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine. Although the median exemption rate gradually increased for the third year in a row to 2. 2%, most undervaccinated children did not have exemptions. What are the implications for public health practice? School assessment allows immunization programs to target interventions to schools with undervaccinated kindergartners to increase compliance with state and local vaccination requirements.

Hill, MD, PhD1; Laurie D. Elam-Evans, PhD1; David Yankey, PhD1; James A. Singleton, PhD1; Yoonjae Kang, MPH1 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination by age 24 months against 14 potentially serious illnesses (1) . CDC used data from the 2017 National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) to assess vaccination coverage at national, state, territorial, and selected local levels among children aged 1935 months in the United States. Coverage remained high and stable overall, exceeding 90% for 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, 1 dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and 1 dose of varicella vaccine. Although the proportion of children who received no vaccine doses by age 24 months was low, this proportion increased gradually from 0. 9% for children born in 2011 to 1. 3% for children born in 2015. Coverage was lower for most vaccines among uninsured children and those insured by Medicaid, compared with those having private health insurance, and for children living out - side of metropolitan statistical areas* (MSAs), compared with those living in MSA principal cities. These disparities could be reduced with greater awareness and use of the Vaccines for Children  (VFC) program, eliminating missed opportunities to vaccinate children during visits to health care providers, and minimizing interruptions in health insurance coverage. The NIS-Child is a random-digitdialed telephone (cellular and landline) survey of parents/guardians of children aged 1935 months in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and U. S. territories.  NIS-Child coverage estimates are based on a provider-reported vaccination history. Interviewers request contact information for all the childs vaccination providers and permission to contact each provider to obtain vaccination records for that child. All identified * MSA status was determined on the basis of household-reported city and county of residence and was grouped into three categories: MSA principal city, MSA nonprincipal city, and non-MSA. MSAs and principal cities were as defined by the U. S. Census Bureau (https: //www. census. gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_cbsa. html) . Non-MSA areas include urban populations not located within an MSA as well as completely rural areas.  https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index. html.  Estimates for states, selected local areas, and the territory of Guam ar e available online (https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/ data-reports/index. html) . The local areas sampled separately for the 2017 NIS included areas that receive federal Section 317 immunization funds and are included in the NIS sample every year (Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas) and three additional sample areas (El Paso County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; and T ravis County, Texas) . The 2017 NIS-Child was also conducted in Guam, Puerto Rico, and U. S. Virgin Islands; however, data collection in Puerto Rico and U. S. Virgin Islands was suspended because of the severity of the 2017 hurricane season, resulting in insufficient data for estimation of vaccination coverage. National estimates in this report exclude all territories. providers are mailed an immunization history questionnaire to record dates and types of vaccines administered; data from responding providers are combined to create a synthesized vaccination history for each child. NIS-Child methods, includ - ing weighting procedures, have been described.  In 2017, the overall response rate** to the telephone interview portion of the survey was 26. 1%. Adequate provider-reported vaccination data  were available for 53. 9% of children with a completed household interview, resulting in a sample size of 15, 333 chil - dren. T-tests on weighted data were used to evaluate differences in coverage estimates by sociodemographic characteristics; differences were considered statistically significant for p-values <0. 05. CDC assessed changes in survey accuracy, estimated components of difference between the 2016 and 2017 NIS-Child estimates, and estimated linear trends in vaccination coverage by month and year of birth using weighted linear regression.  No evidence for change in survey accuracy from 2016 to 2017 was detected (2) . 2017 Vaccination Coverage Coverage was >90% for vaccination with 3 doses of polio - virus vaccine (92. 7%), 1 dose of MMR (91. 5%), 3 doses of HepB (91. 4%), and 1 dose of varicella vaccine (91. 0%) (Table 1) . Children were least likely to be up-to-date with 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) (59. 7%), the combined 7-vaccine series  (70. 4%), and rotavirus vaccination (73. 2%) . Coverage with HepB birth dose was also low (73. 6%) .  Details regarding the statistical methodology of NIS-Child are available in the NIS-Child Data Users Guide 2016. https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/imzmanagers/nis/datasets. html. ** The Council of American Survey R esearch Organizations (CASRO) household response rate is calculated as the product of the resolution rate (percentage of the total telephone numbers called that were classified as nonworking, nonresidential, or residential), screening completion rate (percentage of known households that were successfully screened for the presence of age-eligible children), and the interview completion rate (percentage of households with one or more age-eligible children that completed the household survey) . The CASRO household response rate is equivalent to the American Association for Public Opinion Research type 3 response rate. http: //www. aapor. org/AAPOR_ Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal. pdf.  Children with at least one vaccination reported by a provider and those who had received no vaccinations were considered to have adequate provider data.  https: //www. cdc. gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/childvaxview/pubs-presentations/NIS-vax-trends-2012-2016. html.  The combined 7-vaccine series (4: 3: 1: 3*: 3: 1: 4) includes 4 doses of DTaP; 3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine; 3 or 4 doses (depending upon product type) of Hib; 3 doses of Hep-B; 1 dose of varicella vaccine; and 4 doses of PCV. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1124 MMWR / Oct ober 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionVaccination Coverage by Selected Characteristics Coverage was lower (range = 2. 66. 9 percentage points) for children living in non-MSAs than among those living in MSA principal cities for most vaccines (Table 2) . Children living in non-MSAs had a higher prevalence of having received no vaccinations (1. 9%) compared with children in MSA principal cities (1. 0%) . Coverage among children insured by Medicaid was lower (2. 515. 0 percentage points, depending on vaccine) than that among those with private insurance for all vaccines assessed except the HepB birth dose (Table 2) . The same pattern was observed among uninsured children: coverage was substantially lower (14. 730. 3 percentage points) than that among those privately insured. Prevalence of uninsured children in the 2017 NIS-Child was 2. 8%. This lower vaccination coverage among the uninsured, Medicaid-insured, and those living outside of MSAs was especially evident for diphtheria and tetanus tox - oids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), the full series of Haemophilius influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib), and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), that require a booster dose in the second year of life. In addition, the proportion of uninsured children who had received no vaccinations (7. 1%) was higher than that among those with private insurance (0. 8%) . The proportion of unvaccinated children was similar among children insured by Medicaid and those with private insurance. Among unvaccinated children in the 2017 NIS-Child, 17. 2% were uninsured. Differences in vaccination coverage by race/ethnicity and poverty status in 2017 were similar to those observed in previous years (Supplementary Table 1, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/59414) (3) . Vaccination coverage also varied by state (Supplementary Table 2, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/TABLE 1.

For example, estimated rotavirus coverage ranged from 64. 7% in California to 85. 1% in Rhode Island. Coverage with MMR ranged from 85. 8% in Missouri to 98. 3% in Massachusetts; MMR coverage was <90% for 11 states in 2017. Trends in Vaccination Coverage Coverage by month and year of birth remained stable during January 2012January 2016 for most vaccines (Figure) (2) . Coverage by age 2 years over 12 consecutive birth months declined by 0. 5 percentage points for 3 HepB doses and increased by 1. 1 percentage points for 2 HepA doses (2) .

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1126 MMWR / Oct ober 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionchildren increased from 0. 8% in 2016 to 1. 1% in 2017. By annual birth cohort, the percentage of children with no vac - cinations by age 2 years increased from 0. 9% for children born in 2011 to 1. 3% (47, 700 children) for those born in 2015 (Supplementary Figure, https: //stacks. cdc. gov/view/cdc/59413), representing an additional 18, 400 unvaccinated children. Discussion Overall vaccination coverage among young children remained high and stable in the United States in 2017. However, the findings from this survey highlight several opportunities for improvement. Coverage was lower for most vaccines among uninsured and Medicaid-insured children and among children living outside of MSAs. These disparities were larger for vaccines that require a booster dose in the second year of life (e. g. , DTaP, Hib, and PCV) . Although the number of children who have received no vaccinations by age 24 months has been gradually increasing, most children are still routinely vaccinated. Continued evaluation of prevalence and reasons for nonvaccination is needed, as are improvements in access to and delivery of age-appropriate vaccinations to all children. CDC continues to examine barriers to early childhood vaccination, including assessing obstacles to and parents experiences with accessing vaccination services. Vaccination coverage differences by insurance status are concerning, given that children insured by Medicaid and uninsured children are eligible for the VFC program, which was designed to remove financial barriers by providing free vaccines to program participants. However, other issues, such as unfamiliarity with the VFC program and how to access it, transportation, child care, and convenience of clinic hours might also need to be addressed if the goals of this important element of the immunization safety net are to be fully real - ized. Lack of geographic proximity to vaccination providers, including those who participate in the VFC program, can be a barrier to vaccination. The shortage of health care provid-ers, especially pediatricians, might partially explain the lower coverage among children living in rural areas (4) . FIGURE.

Rotavirus: 2 or 3 doses, depending on product type received (2 doses for Rotarix [RV1] or 3 doses for RotaTeq [RV5]) .  Except for rotavirus, vaccination coverage was assessed before the child reached his/her 24-month birthday. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to account for censoring vaccination status for children assessed before age 24 months. Rotavirus vaccination was assessed before the child reached his/her 8-month birthday.  Estimated linear relationship between month and year of birth and vaccination coverage, based on weighted linear regression analysis using the inverse of the estimated variance of each point estimate to construct the weights.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / October 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 1127 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionVaccination coverage could be increased and sociodemo - graphic and geographic disparities reduced with increased administration of all recommended vaccines during provider visits. A study of potentially achievable coverage estimated that 90% coverage would have been attained many years ago for the recommended number of doses of DTaP, PCV, and Hib for children aged 1935 months if missed opportunities for administration of the final doses of these vaccines had been eliminated (5) . Reducing missed opportunities would promote timely receipt of all recommended vaccine doses and decrease the amount of time that children remain vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. The percentage of children who have received no vaccines has increased, reaching 1. 3% for children born in 2015, com - pared with 0. 3% among those 1935 months when surveyed in 2001 (6) . Some children might be unvaccinated because of choices made by parents, whereas for others, lack of access to health care or health insurance might be factors. Unvaccinated children in the 2017 NIS-Child were disproportionately unin - sured: 17. 2% of unvaccinated children were uninsured, com - pared with 2. 8% of all children. Evidence-informed strategies addressing parents decisions about vaccinating their children could focus on both programs and individual patients, such as vaccine delivery through school programs, strong recom - mendations by providers to parents to vaccinate their children, and reinforcement of the importance of community protection through vaccination (7) . Variation in coverage by health insurance and MSA status and the increasing percentage of unvaccinated children raise concerns about possible pockets of susceptibility in which children are not as well protected as national coverage estimates might indicate. Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, yet outbreaks caused by imported cases continue to occur each year; 118 measles cases were reported in 2017 (https: //www. cdc. gov/measles/cases-outbreaks. html) (8) . The continued occurrence of measles outbreaks in the United States underscores the need to ensure high MMR coverage among all young children. The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita - tions. First, low response rates and lack of access to phoneless households could result in selection bias, which might persist even with application of survey weights designed to minimize such bias. Second, vaccination histories might be incomplete if not all providers were identified or some of those identified chose not to participate. Bias in vaccination coverage estimates has been evaluated in a sensitivity analysis accounting for these potential errors, with results indicating underestimation of actual vaccination coverage by 4 to 5 percentage points (9) . Vaccination coverage among young children could be improved through higher participation by both children and providers in the Vaccines for Children program. Consistent access to health insurance is another important element of the immunization safety net. Barriers to participation in the VFC program should be identified and eliminated so that all eligible children have the opportunity to access recommended vaccines. A number of evidence-based strategies have also been described that could enhance these efforts to increase vacci - nation coverage, such as notifying parents when children are due for a vaccination, establishing standing orders or policies that allow nonphysician personnel to administer vaccines, and enhancing computerized immunization information systems for tracking vaccinations (https: //www. thecommunityguide. org/topic/vaccination) (10) . Continued vaccination coverage assessment using the NIS-Child can guide efforts to improve vaccination coverage and protect children from vaccine-pre-ventable diseases and better understand the low but increasing prevalence of nonvaccination.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine vaccination by age 24 months against 14 potentially serious illnesses. What is added by this report? In 2017, coverage with most recommended vaccines among children aged 1935 months remained stable and high but was lower in more rural areas and among uninsured or Medicaid-insured children. A small but increasing proportion of children received no vaccines by age 24 months. What are the implications for public health practice? Collaboration with state immunization programs, eliminating missed immunization opportunities, and minimizing interrup - tions in insurance coverage are important to understand and address coverage disparities among children eligible for the Vaccines for Children program and those in rural areas.

Yaglom, MS, MPH6; Dallin Peterson, MPH7; Melissa Peek-Bullock8; Mary J. Choi, MD2; Anat Wieder-Finesod, MD3; John D. Klena, PhD2; Heather Venkat, DVM5; Cheng-Feng Chiang, PhD2; Barbara Knust, DVM2; Marlene Gaither, MPA, MSEV9; Matthew Maurer, MPH10; Donald R. Hoeschele, MS11; Stuart T. Nichol, PhD2 In November 2017, CDC confirmed Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection in a previously healthy man aged 47 years who was admitted to a hospital in Israel. The patient had trav - eled with his family on vacation to the southwestern United States (Arizona, Nevada, and Utah) during October 39, 2017. During this time, he and his family hiked and biked the southern rim of the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park and took a guided tour through Antelope Cave. On November 7, approximately 3 weeks after his return to Israel, he was hospitalized with fever, cough, and shortness of breath requiring bilevel positive airway pressure. A chest radiograph indicated diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates with consolida - tions at the right costophrenic angle and in the retrocardiac space. Based upon the patients travel history and clinical findings, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was suspected. A blood specimen collected on November 9 tested positive for SNV using nested reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reac - tion; he had an immunoglobulin M titer of 1: 6, 400 and an immunoglobulin G titer of 1: 6, 400. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has a mortality rate of approximately 36%. * The patient was treated with supportive care and discharged from the hospital on November 19. No illness was reported in any family member who traveled with him. SNV is a species of hantavirus that is transmitted to humans primarily through contact with the infected urine or drop - pings of a deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) . Deer mice are present throughout most of the continental United States, but transmission is most common in the Four Corners region (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) (1 3) . The average incubation period is 15 weeks after exposure. There is no human-to-human transmission of SNV, and clustering of cases is uncommon. The patient did not report any known contact with rodents, rodent nests, or rodent droppings either in his places of lodging or during the course of his recreational activities. * https: //www. cdc. gov/hantavirus/surveillance/annual-cases. html. An environmental investigation conducted by the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Utah Department of Health did not find any evidence of rodent infestation at the inns and hotels where the patient and his family stayed during their travels. In Antelope Cave, evidence of rodent burrowing was identified in areas around the canyon entrances as well as at the juncture of the canyon floor and walls. In addition, tour guides are known to throw sand from the canyon floor into the air to better illuminate the sunlight beams entering the canyon for photography, which could expose visitors to aerosolized rodent feces. This case represents the first confirmed instance of SNV infection exported from the United States. Although no clear source of the patients exposure was found, it likely occurred during the course of his recreational outdoor activities. Clinicians and public health practitioners should be aware of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as a potential illness among travelers returning from the southwestern United States. T ravelers to this region of the United States should also be informed of the risk factors for hantavirus exposure and methods for risk reduction through public health education materials at popular tourist sites, and tour guide operators should be encouraged to leave the canyon floor undisturbed during their programs.

Burdsall, PhD5; Mary Alice Lavin, MJ5; Stephanie R. Black, MD1 On November 1, 2016, a point prevalence survey conducted at a Chicago skilled nursing facility with ventilated residents (vSNF A) to understand the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing organisms in health care facilities in the Chicago region identified 20 patients with Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (VIM-CRPA) colonization. To deter-mine the extent of VIM-CRPA colonization at vSNF A and provide infection control recommendations, the Chicago Department of Public Health conducted an investigation. The first VIM-CRPA outbreak reported in the United States occurred in a Chicago acute care hospital in 2003 (1) . Other outbreaks have been described; however, none was associated with a single skilled nursing facility (25) . Carbapenemaseproducing CRPA are uncommon in the United States; a sur - veillance pilot for CRPA at five U. S. sites identified only two carbapenemase-producing CRPA among 129 isolates tested (CDC, unpublished data, 2017) . To determine whether ongoing transmission was occurring at vSNF A, the Chicago Department of Public Health conducted 10 additional point prevalence surveys during November 2016March 2018. Rectal specimens were collected from all residents, and tracheostomy site specimens were collected from residents with tracheostomies. vSNF A is a licensed 312-bed facility; point prevalence surveys were conducted on a floor with standard skilled nursing (SN floor) and on a floor hous - ing residents with a tracheostomy or who were mechanically ventilated (VT floor) . During November 2016March 2018, collection of 903 screening swabs from 209 residents identified 38 residents with VIM-CRPA colonization. One additional colonized resi - dent was identified by a rectal screening culture collected on admission to an acute care hospital. Among the 39 residents, four (10%) resided on the SN floor and 35 (90%) on the VT floor. Thirty (77%) had positive rectal swabs, four (10%) had positive tracheostomy swabs, and five (13%) had positive swabs from both sites. Floor prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of VIM-CRPApositive residents present on the day of the point prevalence survey by the total number of residents present. Prevalences ranged from 0% to 6% on the SN floor and 21% to 43% on the VT floor during November 2016March 2018 (Table) . Among the 18 additional residents with VIM-CRPA identified after the November 2016 point prevalence survey, 17 (94%) previously had screened negative at vSNF A, rep - resenting probable incident transmission events (Table) . No additional residents with VIM-CRPA were identified during the last two consecutive point prevalence surveys on the SN floor and the last four on VT floors. During November 2016July 2017, point prevalence surveys were conducted at six other vSNFs and six long-term acute care hospitals in the Chicago region. T welve additional VIM-CRPA positive patients were identified at five vSNFs and one long-term acute care hospital; facility prevalences ranged from 1% to 4%. Whole genome sequencing performed on 26 isolates from five different facilities, including 19 from vSNF A, and two historical isolates from 2003 found that all contained the VIM-2 allelic variant, and 25 were multilocus sequence type (ST) 233 (others were ST 277, 708, and 875) . * The ST233 isolates were identified across the five facilities and, using a core genome multilocus sequence typing analysis, clustered separately from epidemiologically unlinked ST233 isolates from CDCs reference collection. In addition, clusters of highly related isolates (differences ranging from one to 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were consistent with transmis - sion in vSNF A. These results suggest that a common strain of VIM-CRPA has had a longstanding presence in this region, with recent transmission in vSNF A. The Chicago Department of Public Health provided ongo - ing on-site assessments to monitor infection control practices. Improvements were made in hand hygiene and isolation pre - cautions compliance, resident cohorting, bathing practices, and environmental cleaning. The facility also stopped rinsing respi - ratory equipment with tap water in sinks in residents rooms. This is the largest health careassociated cluster of VIMCRPA isolates colonizing residents reported in the United States to date. Although centered in one vSNF, this investiga - tion highlights the interconnectedness of health care facilities * Raw sequencing reads were placed under B ioProject ID PRJNA474674.

Application of CDCs multidrug-resistant organisms containment guidance (6), including comprehensive on-site assistance and coloni - zation screening, limited transmission at the index facility despite continued high prevalence. Improved availability of carbapenem resistance mechanism testing and screening tests are critical for early identification of and response to similar clusters.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1132 MMWR / Oct ober 12, 2018 / Vol. 67 / No. 40 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionNotes from the Field Rubella Infection in an Unvaccinated Pregnant Woman  Johnson County, Kansas, December 2017 Tiffany Wallin1; Elizabeth Holzschuh, MS2; Caitlin Kintner, MPH1 On December 14, 2017, a school nurse notified the Johnson County (Kansas) Department of Health and Environment (JCDHE) that a students mother (patient) had received a diagnosis of rubella. The school nurse learned of the patients diagnosis when the patient picked up her daughter at school the day of the diagnosis. Follow-up by JCDHE revealed that the U. S. -born patient, aged 27 years, was 19 weeks pregnant and had not been vaccinated against rubella because of personal choice. She had tested negative for rubella by immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology during her first trimester of pregnancy. On December 6, the patient visited a hospital emergency department complaining of palpitations, a burning, itchy rash, and fever. On December 9, she visited a second emergency department and was told she was having an allergic reaction. After conducting an Internet search, she suspected her symp - toms might be caused by rubella and contacted her obstetrician, who referred her to a primary care provider. On December 12, the primary care provider submitted a blood specimen to a commercial laboratory for rubella immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing, which was reported as positive on December 14; the provider informed the patient but did not notify JCDHE. JCDHE determined the patient had no travel history. When the patient was 15 weeks pregnant (17 days before her rash onset), her unvaccinated U. S. -born brother, aged 22 years, stayed in her home after returning from India, a country with endemic rubella transmission. The brother had a rash on his lower extremities that was diagnosed as poison ivy. Specimens from the patient and brother were collected and submitted to CDC; results were rubella IgG-positive with low avidity, indicating recent infection. Among approximately 120 contacts of the patient, three were not vaccinated, including the patients daughter, aged 11 years, one hospital staff member, and the patients female coworker at a call center. All three were advised to avoid contact with pregnant women for 23 days; the patients daughter and the hospital staff member were excluded from school and work, respectively, for 21 days. Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by low birthweight and birth defects including deafness, cataracts, heart defects, and intellectual disabilities (1) . The severity and nature of defects depend upon the ges - tational age of the fetus at the time of infection. The risk for CRS ranges from 10%90% and is highest when infection occurs during the first trimester (2) . Endemic transmission of rubella was eliminated in the United States in 2004 as a result of high levels of coverage with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) (1) . An obstetrician specializing in high-risk pregnancies followed the patient for the remainder of her pregnancy. All follow-up testing was negative, and the patient delivered a full-term, apparently normal, infant in May. Echocardiogram, skeletal survey, head ultrasound, hearing, and eye exams were normal. The infants initial rubella IgM was positive, and two sets of nasopharyngeal and urine specimens, obtained 30 days apart, were negative for rubella RNA by reverse transcriptionpoly-merase chain reaction. Until negative results for rubella virus were received, the infant was considered infectious. Based on test results and the absence of congenital defects, indications are that this infant meets the criteria for congenital rubella infection and not CRS (3) . The infant will continue to be followed by an infectious disease specialist. This case highlights several important points. Per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recom - mendations, health care institutions should ensure that all persons working in health care facilities have documentation of adequate vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella or evidence of immunity (4); the hospital staff member who was excluded received the MMR vaccine before returning to work. Health care providers should routinely assess women of childbearing age for evidence of rubella immunity (IgG antibodies) and recommend vaccination when appropri - ate. Pregnant women testing negative for rubella immunity should be vaccinated immediately after delivery (4); this case represents a missed opportunity for rubella vaccination after the birth of the patients first child. When a pregnant woman develops a rash illness, providers should ask about international travel for both the patient and her contacts. Finally, more emphasis and education are required for health care providers on the importance of timely reporting of suspected vaccine-preventable diseases.
